The whole “war in heaven” and battle between the angels is part of Christian teaching but simply does not feature in Judaism at all. There is an angel, or possibly a group of angels, traditionally referred to as “the Satan”. Angels have no free will and can only do as they are told to do by the divine will in Jewish teaching, so these beings are not evil- their job is, in traditional stories, to do quality control on humanity and report back their findings. They are no more “evil” than someone in a factory performing stress tests on a new product. But they do try to tempt humans to do evil. That’s their job- to test people out and see how they respond to the temptation to do bad things. They aren’t that invested in the out come though- they don’t get the souls to play with in hell or anything, they just expose the flaws in creation and find the weak spots."},{"prompt":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","completion":"Kippers in custard. Really."},{"prompt":"My mom refuses to give my dad my passport and other documents. What can my dad do (he's my biological, but his name isn't on my birth certificate)?","completion":"If your dad raised you, he has parental rights in most states regardless of biology so it doesn't matter if he is on your birth certificate. He can go to court and get his parental rights validated and the judge will deal with the passport issue. If your biological father did not raise you then he needs to go to Family Law Court with the DNA proof and establish himself as your father. The court will usually grant a visitation schedule for the additional family member (the court does this with grandparents also) and if your father wants to take you traveling (in or out of the country) he can request that the court allow for this. If the court approves the travel, then your mother will be forced to give him your passport. Or, you can wait until you're 18 and travel with your father as a young adult. Please remember that your mother knew your father as an adult before you were born (obviously). She may have reason to hold back your passport. She may be trying to protect you, so her stubborn refusal may have very good intentions. Non-custodial parents leaving the country and not returning with their children is an ongoing problem in Family Law Courts and a horrible, living nightmare for the parent left behind. It is nearly impossible to get children back to the U.S. from certain countries, even if the children want to return. For this reason, all parents who are not married and want to travel internationally with their children must go through channels to prove that they will return with their children. Your father is no exception. Lawyers are not required to appear in Family Law Court, neither is U.S. citizenship. There is a self help desk at the courthouse that will help your father go to court to get a judge to decide about the passport. It will be a good test for him to see if he is willing to go through the process or if he is just trying to take you away from your mother to live with his family. It is best for you to have all of the people who love you in your life. I hope that your parents will work together (and let the court assist them) to make this happen."},{"prompt":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","completion":"Just open with MS office word 2010 or later version and choose pdf format at the time of saving"},{"prompt":"What are the three components of the cell theory?","completion":"The universe is assessed to contain somewhere in the range of 100 and 200 billion worlds.

It had never occurred to me that resumes are being combed through by someone other than the person doing the hiring. Here is my experience though: During the Great Recession I applied at Macy’s for a seasonal Christmas job in 2009. I was overqualified for this retail position of stocking shelves or operating a cash register, but I felt I needed to apply to anything out there. They could see my job experience on my resume but I was called in for an interview. I sat before a girl half my age and she told me that the job was already filled. If this were true, then why would they not have called to cancel the interview? I felt that they were screening out people that were “too old”. The next year 2010 I was STILL unemployed and now I am feeling desperate since there had been no openings in my field. Again, I saw the ad for Macy’s seasonal help and I applied again. It was like deja vu. I was called in for an interview, I came in and sat before someone half my age, and again was told the position had been filled. While I was uncertain the year before that Macy’s would screen out people based on age, now I was certain they do. Fortunately after New Years 2011, I was able to get employment in my field. If there are any Macy’s executives out there reading this, shame on you. You have terrible employment practices. I boycott your store and I hope others do as well. UPDATE: IN 2018 the local Macy’s store closed it’s doors for good. I guess boycotting stores with bad business practices works."},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"Not the US government, it was the British government, when the USA was still a group of colonies. Here are some of the big reasons. But if you want to know why the USA is the way it is, read the declaration of Independence. The governor's of the colonies were unable to pass laws of “great local importance” in the colonies without assent from the king. The king refused to pass laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless the people gave up their right of representation in the legislature. The king called legislative bodies together at odd unusual and distant locations. The king routinely dissolved legislative bodies in the colonies. After the dissolution of those bodies the king stalled elections to reelect new bodies The king obstructed the creation of laws to implement judiciary bodies in the colonies Judges were dependent on the king's will for tenure of their offices and salary Armies were stationed in the colonies in times of peace without concent of the colonies The cost of those unwanted standing armies was charged to the colonies.

What do I do?","completion":"Things to Do Differently If You’re Working Out Regularly but Not Seeing the Workout Results You Want 1. Make small but meaningful changes to your current routine. Sometimes tweaking your go-to workout (as well as adding some completely new exercises) can make a difference. \\"For example, at Flywheel where I teach, if you do the same RPM [or speed] but increase intensity, it’s a different workout,\\" celebrity trainer Lacey Stone, tells SELF. \\"If you increase the speed on the treadmill by one or two [miles per hour], it’s a different workout.\\" Lifting heavier than normal, or working out for longer, can both be helpful changes, too. Aguiar adds, \\"Make sure you’re only changing one thing at a time, and be very specific.\\" If you're increasing the weight you're lifting, don't also add reps. \\"Pick one thing—duration, intensity, or load. 2. Take active recovery days. Active recovery is any workout that gets you moving but still lets your muscles recover fully—which is important so your body can reap the benefits of exercise without getting too burned out. A slow run, long walk, and yoga are all great forms of active recovery. This is a great way to keep your body moving (and burning more calories than you would if you took a full-on rest day) while still giving your body and mind a much-needed break from strenuous activity. 3. Watch portion sizes. There are several problems with counting calories for weight loss. For one, it can be annoying and time-consuming to track every single bite. In addition, calculating how many calories you need is incredibly complicated, and most formulas are inaccurate. A better solution for many people is to be mindful of portion sizes. To be honest, it can be really hard to control portion sizes, especially if you're eating out at restaurants and being served two times the size of a healthy portion. 4. Try something completely different. \\"If you are somebody who does the same thing every time and you have been doing that for years, then you need to switch it up,\\" Chelsea Aguiar, founder of Athaya Fitness, tells SELF. When your body gets used to the same movements, it no longer has to adapt to keep up. \\"During physique changes and body composition changes, your body is adapting. When you're trying to make progress, you always want your workout to feel challenging. 5. Prioritize sleep. Weight loss especially is impacted by so many more factors than just diet and exercise. Getting poor sleep can sabotage your weight-loss efforts in a few ways. Being sleep-deprived impacts the hormones that control appetite, urging you to snack and prompting you to reach for quick energy—usually highly caloric sugary and fatty foods. Lack of sleep can also slow down your metabolism and simply leave you with too little energy to work out. 6. Work out less often. This might sound counterintuitive, but if you're working out so frequently that you're feeling burnt out, you may not really be getting much out of some of those workouts. Fitness pros emphasize the importance of taking a break so your body can recovery properly and so you have enough energy to come back to your next workout full force. If you're hitting the gym every single day and feeling exhausted, take a day off, get some rest, and see if you have more energy and stamina during your next workout.

I’m 46 and have lived my entire life in Cerritos, California, which is about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Cerritos and Southern California are both nice enough and have a lot to offer, but I’m ready to move on nevertheless. For one, it’s so populated and crowded here. There’s very little nature or open space left anywhere in So. Cal — and for a nature-loving guy, that just sucks. It’s basically wall-to-wall development, with an endless array of freeways, strip malls, housing developments, and cities. To access nature or to simply go on a country drive, one has to drive long distances, either up into the mountains or way out in some of the less developed parts of the Inland Empire. Being surrounded by so much asphalt and concrete and sprawl is rather depressing! Second, the traffic and overcrowdedness of the area is stifling. Virtually no place in So. Cal is immune from traffic jams and gridlock. Even some of the more rural areas in the I.E have bad traffic. And forget about driving up to the mountains to ski or play in the snow right after a fresh snowfall: half of So. Cal is likely going to be heading up there, too, which means heavy traffic both going up and down the mountain. And if chains are required at all, get ready for a really frustrating adventure! And the beaches? Good luck finding a parking spot on a warm, sunny day. And if you do find a spot, get ready to spend a good sum for the privilege. Lastly, I find the weather/climate here boring and dull. Sunny Southern California is a very real thing. It’s nice, however, in that we lack the extreme heat and cold that impacts other areas of the country; we don’t get hurricanes or tornadoes; we don’t get blizzards and ice storms; and we don’t get oppressive heat and humidity very often — so the So. Cal climate patterns are generally mild. However, the lack of rain, the constant sunshine, and the unseasonably long summer season (generally we stay warm well into November) gets a bit dull and monotonous. It’s not rare for it to be 80 degrees on Thanksgiving and Christmas, which is nice if you are a surfer, but abysmal if you like the holiday weather to reflect the actual time of year. I’m thinking of moving somewhere less congested, less populated, and with a bit more seasonal variety."},{"prompt":"What are the arguments for and against whether a human fertilized egg at the moment of conception is a person or not?","completion":"“Person” is defined in the law, and it includes, for natural persons (as opposed to corporate persons) the word “birth”.

It’s one of the many (failed) options they use to try to place themselves beyond legal jurisdiction. It doesn’t work out that way though… It’s another attempt at sophistry. They’re under the impression that if they create enough confusion and doubt as to whether the laws apply to them, that they can do what they want without any consequences. Sovereign citizens have several explanations of where America went wrong, but the basic thinking argues that, at some point, popular sovereignty was abandoned in favour of admiralty law—the law of the sea and international commerce. According to the [LINKED_TEXT: Southern Poverty Law Center] [URL: https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement]: \\"Under common law, or so they believe, the sovereigns would be free men. Under admiralty law, they are slaves, and secret government forces have a vested interest in keeping them that way.\\" And so sovereigns assert that when they are tried at a court flying an admiralty flag (i.e., an American flag with gold fringe), said court holds no jurisdiction over them and the case should be dropped. Further, that \\"some point\\" where the U.S. forfeited its legitimacy is in dispute. Many sovereigns maintain it was with the ratification of the [LINKED_TEXT: 13th] [URL: https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiii] and [LINKED_TEXT: 14th Amendments] [URL: https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv]. According to Kalinowski, \\"Sovereign Citizens believe that the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, caused problems for the federal government because up until that point, 'slaves were not citizens of any state or country, because they were just property, and property did not have citizenship.' To rectify this problem, according to Sovereign Citizens, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified so as to create 'a new class of citizenship.' This new citizenship was a 'privilege' granted by the federal government, unsupported by the 'sovereign inalienable right.' \\" ([LINKED_TEXT: Source] [URL: https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a30281693/sovereign-citizen-right-to-travel/]) Yes.

The Xbox One is a home console, that you play just on your TV and can’t be taken with you on your daily commute or played in a portable manner. The PSvita, on the other hand, is a portable console, so you are basically playing it on the go, wherever you want. BUT, and it is a big BUT, the PSVita was discontinued and other than some indie games that are coming out for it, the console is NOT getting any new AAA titles or any major game releases, so you’re playing whatever games they have available.

Where as India is the 2nd largest economy after China in the sub continent. Once upon a time Bangladesh was a follower of Pakistan in respect of religious fundamentalism, terrorism and backwardness as long as Bangladesh was being controlled by the pro Pak rulers and people.

The sum of the first n positive integers can be calculated as follows: S = n * (n + 1) / 2 Where n is the number of positive integers you want to sum. In this case, n = 10, so the sum of the first 10 positive integers is: S = 10 * (10 + 1) / 2 = 55 So the answer is 55. This method is much faster than adding the numbers one by one, especially for larger values of n."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":". Because Kannada people are more into science and Technology. The Kannada mindset and Kannada culture is highly influenced to go into medical sciences and Commerce rather than Movies or IT. It's like we are Bengalis of South when it comes to our interest in Bio sciences. Kannadigas are the Technology-Brains behind all Technological advancements in India. Starting from Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty form Kinnigoli to Alsuru Kiran Kumar of ISRO, Kannadigas are the science-brains behind every new advancement in India. Kannadigas are more into biology and technology rather than movies. Just because other South Indians are into movies doesn't mean we are any lesser than others. Movies are just a platform to show a culture. Agreed. But that doesn't mean movies only define your culture.

Behind every technological advancement in India, there will always be a Kannada person's brain. Do you know Kannada people have been the best bowlers for India? What about cricket? Let's talk about cricket — because Kannada people are fabulous in cricket. Remember Kannada people like Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Roger Binny, KL Rahul. Is there any other state that has produced such amazing cricketers? The answer is : only Karnataka The greatest ever Kannadiga cricket player must have been Gundappa Vishwanath. The truth is : Most Kannada people are into science and technology (mainly commerce and medical sciences). If you got in the field of medical surgery, many of the best surgeons are all Kannadigas. In sharp contrast, Many Tamils and Telugus are into IT sector. And since IT sector gets a lot of too much hype these Tamils and Telugus get noticed so much as if Kannadigas never really existed. Lol. Go into medical sciences: you will see Kannada people at the top rung.

I was a school nurse a few years ago, and one of the students came in just a couple weeks after school started (in September). She said she wanted a pregnancy test – so I said sure, and proceeded to ask her a few questions – when was her last period – if she has any other symptoms – she said no. She was about a week and 1/2 late and it was the beginning of the school so she was a little stressed out like everyone else. I did the test in front of her and it was negative. I explained to her that she is a little too early to test positive and she was welcome to come back in a few weeks or earlier if she wants to. We had buckets of these tests, and we paid so little for it so whoever wanted one we just did it. I told her next time she has sex she should be more careful. She blushed and she said it was a boy she worked with at a summer camp. She showed me his picture on her telephone and we agreed that he was quite cute. [addendum: I giggled and she said, “Isn’t he cute?” I said, “Yes, he is!”] So I said well I hope you're not pregnant because you could be carrying his baby. She said oh she should've thought about it but it tasted so weird. I repeated what she said – \\"tasted so weird?\\" There were simply having oral sex – she said he called it 69. I said yes that's when you do it with another person at the same time. And she said he ejaculated in her mouth and she spat it out. I looked at her and she was so serious. I said to her that in order for her to be pregnant, his penis had to be in her vagina and he had to really ejaculate in there. The girl was completely clueless. She said during high school, her mother did not allow her to take the health class because (they are) very strict Catholics. I was thinking that how sad it was for the girl to have grown up not knowing how things work. She had never seen a naked boy before. I gave her a booklet which pretty much explains everything. We spent a few minutes talking about it. (She was not very shy and the way I spoke to her it was a matter-of-factly.) Luckily she still was staying in touch with the boy and they are planning to see each other perhaps on the weekends (they happen to be from the same city.) I told her it probably was a good idea to introduce him to her family. He was going to another college nearby and they seem to be happy together. I had a hidden supply of condoms which amazingly was sanctioned by the school and I gave her a few and I told her he needed to use this in case he wants to have sex with her. I also made an appointment for her to see our nurse practitioner who came in the afternoon and she basically put her on birth control pills. (She was already 18 1/2 and was able to decide this on her own without her parents' consent.) [addendum: She said to the NP that she’s a good Catholic girl, and she can’t use BCP. The NP said to her (very kindly) that she can’t cherry pick the pages of the Bible to follow. She said, “Look, you’re going to do it anyway and you might as well do it safely.” and the girl agreed. I just shook my head when I thought about it after she left. I never laughed at her because it was not anything funny and it wasn't really her fault. A few weeks later, she brought him by to introduce him to me. We had a nice talk and he said he too, read that booklet, and he wanted to thank me. Her parents like him and I believe they remained a couple for a long time and were pretty much in love. I teased her (in front of him) and said, “Bring him around on the campus to show him off!” (This is a girls’ school.) Most people feel that abstinence is the best way – being a school nurse – I disagree completely. Let’s be completely honest here- they are going to do it anyway and the chance of getting pregnant is high if they don't know what's going on. Regardless of what you think about abortion - having to go through one is far worse (especially emotionally) than preventing the pregnancy in the first place. [Addendum: I have disabled further comments. There are some that were getting close to questioning my actions, or my judgment (as a nurse.) I must tell you that they were already giving each other oral sex, and nothing I might have said would have stopped them from fucking each other. No alcohol was involved (as both did not drink), but they were very good looking, and they were full of hormones. If I had said nothing, she’d be back in a few months carrying his child. So I did the best I could - do the test, and provide her with the condoms and got her seen by the NP that afternoon and she was put on the pills. Both were virgins and had never been with anyone else so there were no STD to worry about. The story ended well. They became a loving couple and her parents liked him. What more do you want from me? I had not thought about “me too” movement then because it didn’t apply to this case. The poor girl was naive, but she wasn’t going to let this boy force her into anything else and they really liked each other and there was no forced sex involved. The comments regarding “me too” movements made the writers look like they overreacted and it didn’t help your movement one bit. I consulted my boss and the NP and they both agreed with my assessments and actions. That was good enough for me and I don’t need the public’s approval. The school approved what we did although it’s a Catholic school because it’s better to put them on the pills/condoms and teach them to do it safely than having to deal with a girl wanting an abortion. To the woman who says her 14 nieces and nephews are so wonderful, you probably can’t imagine them masturbating. If you don’t like it, keep your children at home and don’t let them watch TV or go on the internet.]"},{"prompt":"Which regions of Texas were settled by people from Appalachia?","completion":"I don’t know that people from Appalachia ever settled Texas in huge numbers though I’m sure some did.

Each warrior had unique strengths and achievements, making the decision complex. However, there are some prominent contenders for the title of the most powerful warrior: Bhishma: Bhishma was a central figure in the Mahabharata, known for his unmatched valor and impeccable skills in archery and combat. He was granted a boon of choosing the time of his death, making him nearly invincible until he chose to lay down his life. Bhishma's mastery in warfare and his unwavering commitment to righteousness earned him the title \\"Mahamaharathi\\" (the mightiest of warriors).Arjuna: Arjuna, the third Pandava prince, was an exceptional archer and a key figure in the Mahabharata. He received divine training and blessings from various gods, making him almost peerless in battle. Arjuna's skills with the bow, his knowledge of celestial weapons, and his unwavering dedication to Dharma (righteousness) made him a formidable opponent.Karna: Karna, the eldest Kaurava prince, was equally powerful and skilled as a warrior. He was known for his loyalty, charity, and bravery on the battlefield. Karna's mastery of archery was renowned, and he possessed a divine set of armor that made him nearly invulnerable. His martial abilities and his unyielding spirit made him one of the greatest warriors of his time.Dronacharya: Dronacharya, the royal teacher of the Kuru princes, was not only a great warrior but also a skilled strategist. He excelled in wielding various weapons and was a formidable force in battle. Dronacharya's teachings produced exceptional warriors like Arjuna and Karna.Krishna: While Krishna is renowned for his role as the charioteer and strategist for Arjuna, he is also considered an incarnation of the divine, possessing limitless power. Krishna's divine intervention, guidance, and blessings played a crucial role in shaping the outcomes of the war. In the epic, each warrior showcased remarkable might and prowess, and their achievements were influenced by various factors, including the circumstances of the battles, the divine blessings they received, and their adherence to Dharma. Ultimately, the Mahabharata demonstrates that power is not just physical strength but also includes wisdom, righteousness, and the divine blessings that shape the course of events in the epic narrative."},{"prompt":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","completion":"No, I’m a pacifist"},{"prompt":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","completion":"MacArthur park, I like Waylon Jennings version best"},{"prompt":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","completion":"It means, CAUTION.

The science-fiction trope is that the killer asteroid is spotted, 6 months from impact and everyone has to rush around to send nuclear weapons to destroy it. However, the truth is that nuclear weapons are a terrible solution to the problem - and if the asteroid is a large one - having just 6 month of notice is simply not enough. So “preparedness” isn’t about having fleets of spacecraft ready to launch at any moment. It’s really about having enough good telescopes to spot a “killer asteroid” decades before it’s going to be a problem. That gives time for considered thinking and planning on how to deflect (not destroy) it. The thing is - that if you can nudge the rock by even the smallest amount a decade or so before impact - that’s plenty good enough. If we had time, we might send a small exploratory probe to see what the composition and shape of the asteroid is - and then plan a deflection mission that might be a rocket that could push against it - or a “gravity tug” that would fly on a close parallel course and allow mutual gravity to slowly/gently change it’s course. That’s a good thing for loosely packed asteroids and asteroids made of ice and gravel. So - what we need is large telescopes - computers to find and track asteroids - and databases of known asteroids and their orbital components. Re-checking orbits of potential dangers. We also need a scale of “danger”. It turns out that we have ALL of those things - and right now, we can detect no large asteroids that are remotely likely to cause civilization-ending damage. The same cannot be said of much smaller rocks - but we’re getting better and better at spotting them. It has to be said though that a rock that could destroy an entire city could easily get through unnoticed until it was too late to deflect. In that case, we’d hope to have time to evacuate the city. But the odds of a city-killer actually hitting a city are pretty small - generally they land in deserted areas or in the ocean.

One has to invest time consciously and prudently to build relationships with alumni. It should be started early in their career. A conscious and focused effort can help one build their contacts and network over a period of time. Eg- Go for a trek or have a meetup with local alumni at your place on a weekend. · Be prudent about connections: It is also important to be prudent to choose with whom one may want to connect within given constraints. Eg- If your interests lie in technology and start-ups, it may not be worthwhile to be connected with someone who has interests in doing research on molecular biology unless it brings in different perspective. ·Be active: Be regular to attend college related events like annual alumni meets, batch reunions and any local chapter events and discussions. They are a good place to network with people and meet like minded people. It is also a good place to let people know about you. ·Improve visibility: Improve your visibility by not just attending events, but also by being an active volunteer for any of the events. Active participation in events or any discussions can help you improve your visibility. Eg- Why not take the initiative of starting fund raising campaign for your institute or start your own chapter in your city? ·Develop goodwill: Develop the attitude of giving first before seeking for help. If you can develop trust and goodwill, it shall reap benefits to you. Eg- Are you able to help someone when they are looking out for help in your city or when they are looking for expertise in areas where you are skilled? Sure, some day they have the gratitude to help you out when needed for what you have done earlier. ·Seek advice and guidance first: If you are looking for jobs or referrals, seek advice first as many people may be put off if you ask for jobs directly on the first go when you connect with them. Also, seek permission first before you directly ask someone to refer you for a job Eg- If you are planning to switch career or job to different place, seek advice on how to succeed and request if they can help you. ·Win-win: Do not exploit people but rather offer a win-win proposition while networking and when expecting help from your alumni. Eg- If you are looking for interns for your company, see how you can help them for their career progression and guide them in career. A win-win situation can help you foster your relations and get mutually benefited.

A trip to departmental store or groceries is easy as they have plenty of storage space. But mopeds have their limitations. The seating posture is not suitable for long rides compared to bikes. Secondly they are less fuel efficient than geared ones. Thirdly they are built for good roads, difficult to ride on poor roads due to their smaller tyre size. But it all depends on end user. Short ride to office, city roads then moped surely wins. On the other hand poor roads and long ride to work, geared ones win. One more thing for ladies, mopeds are best."},{"prompt":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","completion":"Vegetarian sources of protein Vegetarian sources include gram, pea, moong, lentils, urad, soybean, rajma, lobhiya(Indian food), wheat, maize. Meat, fish, poultry, milk, and liver are good carnivorous sources of protein. Soybean has the highest protein content in plant foods. It contains more than 40 percent protein. Boys in the age group of sixteen to eighteen, whose weight is 54 kg, require 4 grams of protein daily. Similarly, for girls of the same age group, whose weight is 50 kg, it is necessary to consume 43 grams of protein per day. For pregnant women, 43 grams, while for breastfeeding women (up to six months), it is necessary to consume 45 grams of protein per day. Vegetarian protein sources list Soybeans – Soybeans are more protein-rich than meats and eggs, in addition to protein, the soybean vitamin ‘B’ complex is rich in vitamin ‘E’ and minerals. Apart from this, soybean is also rich in fiber. 100 grams of soy chunks contain about 50 grams of protein.Paneer – All products made from milk are very beneficial for health, which helps in filling calcium deficiency in our body. Paneer is also prepared from milk and contains protein, carb, and fat. 100 grams of cheese have around 18 grams of protein.Moong dal – Moong dal is an inexpensive means of meeting protein deficiency because moong dal is rich in protein. About 24 grams of protein is found in just 100 grams of moong dal.Almonds – Almonds are rich in fat and rich in protein. About 21 grams of protein is found in 100 grams of almonds.

How can you simultaneously retain possession of Universalism heresy while also teaching the exact opposite in Vatican II and China?","completion":"Catholic priests must not contradict solemnly defined Church teaching, but there are many theological areas where teaching is not defined. When a Pope expresses his personal opinion, we should respect it because of his office, but we don't have to agree with him. Catholics are not called to be zombies. For example, Benedict XVI, God rest him, loved plainchant and some classical music for the Liturgy, and was not keen on many modern hymns. However, for primary school children, I do personally think that it is good to use simpler, livelier hymns which they can learn and join in with. It's also good to introduce them to chant, but what an 80-year old Bavarian Cardinal likes isn't an iron rule for every congregation. That said, I played a Gregorian chant CD before Mass and during Holy Communion this Sunday morning. Nor need we agree with the Vatican's current Sino-Politik. It seems to benefit the Chinese Communist Party rather than faithful Chinese Catholics. When a Pope or bishop seems to be obfuscating or confusing definitive Catholic teaching, then faithful Catholics have a right, even a duty, to speak out. The laity often have more freedom in this, because the errant local bishop is unable to sanction them. As Newman pointed out, in the fourth-century Arian crisis, it was the laity who substantially kept the orthodox Catholic faith, along with Athanasius and Hilary etc, while many bishops wavered or compromised with Arianism. I'm not sure what the OP has in mind when he mentions universalism, V2 and China."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"In the Chicago based many IT Companies but I suggest some best in the world IT Companies: [LINKED_TEXT: AppClues Infotech] [URL: https://www.appcluesinfotech.com/] AppClues Infotech is a Trusted Mobile App Development Company knows how mobile apps play a vital role in improving your business to reach new heights.

Your monthly earnings from blogging can grow significantly in years 2 through 5. According to Glassdoor, the average salary for bloggers is more than 50,000 per year, based on information from multiple anonymous sources. Many of the successful bloggers I know make over 200,000 per year and work 10-30 hours a week. I mentioned earlier that I've posted my income report where I made over 400,000 with my blogging side hustle. There are a few ways to make money through blogging. Google Adsense EARNING POTENTIAL 0.1 - 0.5 per page view/mo If you are a new blogger, Google Adsense is the easiest way to monetize your blog. However, you won't make a lot of money from them. Even if you are getting a thousand visitors a month, you might make 50 at most with Google Adsense. But that's a start! I used Google Adsense for the first year that I was blogging, and then switched to an ad network to get a higher cpm (cost per thousand impressions) and cpc (cost per click). Advertising/Publisher Networks Potential monthly blog revenue: 20,000+ If your website has at least 25,000 page views per month, you can stop using Google Adsense and start working with an advertising network. Ad networks, also called publisher networks, will place ads on your website and manage them to make sure you're making the most money possible. Usually, these networks take 20-40% of the revenue from the ads on your website. You have the potential to earn more money by working with an advertiser/publishing network than by working directly with Google, even with a commission. Some bloggers make an astonishing 20,000 per month from display ads alone. You can search for ad networks specializing in your niche by simply Googling \\"[your niche] ad networks.\\" Some of these networks can be quite selective about who they work with, so you may need to contact a couple of them. Affiliate Ads EARNING POTENTIAL 5 - 500 per click/mo you can get 20-50+ for a confirmed sign-up If you place affiliate ads on your website, you can make a lot of money from them. In almost any niche, you can make money by recommending products or services and getting paid every time someone signs up through your link. This is because advertisers will pay more for a confirmed sign-up than a click. You could get paid 1-3 per click, but you could get 20-50+ for a confirmed sign-up. Amazon Affiliate Ads If you link to an Amazon product listing from your blog, you can earn a commission on the sale if one of your readers buys the product. Amazon doesn't pay as much per sale as some other companies, but their affiliate platform is very user-friendly. The commission you earn on a sale is dependent on the price of the product you promoted. Affiliate ads can be extremely profitable for bloggers who write about electronics, cameras, and other high-priced items. For example, if someone clicks on an affiliate link and buys a TV, the blogger could earn up to 200 from that transaction. In some cases, bloggers can earn up to 10% commission on sales. Over time, those commissions can really add up. Sponsored Content As your blog grows in popularity, more and more people will approach you with offers to pay to have their content featured on your site. This happens to me regularly, with about 100 people a week reaching out and asking if I'll publish their post on Millennial Money. These offers typically range from 50 to 1,000. You might think that it's a lot of money to pay someone to post on your blog, but be careful. Google doesn't like this practice and if they think you are posting a lot of paid content, they could blacklist your blog. This would be terrible and would take forever to recover from. Be careful about how often you post sponsored content because the quality of the content and links is often poor. If you link to poor quality content, Google will notice and so will your audience. Be choosy about which sponsored content posts you accept, or charge a higher fee and write them yourself. Since I started writing Millennial Money two years ago, I've only agreed to do four sponsored posts. I ended up rewriting all of them myself and charging more for them, because I wanted to make sure they were up to my standards. Also, I only agreed to sponsored posts that were directly related to ideas and services that I already promote. Your readers and Google's reputation should be your top priority, so don't bombard your website with sponsored content."},{"prompt":"Are democrats happy with the 2020 RNC Convention so far?","completion":"Fact is if they are happy selecting Joe as their best candidate anything would make them happy.

He has no skills, no intelligence, can’t speak in a coherent stream of thought… He is also a criminal and a pretty obvious con artist. Why do you think he doesn’t want you to see his tax returns?!

As far as “everything we hate”… Well, yes, it’s true that we despise his position on just about everything. But that is not what has made him successful. Idiots that still think he’s a great guy, and cares about them, and continue to give him money, and still believe in him… That’s what makes him successful.

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","completion":"The two things you list, “Rent seeking” and “Turning a profit on ownership” are not equivalent notions. They are perhaps correlative in certain circumstance, but there is no inherent relationship. Rent seeking does not create any new wealth from which to profit. Instead it perverts markets in order to siphons away existing wealth by way of manipulation of governance or regulation.

I have been in about three dozen countries (including five where English is the main language or has official status), and I have never seen a single watch or a clock with numbers written in the English language. But this is on Earth (the third one from the Sun); other planets may vary."},{"prompt":"Why are scientists more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?","completion":"Water vapour is condensable at the temperatures found in the lower atmosphere. When its concentration exceeds about 3% of the atmosphere near the surface, it condenses and rains out of the atmosphere. As temperatures lower with altitude, it is even easier to condense the water. As a result, the water vapour percentage falls steeply above about 3 km as it condenses and is below 0.04% of the atmosphere above about 5 km. If we try to increase the water vapour concentration, it just condenses and rains out, maintaining less than 3% of the atmospheric concentration. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, does not condense at temperatures and pressures found in our atmosphere. Since the atmosphere is well mixed to about 100 km, its concentration comprises about 0.04% of the atmosphere all the way from the surface to about 80 km. As we increase the amount of carbon dioxide, its concentration continues to increase since it does not condense. Since the total atmospheric concentration falls with altitude, the concentrations of water vapour and carbon dioxide fall as well. The difference is that the water vapour falls off with altitude much more rapidly. This, as explained below, makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas. Now both water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb strongly in the infrared near 15 microns. They absorb so strongly, in fact, that when they re-emit the energy it does not travel far before it is re-absorbed by another water vapour or carbon dioxide molecule. However, if that energy is re-emitted upward, it sees less water vapour and carbon dioxide (since their concentrations fall with height). Eventually the concentrations are so low that the re-absorbed energy can escape to space. However, for water vapour, the escape altitude is about 3 km, where the temperature is about -13 C, and for carbon dioxide it is about 7 km where the temperature is about -53 C. The Earth tries to radiate the excess energy from the Sun to space by emitting so called blackbody radiation. The wavelength at which this radiation has it strongest power is proportional to its temperature of the emitter, and the total rate at which it emits that energy is proportional to its temperature raised to the fourth power (T^4). As it turns out, the Earth is about 15 C on average, and radiates to space most strongly at about 15 microns—right where water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb. Now the water vapour re-emits that energy to space at -13 C or about 1.5 times more slowly than the Earth emits its energy. However, the CO2 re-emits that energy to space at -53 C, or about 3 times more slowly than the Earth. Thus, carbon dioxide blocks the cooling radiation to space much more effectively than water vapour. Since the rate of energy input from the Sun has to equal the rate of energy output to space to keep the temperature constant, reducing the rate energy is emitted to space in these absorption bands causes the Earth temperature to rise. It is just that carbon dioxide is better at doing this than water vapour, and because its concentration continues to increase as we add it to the atmosphere, it has a greater greenhouse effect."},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"Most of us don’t get that lucky, to be able to bounce around to find our life’s purpose we are too busy, after moving out of our parents house, with all we own in our car then trying to make a stand in the world, to have a job we can pay our bills with then Mother Nature kicks in, and we get married and have kids then we are busy trying to pay our rent or mortgage, and other bills, and care for our kids.

Why would you want one anyway? Revolvers are kind of outdated. The biggest selling point of revolvers isn't their capacity anyway; it's their reliability. If you want to hold a lot of ammo get a semi-auto. Some newer 9mm carry pieces are compact enough for easy carry and still have a decent capacity. For example, the Sig 365 is a micro-compact 9mm and has a capacity of 10+1."},{"prompt":"Why do masons show up in a brother's funeral?

Now, suppose that all English….…. were to leave India, , then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations — the Mahomedans and the Hindus — could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other and thrust it down. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. At the same time you must remember that although the number of Mahomedans is less than that of the Hindus, and although they contain far fewer people who have received a high English education, yet they must not be thought insignificant or weak. Probably they would be by themselves enough to maintain their own position. But suppose they were not. [[38]] Then our Mussalman brothers, the Pathans, would come out as a swarm of locusts from their mountain valleys, and make rivers of blood to flow from their frontier in the north to the extreme end of Bengal. This thing — who, after the departure of the English, would be conquerors — would rest on the will of God. But until one nation had conquered the other and made it obedient, peace could not reign in the land. This conclusion is based on proofs so absolute that no one can deny it.

Americans hate mandates. If Congress passed a law making voting mandatory, presumably, they could do it by setting up a 500 fine or tax that people would have to pay if they didn’t vote in federal elections. The law would immediately be challenged in court by conservatives, who enjoy a 5–4 majority on the Supreme Court. The Court would split 5–4 in favor of declaring it unconstitutional. That’s the most likely scenario. The other issue is that this law would be so unpopular that the party proposing it would suffer at the polls in the next election."},{"prompt":"w do I get the test bank for “Managerial Accounting: Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment, Canadian Edition, 2nd Edition” by Hilton?","completion":"You must be careful, the trusted instant service be here: [LINKED_TEXT: test-bank-for-managerial-accounting-creating-value-in-a-dynamic-business-environment-canadian-edition-canadian-2nd-edition-by-hilton.pdf] [URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q3Sjo_VL7fPhLo6wf6TMoBIoPeOaQrlq/view?usp=sharing]Highly Recommend for Managerial Accounting Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment CANADIAN EDITION Canadian 2nd Edition Hilton Test Bank I downloaded both Solutions Manual/ Test Bank from them.

Let me break that down. At times when you choose something without being chosen, it puts you on a more offensive approach because you're being overly desire driven. We are all animals and it has been scientifically proven that some animals can smell certain scents. Desperation has a scent. It also manifests in a physiological reaction: sweat. Have you ever noticed how your body temp rises and you get sweat buildup and you can't seem to stop it? Well, that's what I'm referring to. That tends to happen when people are not sure about what's coming. Not being sure if someone likes you or how to get them to like you can do that. But, let me tell you one way to combat your frustration. I'd tell you to open yourself up to the various types of people out there. I know, you may like the eyes, nose, hair, muscles, brains, butt, voice, etc. There are so many variables that it can be comforting to simply find a small group of packaging that you appreciate. That way of thinking can lock into a bad habit of missing out on many wonderful types of partners that you could learn to like. Understand that this situation which is causing your disappointment is self imposed. You can create a new set of rules to update your view of your type. Trust me. Not everything that looks good to you is good for you. There are tons of people out there who've gotten what they thought wanted only to find themselves utter more disappointed with their newly acquired toy. People go and get new breast, butts, eyebrows, lips and any number of augmentations to appear more appealing to only find they end up without a partner or deeply disgusted with what they thought they wanted. There are too many stories in the naked city to support what I'm saying. Still, I know, you still want the big-muscled guy or the girl with the large butt and breasts or whatever combination. Happiness is only truly found within. No one person can deliver happiness to you. Sure there are things that can make you happy, but happy-NESS is already with you. But, let's say you want to settle for the superficial and get the temporary happy. Just know that what you pay for is what you get. There will come a time when that temporary happy runs out and you begin to question your decision. I broke things down, in this long-winded manner because I don't know your age and didn't know how much explanation you needed in one way or another. Plus, I'm a writer and words are my friends. I hope this started your mind to bubbling and gaining some valuable perspective on this important growth matter. Take care."},{"prompt":"What is dropshipping? Is it really profitable?","completion":"The other answers give a great definition of dropshipping. The only thing I would add is that there are a lot of affiliate marketing scams which depend upon it as a fulfillment means. Is it profitable? Maybe. It can also be a royal pain, and a low profit, high effort endeavor in which the business promoter gets a bunch of people like you to market their product at very low cost to them. The original dropshipping promoter was Amway. Lots of people made a lot of money off the concept. Subsequent waves of promoters have made good money too.

There are some elected members of the Republican Party who are genuine fiscal conservatives, but find that they do not have the support necessary in either party to enact actual spending restraint. Presidents Trump, Obama, and Bush II were/are not fiscal conservatives. All 3 Presidents loved to spend other peoples money. Republicans campaign on fiscal responsibility, but only very few like Rand Paul, Mark Meadows, and Thomas Massie believe in actually restraining or reducing federal spending. Constant fiscal profligacy, humongous government deficits, and government taking 20% of the productive economy wasn’t always the norm. This level of fiscal profligacy can directly be traced to policies and legislation that were adopted during the “progressive era” in American history. The primary culprits for this mess are Constitutional Amendments 16 and 17."},{"prompt":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","completion":"Nihari Gosht, a classic Muslim dish that originated in Mughal royal kitchens, has become more famous around the world.

Answer: -Yes, a TP4056 board can recharge a 3000 mAh Lithium Ion Cell (1S Single Cell) without a problem as long as it is connected to an input supply of 5 Volts. However, an important point to note is that the TP4056 should have an output voltage of between 4.1 Volts and 4.2 Volts. The majority of the samples of TP4056 boards that I have tested with my multimeter show an output of 4.16 Volts which is optimum for the 1S Lithium Ion single cell. If the voltage is between this prescribed limit, then you can proceed to connect the cell for charging. One more important fact is that the TP4056 has a current limiting resistor that limits the charging current of the battery to anywhere between 950 milli-Amperes to 1 Ampere and therefore the 3000mAh battery will take at least 4 hours to recharge to 100% when the TP4056 is connected."},{"prompt":"What causes the lawn mower to smoke?","completion":"depending if it is a 2 stroke or 4 stroke If it is a 2 stroke incorrect oil/ fuel ratio or incorrect oil used if it is a 4 stroke , can be worn riongs but more likely to be excessive oil in he sump generally that can be from a bad needle and seat that is allowing the fuel todrain into the sump raising the oil level top a point where the oil ring cannot control it Check the oil level and if it is too high , take it in for a carby rebuild also the wrong type of oil will make it smoke"},{"prompt":"Why did punk rock die?","completion":"No rock is popular anymore.

People don’t realize that the can be the best in their field but if they don’t have traffic and convert clients you aren’t any better than the Indian writer pumping out crap content at 1 per 1000 words. So how do you get clients? I’ll share three easy ways to get started right away. 1)Join Job Boards Job boards get a ton of flack on this site but I can tell you they are a great place to start. Job boards are filled with people looking for work and if you choose the right one they make sure a client has put money in escrow for the project before you start (no more finishing a project and waiting months to get paid). One thing people don’t understand is that most clients have zero experience vetting, finding, paying, and hiring freelancers. Job boards make it easy for you to reach a large portion of the market. The competition is big but it isn’t that great. If you write each proposal (no templates) and deliver high quality results you will find work! Great places to start: Upwork Problogger Freelancer 2)Network on social forums and FB groups Freelancers who started in the business three years ago or earlier have zero experience with real networking. Networking is huge. Networking lets you create social proof in front of the right people and leverage that for later work and referrals. You can get started networking for free by joining groups that need your services on: *LinkedIn *FB groups *Genre specific forums If you happen to be a specialist find where the people in your field congregate and go there, be of value, collect information and cold email! 3)Guest Post On Authority Blogs and Publication This last tip is a longer play. Guest posts are great ways to increase your exposure. You can use them for: *Project links to work you have done *To put your name in front of new people *Increase your social proof Pro-Tip:Guest posting works like compound interest. At first you’ll have zero traction. As your career progresses and your articles published grows so will your interest. Example:I guest posted a year ago on Sean Ogle’s site. Two months ago I recieved an email from someone who read it. They loved my writing and wanted me to write similar articles for their site. Now I didn’t write for Sean for this purpose. I wanted to grow my audience and give back to Sean who has helped me so much. Remember, guest posting builds social proof. The more social proof you collect the greater your ability to book projects with clients will be later. Final Tip Join my mailing list. Every week I put out epic content that teaches you how to: *Write proposals so good they get you booked *Create powerful relationships with clients to secure lasting income and get epic referrals *Master the key skills you need to double your hourly rate *And more!

A couple of big differences make the instruments distinct animals. When you play a key on the piano, the key is weighted and triggers a hammer to strike a string. There’s a sustain pedal, which the player can use to lift the dampers off the strings and let the sound resonate longer, but it eventually fades. Depending on how hard you play the key, the hammer strikes the string with more or less force, causing the string to play different volumes. So a piano allows for completely independent control of dynamics with every note you play. When you play a key on the organ, on the other hand, it’s unweighted and triggers a tone generator. This tone will sustain indefinitely for as long as you hold down the key, but there is no sustain pedal - to sustain you have to use your fingers. And since each key you play is triggering the same tone generator at the same volume, there is no difference in dynamics regardless of how hard you hit the key. Volume is controlled by a volume pedal, and your other foot is busy with the pedal board below which provides bass notes. So while they look visually similar, piano and organ have very different strengths. The piano can be played lyrically and/or percussively at any moment, thanks to a sustain pedal any number of notes can be held at once, and a good pianist can control dynamics via individual fingers. The organ’s superpower is the ability to sustain indefinitely, change timbre via draw bars or stops, light touch and the ability to easily slide from key to key, and ability to play three different ranges at once with your two hands and a foot. For the most part people can only get very good at one of these instruments in a lifetime, but there are exceptions - see Larry Goldings and Cory Henry to name just two."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"It is not possible to predict recession with certainty whether there will be a recession in the near future. Economic recessions are generally defined as a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for a prolonged period of time, and they are often characterized by high unemployment, reduced business activity, and declining asset prices. There are many factors that can influence the likelihood of a recession, including economic conditions, government policies, and global events. It is important to note that forecasting the future state of the economy is inherently uncertain, and even experts who study economic trends and patterns cannot predict with certainty whether or when a recession may occur. In general, it is always a good idea to be prepared for potential economic challenges and to have a plan in place to manage your finances and resources. This can help you to weather any potential economic downturns and to be in a better position to take advantage of opportunities when they arise."},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"Honesty: Genuine people are honest in their words and actions. They don’t pretend to be something they’re not or try to manipulate others. 2. Integrity: Genuine people have a strong sense of integrity and are guided by their moral compass. They are true to their values and beliefs. 3. Self-Awareness: Genuine people have a strong sense of self-awareness and are comfortable in their own skin.

Authenticity: Genuine people are authentic and genuine in their interactions. They are not afraid to show their true selves and be vulnerable. 6. Respect: Genuine people show respect to others and are courteous in their dealings. They treat everyone with dignity and kindness."},{"prompt":"Where is the best place to get help with credit card debt?","completion":"Benefits of Debt Settlement Over Options There are a few debt relief options you can choose from - paying on your own, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt settlement, and bankruptcy. Each option has their own pros and cons, but if you're leaning toward debt settlement, you may like what this solution has to offer. With debt settlement, your monthly payment is based on what you're able to pay. Payments under most of the other debt relief options are based on what your creditors will you to pay and they'll only go so low. If you're simply unable to make those minimum payments, debt settlement may be a better option since what you contribute toward your settlement payment is based on your budget. Note that some settlement companies want to settle your debt in a certain amount of time, so that may mean your monthly payments are set based on that time period. You can settle debts even if you're past due. As a matter of fact, your debts have to be delinquent before most creditors will accept a settlement offer. On the other hand, your accounts have to be current to go into a credit counseling agency's debt management plan. While you can consolidate past due debts, it may be hard to qualify for a low interest rate debt consolidation loan if you have negative payment history on your credit history. You'll save thousands of dollars on interest by settling your debts because you're settling your debts in just a few years, instead of paying on them for decades. If you were making the minimum payments on your debt, you could pay more than double your debt in interest alone. In settlement, you shave off all those years that you'd otherwise be paying interest. In addition, you would settle any interest that had already accumulated on your account. You can settle debts on your own or you can hire a debt settlement company, you choose based on what you're comfortable with. Other solutions require you to include a third-party - the credit counseling agency, a lender, or the bankruptcy court. Settling your own debts lets you avoid the middleman and avoid fees you pay to the debt settlement company. On the other hand, if you're not comfortable settling with creditors, you can hire a debt settlement company. It's great to have the freedom to choose. Debt settlement gives you a little breathing room, mainly because you've made a conscious decision to stop paying your creditors and instead focus on coming up with enough money to pay off a lump-sum portion of your balance. Once you decide to settle your debts, you can stop worrying about what you're going to do and instead start doing it. You don't have to worry about the impact to your credit, because, by choosing debt settlement, you've acknowledged that your credit takes a backseat for a few years until you've gotten the debt out of the way. Debt settlement has gotten a bad reputation from unscrupulous companies who took advantage of debtors. Fortunately, new federal law has almost eliminated these companies, making the benefits of debt settlement a lot more apparent.

First and foremost, it's crucial to understand the odds and the probability of winning. A successful bettor doesn't simply rely on luck; they have a thorough understanding of the sport they're betting on, including the team or athlete's past performance, injuries, and other factors that may affect the outcome. It's also important to set realistic expectations and manage your bankroll effectively. This means only betting a percentage of your total funds on any given bet, so as not to risk losing everything in one go. It's also helpful to track your bets and review your performance over time to identify areas for improvement and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you need help with your sports betting strategy, there are many resources available. Consider consulting with a professional handicapper or utilizing a sports betting platform like [COMPANY NAME] to access expert analysis, real-time odds, and other valuable tools to help you make informed bets and increase your chances of success.

Him: Bummer… you cool man. why this keep happening to you. me: i’m over qualified i guess. Him : okay, its fixable give it a last try. Take her to a horror movie. Maybe she will find you comforting during those jump scares. if not you can kiss her cheeks goodbye and say begone thot! there is plenty of fish in the sea. Me: I don't know, it isn't a bad idea though. Him : Take her at night for extra dramatic effect. me : I'm going to, yessssss…. him : yessssss. we both : lets talk about infinity war like we always do… (That’s our attention span. I know) *Transition* So, i persued her. Turns out she doesn't enjoy horror movies. Yeah i know red flag but she agreed and the date was set. I mean in my mind it was a date. So weekend came and on a rainy Sunday evening as the clock strikes 8. I picked her up from her flat and took her to the nearest pvr. On the way over she asked me if she can hold my hand? As a guy grew up on bollywood. i said “Why not?” so movie started and as well the jump scares begans. for some reason i didn’t found the movie as scary but the girl grabbed my hand and in my head i went like ‘here we go'. After few minutes i felt excrutiating pain in my left hand. The girl has nails sharper than chain saw. Although they were pretty all painted in black nail polish complementing her fair hands. But chain saw none of the less. ok here’s a thought i want to kill the person who said ‘men don’t feel pain'. i was literally shitting balls. Up till interval i decided to not give piece of my mind and to bring something to eat so she can’t grab my hand but noooo…. I got my hands busy but my fault i left my legs unsupervised she started digging her hands in my thighs slowly and as the movie got closer to climax. I can feel her nails getting closer to my bones toring my muscles. (Not literally but it felt like it) i couldn't take it anymore. I snapped and screamed “THE F#%, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME. I CAN’T FEEL MY HAND.

Don’t lose perspective This is tough there. When you enter Exeter, there’s a lot of kids who aspire to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, etc. Chances are, not all your friends are going to get into these schools, and sometimes people will think UC Berkley, UVirginia, or UMichigan, which are amazing university by anyone’s standards, are “the second tier” after Exeter. Try not to get into that mindset. You have gotten into one of the hardest high schools in the U.S., and keep that in mind when you are there. You’re at a school where there are a lot of people of high caliber and different interests, and at a place that you don’t get lectured but you learn yourself. THAT is probably one of the largest gifts there. Being in my second year of University, I miss that a lot. 2.) Be open about yourself You’re going to be with different people, some you may like, some you may not. Your parents are far away from you. Your grades will drop compared to before. Some friends are better at speaking/writing/debating/math/all compared to you. You're not the best anymore. And that’s fine, but don’t let that frustration bottle inside of you. You may read some Russian novels, and feel sad with each other, but it’s okay opening up to your friends about things that you don’t usually talk about or feelings that you consider trivial. Your thoughts matter, and when you find those who listen AND want to genuinely help you, that will be the best way to find a true friend. 3.) Have a growth mindset. Only compare yourself to your previous self. Nothing more than this. People will try to compare against you or you will have tendencies to compare yourself against other guys/gals who may have better writing skills, better looks, or more beautiful significant others than you. Heck, I never had a girlfriend until I was 20! You will feel pressured to do many different things, ranging from joining clubs to activities that will get you kicked out, and the best thing you can do is to compare yourself to your previous day and see if you have improved. Some of the smartest people had a fixed mindset, who everyone looked up to, yet whenever I talked to them I could tell that they were super insecure and anxious about being at the top. This is since they have a fixed mindset that they were always smart, were always gifted, so needed to do something to maintain an edge. That isn’t growing, but relying on previous gifts that have nothing to do with you. Good luck, and if there are any Exonians or future Exonians curious, I would highly recommend you keep this in your mind while you study there for the next 4, 3, 2, 1 year(s)."},{"prompt":"Why is Prince Andrew 'vocal' with the Queen that Charles 'shouldn't be King'?","completion":"I imagine there is some jealousy.

The iPhone 11 is a largely unexciting update, it will sell well regardless. That's Apple fans for you.

A well-made one is hard to find in India, so if the Rosetta Stone is spotted, it is inevitable that there’s going to be moss and cheese around my lips and on my shirt. Pringles sour cream and onion flavoured crisps I attack a cylinder of Pringles stack-by-stack and each stack includes 7–10 crisps, so civilization is impossible in the air around me while I grind those to oblivion. Spinach and ricotta cannelloni The consequences are a bit similar to those pertaining to calzone attacks. The last time I binged on cannelloni was when I roomed with family at Clarks Avadh in Lucknow for a few days in 2018. I included daily breakfast and dinner as part of the booking, and my blood sugar levels were close to 700 (699) at the end at least as a result of cannellonis being part of all (buffet) meals. The common link to all of these is gluttony, the most innocent of all the SDS, so the possibility of converting any contact with civilized food into an Obelix and a wild boar event is significant enough. When I was a kid, snacks wouldn’t last even an hour after my father’s arrival with a box of any of them. Once my father took his young children to his friend’s abode in a hill station — beautiful Attakatti near Coimbatore. The friend served us coffee (probably Bournvita for the kids; I was about five years old and my brother seven then) and brought two large plates of mixture to be snacked on (by all!) between sips of coffee. My brother and I assigned ourselves a plate each and proceeded to empty everything on it. The friend was tottering on the edge of ruin.

I got to the door and the man in question took the pizza (took it from me but was not handed it) claimed the pizzas were being comped by the manager. As per company policy in any situation where things don't seem right I called my manager to confirm this and he said this was untrue, and that the address had been difficult in the past. I relayed this to the customer who then proceeded to take the phone from my hands and begin speaking in hushed tones I could not quite make out. What I didn't know was that he was threatening to not return my phone or even let me leave unless the pizza was given free. In situations like this it was common (although pretty foolish in hindsight but that's managerial decision-making for you) in our shop to send out other drivers to assist the one in trouble, usually either those who are nearby or, if there are none, the biggest and meanest looking ones in the store and this is what happened. Along with this the police were notified as one would expect. Through some careful diplomacy I managed to convince the man to return my phone so I could speak to my manager and after he did I hear one word from the speaker: “run”. Apparently the customer had a history of violent behaviour we were unaware of. Being a slender, quick-footed person and a good if speedy driver I managed to get out okay before help had arrived (they were called off before they could be in danger). Easily one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of the last few years. So long story short pizza delivery shops, at least where I live in Scotland, will initially try to talk sense into the person and if this seems unlikely to work they will immediately treat it like any other theft and report it whilst simultaneously prepare against the worst and get the deliverer the hell out of there. The address and phone number will then be permanently blacklisted If someone is willing to casually break one law you can't simply assume they won't break others. They may not but it's not worth the risk for a £10 pizza."},{"prompt":"Who is headless CMS for?","completion":"Until recently, developing an integrated website was sufficient as a content delivery tool. But nowadays the variety of modern gadgets has changed the number of interaction channels between customers and companies. Each of these channels needs to be addressed differently, both from a technical and content point of view. Therefore, digital companies are beginning to realize that the concept of traditional content management systems is no longer so relevant. That’s because a traditional CMS turned out to be too limiting in the new multichannel world. The constraints that have arisen and the need for a more engaging digital experience across all touchpoints, like websites, mobile apps, smart devices, have prompted organizations to invent a better alternative - a headless CMS. Do I need a headless CMS? The answer to this question is quite simple, but it won’t help you much: It depends on your requirements. The term headless means that the “head” (the frontend of your application) becomes decoupled from the body (the backend). Unlike traditional content management systems, a headless CMS is only concerned with storing data. It exposes this data to the outside world, usually via an API, which introduces many great benefits, for example: Device versatilityTechnological flexibilityGreat content management experienceImproved security You can learn more in our article: [LINKED_TEXT: Headless CMS: The Benefits of Being \\"Headless\\" - Unikorns] [URL: https://www.unikorns.work/magazine/headless-cms-the-benefits-of-being-headless]"},{"prompt":"What are some ways I can attach both large and small vertical cardboard tubes to flat horizontal platforms when constructing a homemade multilevel cat tree?","completion":"I would consider atttaching round wood components to the base first.

And what is the definition of a person? As for the philosophic question of when a human being can be considered a person or lose their personhood, the application is very fuzzy and arbitrary. By the same standards we might deny personhood to an embryo we would remove personhood from a human who is sleeping, unconscious, in a coma, in a vegetative state… of no functional use to society. If a human in a state of coma is a person because they have the potential to become an autonomous individual…. would that not apply to a zygote?"},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"It really depends on why you are looking at leasing a car. In some circumstances it can be better to lease than buy. Some leases can improve your credit rating. So this means you will pay less per month, while building your credit. Yes you pay for the car's depreciation, but your credit should improve allowing you to buy a car at the end of the lease with a lower interest rate. This can also be helpful with some unexpected life events where you need a newer/bigger/etc. car that you weren't able to plan ahead for. It allows you a car to use, while getting you used to paying for a car, and making sure you have a dependable car until your life/finances level out. I have known several people that have leased for the credit boosting or life changes reasons. They entered into it knowing that it may not be the ideal option, but it was the best option for them and their situation at the time. You need to assess why you are leasing, and look at the costs vs. buying. Then decide what makes the most sense to you and for your lifestyle/income."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"When it comes to meal prep, sometimes you simply want convenience. That's why microwave meals are so popular. Now, you may realize that some microwave meals are unhealthy options but do you realize that even microwave meals that claim to be healthy can be bad for your health? It's true! Here's what you need to know about microwave meals and how they can have a negative impact on your health. Blood Pressure Issues That microwave meal that advertises it's low in calories? Well, that information is not telling the whole story. Many microwave meals may be low in the calories department but high in things that aren't good for you, such as salt. Too much salt, as well as other preservatives, can have a negative impact on your blood pressure and lead to problems with your cardiovascular system down the road. Most people need about 2,400 mg of sodium each day to stay healthy. If you're getting more than that, then it's time to rethink what you're eating. Water Retention Another issue that you can experience if you eat too many microwave meals too frequently is water retention. The salt contained in the meals will actually make you less thirsty and have an impact on your water intake. That's because the retention of fluid tricks your body into thinking it has enough water -- when it really doesn't. Not drinking enough water each day can have a huge impact on your overall health and wellness. Beware of Food Poisoning Microwaving is usually a safe way to prepare foods, but food still needs to be cooked to a certain temperature in order to make it safe for consumption. Microwaves tend to unevenly heat food and may not get it to the temperature required on the box. If it doesn't, then that can put you at risk for food poisoning. Unhealthy Body Weight Convenience foods often found in the microwave meal section of the grocery store are not known for helping you to achieve or maintain a healthy body weight. Eating prepared and processed foods, such as microwave meals, can pack on pounds. So, beware of foods from the microwave -- even if the packaging makes them sound healthy. If it's prepackaged and processed, It's not doing your health any favors."},{"prompt":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","completion":"What would be your one wish if a genie came out of a bottle? “I wish that any cockroaches that come within 1km of me would immediately die and stay dead.” No selfish want of money or power, no altruistic crap like world peace or empathy.

Set in a real courthouse, Jury Duty incorporates workplace comedy into a real crime documentary that’s actually a hidden camera show. The series Jury Duty focuses on the civilian Ronald Gladden, surrounded by incredible up-and-coming actors and famous faces such as James Marsden (Dead to Me). It depicts an unsuspecting jury immersed in a fictitious case. An arguably impressively ambitious concept, Jury Duty succeeded almost entirely thanks to Gladden’s earnestness. Creators: Lee Eisenberg, Gene Stupnitsky Cast: James Marsden, Alan Barinholtz, Ronald Gladden, Susan Berger Peaky Blinders (2013-2022) After the Great War in 1919, Britain was a mixture of despondency and hedonism.

The Diplomat (2023) Keri Russell (“The Americans”) stars in “The Diplomat,” a hard-hitting political thriller that follows the life of the new U.S. ambassador to Britain. “The Diplomat” deftly marries the personal and the political, with an eight-episode first season that piles on tension and enthralls Russell as Kate Wyler. While The Diplomat is sometimes overshadowed by political issues, its equally interesting when Kate confronts demanding husband, her fellow diplomat and up-and-coming political star played by Rufus Sewell.

US gun owners believe that gun regulations when targeted at persons who are a threat such as psychotic individuals and violent criminals are a good thing. Especially, when they are actually enforced. Most gun regulations target nonviolent and non-psychotic individuals. They target law abiding people who use firearms to protect their life, family and property 2 million time per year. The California and federal laws failed to protect the citizens of Sacramento this past weekend. During that event at least one fully automatic weapon was used. (Based on Audio) If the weapon is ever recovered It will probably have been smuggled into the US. Probably through Mexico. Dandrae Martin the first person arrested in the Sacramento Ca shooting has a long history of criminal conduct. He under current law is prohibited from possessing a firearm. His convictions include false imprisonment, assault, (involved sex trafficking) drug dealing (felony). and parole violations for a number of other convictions. Yet he is being charged for possession of an illegal weapon. Note that he is not charged for violation of being a prohibited person in possession. He is the poster child for the person whom gunowners believe should be prevented from having firearms. He is also an example of lax enforcement of existing firearms law. In locations where violent criminals are targeted for weapons violations and receive long sentences in prison (See operation Exile-Richmond VA) Violence declines. Murders drop.

When implemented effectively, social media marketing can have a positive impact on your brand, customer engagement, lead generation, and overall business growth. Here are some ways social media marketing can benefit your business: 1. Increased Brand Awareness: Social media platforms have billions of active users, providing an opportunity to expose your brand to a vast audience. Regularly posting engaging content and interacting with users can significantly increase your brand's visibility and recognition. 2. Improved Customer Engagement: Social media allows direct communication with your audience. Engaging with customers through comments, messages, and posts helps build stronger relationships, fosters loyalty, and creates a sense of community around your brand. 3. Targeted Advertising: Social media platforms offer sophisticated targeting options to reach specific demographics, interests, behaviors, and locations. This allows you to focus your marketing efforts on the most relevant audience, increasing the chances of conversion. 4. Lead Generation: Social media can be a powerful tool for lead generation. By providing valuable content and using lead generation forms or landing pages, you can capture user information and turn social media followers into potential customers. 5. Website Traffic: Sharing links to your website or blog on social media can drive traffic to your online assets. The more relevant and engaging your content, the more likely users are to visit your website and explore your offerings. 6. Brand Authority and Thought Leadership: Consistently sharing valuable and insightful content can establish your brand as an authority and thought leader in your industry. This helps build trust with your audience and positions your business as a credible source. 7. Customer Feedback and Market Research: Social media provides a platform for customers to give feedback, share opinions, and voice concerns. This real-time feedback can be invaluable for understanding customer needs and preferences, helping you improve products and services. 8. Competitive Advantage: Having an active and engaging presence on social media can give you a competitive edge. Businesses that effectively leverage social media are more likely to attract customers and outperform competitors who neglect their online presence. 9. Cost-Effectiveness: Social media marketing can be more cost-effective than traditional advertising channels. Many social media platforms offer affordable advertising options, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes. 10. Measurable Results: Social media platforms provide detailed analytics and insights, allowing you to measure the performance of your campaigns and make data-driven decisions for future strategies. While social media marketing offers significant benefits, it's essential to have a well-thought-out strategy and be consistent in your efforts. Understanding your target audience, choosing the right platforms, and providing valuable content are key factors in achieving success through social media marketing."},{"prompt":"Why is Don Lemon not released from CNN while Megyn Kelly was released from NBC for saying much less?","completion":"She was bad for ratings and advertisers.

So while Johnny Rotten was slumming around London with a ““I hate Pink Floyd” shirt, Pink Floyd’s records were selling by millions while punk bands seemed to take pride in the fact that they were basically destitute, and unpopular. While punk was mostly known in the UK, it was even more underground in the USA. No major chain record store carried the records, and radio AirPlay was non existent. Often times our punk collection was mostly cassette copies that had been traded around, it didn’t bother us that we would never hear ““Holiday In Cambodia” on the radio, or that we couldn’t find The Germs at the local Tower Records, because it was cool to have something underground that left your Foreigner loving friends shaking there heads in disbelief that I would listen to such garbage, but before long they would be listening too.

Is this true?","completion":"Hahaha, no. Your conservative relative is misinformed. While there are certainly good reasons to not like Hillary Clinton, the risk that she’d foist socialism upon the country isn’t one of them. Even if she could as president (she can’t, no president can), she wouldn’t. Clinton’s track record isn’t that of a socialist of any stripe. Instead, she’s proven herself pliant and friendly to corporate interests, all for bailing out banks and keeping them deregulated, for trade agreements that put corporate interests ahead of sovereignty or the public good. (It’s better-explained here: [[LINKED_TEXT: Bernie Sanders Vs Hillary Clinton: Comparing Neoliberalism To Democratic Socialism On Issues] [URL: http://www.inquisitr.com/3174833/bernie-sanders-vs-hillary-clinton-comparing-neoliberalism-to-democratic-socialism-on-issues/]]) For context, socialism is a spectrum of political/economic organization, which ranges all the way from state-ownership-of-industry to we’re-still-capitalists-but-regulate-markets-in-the-public-interest. Clinton lands somewhere well off the spectrum, way over in neoliberal-corporatist-land, where instead of wanting government to check corporate abuse, they see the proper role of government in service of big business (or apparently, in service of folks who can afford high-powered lobbyists). For all that conservatives are constantly assured that democrats like Clinton (and Obama, for that matter) are secret socialists, that’s just propaganda to keep them riled up. The truth is a bit worse; establishment Democrats since the Reagan era have been of the same neoliberal stripe; they might be liberal on social policy (like women’s rights and marriage equality) but in economic terms they’ve internalized as correct the sense that the government’s role should be to strengthen corporate hands in terms of suppressing organized labor, keeping wages low, exploiting foreign labor and resources, and outsourcing public functions (like prisons and schools and warfare) to private interests. In this sense, Clinton might as well be a Republican- they like all the same things, in terms of economics, corporate welfare, trade policy, and keeping bank regulators toothless. But they’re going to stoke up the socialism propaganda to keep your attention focused on that stuff. This is all kinda fascinating to watch, in the sense that so much of America’s success is so closely related to where it’s cultivated public wealth, assets, infrastructure, and safety nets. Part of America’s success is connected to such socialist undertakings as Social Security, Medicare, Interstates (gasp, freeways instead of tollways?), ports, the military, your fire department, police, and all the other common infra/services that enable so much more. To watch us use Socialism like a political boogeyman when we use so much of it (as though we didn’t) is at least a little entertaining."},{"prompt":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","completion":"9 Good Protein Source for vegetarians to avoid Protein Deficiency Food and drink should be taken special care to stay healthy.

She was the best flying of all fifty Blackbirds and just loved to fly fast. While assigned to Site II at Palmdale for flight test, test pilot Bill Weaver and his back seater took it 974 out for a test run after some major work was completed. Having completed their test card, and with ample fuel on board, Bill radioed back to Site II to ask permission to run the SR out to the end of its performance envelope. On this particular test run, the weather and temperature at 80,000 feet was perfect; 974 was the best flying of all the Blackbirds and Bill received the okay to run her out. At Mach 3.43, or just around 2,400 mph, 974 had a duel unstart. Both Bill and his back seater thought the SR was in the process of disintegrating around them. Bill indicated that he thought his back seater may have messed his shorts. That didn’t happen, and they were able to recover 974 and to bring her home, a little shaken, but other wise okay. Hope that answers your question. And SR-71A, 974 was okay to fly the next day.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"A lot of the answer is: it depends on the vet. Also, you, as the caretaker of the cat, are the only one who can really make this decision. The hardest call to make, in my opinion, is to decide to put down a cat who is not actively sick, but whose quality of life has deteriorated. Here are some things to consider: Has the cat's quality of life deteriorated? Will the cat need care that you can't, or can't afford to, provide? Does the cat need treatment that will be painful, and will the cat understand why it's suffering? (Probably not…cats can't understand how something like chemotherapy feels bad, but will ultimately help.) Can the cat be cured? How old is the cat? Is the cat happy, or is it miserable? Could the cat be rehomed?"},{"prompt":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","completion":"I was always out of opinion for this topic. I heard people say it creates pollution and should be banned, I thought oh yes it does we must not fire the crackers. Then there were arguments saying people fire crackers in marriages and in cricket wins and on many other occasions other than Diwali. I thought oh yes it must be permanently banned for everyone. Somewhere I heard, there are so many factories and vehicles and gadgets that creates so much pollution, Crackers are insignificant in front of the pollution they create on a daily basis. I thought yeah that’s correct, we must not target only crackers for pollution. And there were many more, some in favor and some against. Then yesterday, I read something said by Sadhguru “Concern about air pollution is not a reason to prevent kids from experiencing the joy of firecrackers. As your sacrifice for them, walk to your office for three days. Let them have the fun of bursting crackers.” And I said oh yeah that is so good. I felt happy for this middle way to enjoy bursting crackers. None of the above written stuff convinced me fully to have my own opinion. It is Diwali today. I went upstairs to see the lightning all around my place, and what I saw was nothing but smog all around. White dusty air. I came back in exactly 3 minutes. and now as I am writing this answer, I can feel something is wrong with my throat. and this happened in exactly 3 minutes. This somehow gave me an opinion of my own. It is less about bursting crackers on Diwali, or on other occasion, but more about the quantity in which they are burst in one go. So many people are out there defending crackers by comparing them saying they create less pollution than factories and vehicles and all other stuff. Many people are there who fight with others to not burst crackers, but then there are so many people ( most of them young kids or youngsters) for whom Diwali has no meaning other than enjoying crackers. So the question remains where it was, should we burst crackers or not? My answer is- If you enjoy bursting crackers, go ahead and have fun without feeling guilty. If you do not like crackers or if you have learnt other ways to enjoy Diwali which does not include crackers, that is best. Enjoy Diwali your way to the fullest, without making anyone feel guilty about bursting crackers. Let us not forget Diwali is a FESTIVAL which is meant to enjoy. Let us also not forget that we live in nature which is already polluted and crackers create pollution(noise and air both). Let us find a middle ground just like Sadhguru suggested. Instead of mocking the practice of bursting crackers and those who burst crackers, let us do our bit to reduce pollution in our daily lives so that when we burst crackers it is little less harmful. Instead of saying no to crackers, let us teach kids about what crackers do to environment and how does the noise of crackers bother animals. If kids know about the side effects, they may choose willingly not to burst crackers and find other ways to enjoy Diwali (This worked for me and my brother, we did not understood pollution when we were little, but when we got to know about animals, we completely stopped crackers). Instead of taking the ban of crackers on religion or on Diwali, let us look at our environment and think mindfully and maybe burst little less crackers if we can’t stop totally. let us do our part in every little way we can and not fight for a straight answer of yes and no. since my throat is not feeling good, I am stopping here.

You could pick a public key with much higher hamming weight, but why would you - all it would do is make the maths harder. It also means signature verification is cheaper than signature creation. Symmetric keys take the same effort for encryption and decryption. In counter mode the operation is in fact identical. In Diffie Hellman operations are equivalent. So in El-Gamal and Integrated Encryption schemes, encryption and decryption are equivalent. In Elliptic Curve schemes the private key operation (signature) is cheaper than the public key operation (verification) but we tend to use ECDH to set up an IES so again operations are equivalent."},{"prompt":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","completion":"Understand the reason behind your son's interest in music: Before trying to stop your son from making music, it's important to understand why he enjoys it.

Have an open and honest conversation with your son: It's important to communicate with your son in a calm and respectful manner. Share your concerns with him and listen to his perspective. Together, you can come up with a compromise or a way to address your concerns.

You can also set clear boundaries and limits on when he can make music. Seek professional help if necessary: If you're concerned that your son's passion for music is negatively impacting his mental or physical health, it's important to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance on how to address the situation.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","completion":"The NHS runs routine screening for some cancers- cervical, colon, prostate and breast cancer from memory. People considered at sufficient risk from these will be invited for relevant checks on a regular basis - how often that is depends on the cancer being screened for, and risk factors. So a woman with a strong family history of breast cancer will start getting screened earlier, and more often than one with no family history of it. If you have no symptoms or other cause for concern, a NHS GP is unlikely to arrange for checks that serve no real purpose. But if a man has family history etc that suggest a strong risk of prostate cancer, a GP would probably deem that sufficient cause to do a simple PSA test earlier than normal, if the patient asks. The simpler, quicker and cheaper the test, the more likely a GP is to agree to it with little justification."},{"prompt":"Which is the best position to sit in for studying?","completion":"Definitely ergonomic chairs are better than wooden and plastic chairs. But for buying ergonomic chairs there are many brands. After searching many websites i found “FEATHERLITE” chairs which is the best branded company for chairs and furniture's. A few important feature of chairs for studying longer duration are… Height must be adjustable, so that we can sit at convenient height at the table.Leaning tension on back support must be adjustable. Also the height of hand rests must be adjustable.The most important feature of chairs for studying longer duration is “The back support should be straight i.e., the angle between back support and chair should be 90°”. So the chairs which have back support way too back and the chairs like in barber shop should never be used for studying.Also one more important thing to keep in mind when buying table and chair for studying is to ensure that the minimum height of the chair upto handrest should be less than the height of the table studying area. There are many types of chairs in FEATHERLITE, but i brought “Featherlite Contact Project High Back Desk Arm Chair (Black)” which was quite amazing. There are better chairs available in this brand than this one, but those weren't deliverable to my location so i brought this. Initially I thought the back support wasn't sturdy but after watching demo video on YouTube i found it was sturdy and it actually was sturdy. Price might be a little high but rather buying chair's at low prices of cheap quality which are going to eventually get damaged buying this type of best branded company chairs is better.

It's like fine-tuning your website to make it more search engine friendly and user-friendly at the same time. You see, search engines like Google, Bing, and others use complex algorithms to determine which websites to show in their search results.

They were often referred to as Cafsa or Capsians; a group of people not devoid of negroid characteristics according to Jehan Desanges a French historian, philologist and epigrapher, a specialist of North Africa during Antiquity. A member of the [LINKED_TEXT: Institute for Advanced Study] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study] in [LINKED_TEXT: Princeton] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey][1](11) Wyatt MacGaffey, Professor of Anthropology, Haverford College, Pennsylvania claims that the term “Mediterranean” is an anthropological euphemism for “Negro”. B.B. Lal (Braj Basi Lal, better known as B. B. Lal, is an Indian archaeologist. He was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1968 to 1972 and has served as Director of the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla.)has shown conclusively that the Dravidians (original east Indians); (southern India), came from Nubia and were related to the C-Group people who founded the Kerma dynasty.(3) The Sudanese Dravidians / Ethiopian Indians Africa extended into what is now called India. The Dravidians or original peoples sometimes referred to as Dalits are Ethiopians / Africans. The term Dalits means Bound and the name may have been given to them by those who enslaved them and put them in a racist caste system at the lowest levels. the Dalits or Dravidians were the indigenous peoples of India or the Eastern Ethiopians or Eastern Africans. \\"The distinction between the black-skinned Sudroid races of southern India and the fair-skinned Aryan races of northern India is not an invention of English colonialist historians; it is a feature mentioned by the earliest Greek travelers who visited south Asia centuries before the advent of Robert Clive. The ancient Greeks considered the Africans and Sudras (modern Dalits and Dravidians) as belonging to the same \`Ethiopian' stock. \`Ethiopian' was the Greek word for \`Negro', and Greek authors referred to the African Negroes as \`Western Ethiopians' and to the Sudroids as \`Eastern Ethiopians' (ie. Eastern Negroes) [ cf. [LINKED_TEXT: http://Herodotus.VI] [URL: http://herodotus.vi/].70 ]the majority Witness the following citation from Herodotus - \\" The Eastern Ethiopians, [ ie. Sudras ] differed in nothing from the other Ethiopians, same in their language, and the character of their hair. For the Eastern Ethiopians have straight hair, while they of Libya are more woolly-haired than any other people in the world. \\" Beyond the gulf of Baraca is that of Barygaza and the coast of the country of Ariaca, which is the beginning of the Kingdom of Nambanus and of all India. \\"That part of it lying inland and adjoining Scythia is called Abiria, but the coast is called Syrastrene. It is a fertile country, yielding wheat and rice and sesame oil and clarified butter, cotton and the Indian cloths made there from, of the coarser sorts. Very many cattle are pastured there, and the men are of great stature and black in color. The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the expedition of Alexander, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells. The sailing course along this coast, from Barbaricum to the promontory called Papica opposite Barygaza, and before Astacampra, is of three thousand stadia. \\"Periplus.41 The Makran was referred to by the Greeks as \`Gedrosia', ie. the land of the black people. Black Sudroids form a sizeable portion of the population in this region to this day, and formed one of the groups referred to as \`East Ethiopians' [ Kondratov, p.145 ]. Indeed, several geographers considered India merely another extension of Ethiopia or Abyssinia -India as a whole originates from the north, embraces all the area which is Persian, and continues as far as Egypt and the lands of Ethiopia. \\" The Caste system was instituted by the ruling Aryan class that invaded India. Here are some comments on that history: \\"The Dravidians entered India before the Aryans, before 2000 B.C., after passing through Mesopotamia, Iran, and Baluchistan where the Brahuis, a Dravidian race, still live. On grounds of cultural affinities such as inheritance through women, snake cults, organization of society, and structure of temples, some historians connect the Dravidians with the Elamites and Mesopotamians. The evidence of Indian skulls from the Indus Valley indicates that the Mediterranean stock became established in north India before the Harappab Civilization came into existence around 2000 B.C.\\" \\"Of particular significance is archeologist B. B. Lal's contention that the Dravidians probably came from Nubia, Upper Egypt. This theory would give them among other things their Mediterranean features and dark complexion. Lal writes: \\"At Timos the Indian team dug up several megalithic sites of ancient Nubians which bear an uncanny resemblance to the cemeteries of early Dravidians which are found all over Western India from Kathiawar to Cape Comorin. The intriguing similarity extends from the subterranean structure found near them. Even the earthenware ring-stands used by the Dravidians and Nubians to hold pots were identical.\\" According to Lal, the Nubian megaliths date from around 1000 B.C.\\" \\"Distorted Race Theory\\" The term \\"distorted race theory\\" in application to the Dravidian movement, which is compared to Nazism and Hindutva. The latest genetic research, which conclusively proves that the Dravidians and Dalits belong to the same Negroid stock. The poisonous casteism, which the Indian iconoclasts suffering from, is entirely Aryan and Brahmanic origin. Historians have conclusively established that caste did not exist in the pre-Aryan age. It was introduced by racist color-conscious Aryan invaders who wished to \\"maintain their racial purity\\" from \\"contamination\\" with native Dravidians. During the Harappan Golden Age, that the Dravidians and Dalits existed as one people, known as \`Sudras'. The division between Dravidians and Adi-Dravidians is purely artificial and the result of Aryan invasions, with the former choosing to adopting Aryan culture and submit as slaves to the Aryans and the latter battling the savage Aryans, retaining their freedom in the jungles. Adi-Dravida means - \`Original Dravidian'. Dravida is of Sanskrit origin and the term \`Sudra' and \`Adi-Sudra' are now more in vogue for this very reason. The word \`Sudra' is attested from the Vedic Dark Ages, and this word is of African origin, whilst the terms \`Dravida' and \`Dalit' are much later innovations. The following diagram shows how the Dravidian word \`Sudra' is in fact derived from \`Sudan' : Sudan --> Sudra (Central Africa) (Black Indian Caste) Sanskrit The word 'Hindu' has its origin in Sanskrit literature. In the Rig Veda, India was referred to as the country of'Sapta Sindhu', i.e. the country of seven great rivers. The word 'Sindhu' refers to rivers and sea and not merely to the specific river called the Sindhu (Indus), now in Pakistan. In Vedic Sanskrit, according to ancient dictionaries, 'sa' was pronounced as 'ha'. Thus 'Sapta Sindhu' was pronounced as 'Hapta Hindu'; similarly 'Saraswati' was pronounced as 'Haravyati' or 'Harahwati'. This is how the word 'Hindu' came into being. The ancient Persians also referred to India as 'Hapta Hind', as recorded in their ancient classic 'Bern Riyadh'. That is why some scholars came to believe that the word 'Hindu' had its origin in Persia. The Greeks who invaded India under Alexander the Great, dropped the 'H' completely and used the name Indoos or Indus which later led to the formation of the word 'India'."},{"prompt":"w do snow plows know where the edge of the road is and not run off?","completion":"The easy and most accurate answer is “experience”. Experience helps the driver learn the details of his plow route. He or she may not know exactly where he is along the road, but he probably will recognize features along the route. Trees, rocks, mailboxes, signs, houses etc. They drive this route once every two to three hours while plowing in a snowstorm. You can walk from your bedroom to the kitchen with your eyes closed. Our drivers have a pretty good idea where they are on their 8 to 15-mile plow route. Some drivers are lucky enough to have delineators along the edge of the highway, likely about 4 feet off the edge of the pavement. They are usually placed along the both sides of Interstates and other major highways. Fun fact: In NH, the roadside delineators, which are 4” x 6” silver reflectors set 4 feet above the edge of pavement, are placed 20 per mile, or one every 256 feet. [5280/20=-20. Sometimes all a driver can do is try to see the next reflector through the snow or fog. Part B of the question is where the plow is laterally (left and right) driving along the road. Again, experience. They can sometimes see or sense if they are too far to one side or the other. If it is daylight, they might see a piece of paint centerline in their mirror. Maybe there are embankments near the road, or mailboxes, utility poles or fences that will keep them on the road. Runs of guardrail are an obvious target. They may not know exactly where they are, but they usually have a pretty good idea."},{"prompt":"Abe Lincoln was a self taught lawyer.

Get a book out to read, start storytime for the dolls. If young Miss is hanging about to enjoy the story, close the book and remind her that storytime is for those that have brushed teeth and changed into pajamas. Reassure her that you will hold storytime a few minutes if she should like to get ready.Ask the children if there is a volunteer to unload the dishwasher, wait.

Inoculations are Not Just for Physical Diseases: Sometime shortly before age 10, sooner for some, sit them down for a short talk about how things will change for them in the next few years. Not that whole weird puberty talk that makes everyone just a little uncomfortable, but a quick rundown of how the very way they think of events will change. They will know that all of the rules you give them are because you don't want them to have friends, because you're trying to ruin their lives, and because you hate them. They will know that nobody else in history has ever felt as intensely as they do about… whatever it is… and adults couldn't possibly understand. Let them know that this is a perfectly normal way to feel, but it is wrong; the teen brain simply lies about what it experiences.Let them know that they may be at a party someday and have a chance to try some alcohol. They may decide that it feels good, and their brain will tell them that more alcohol will mean more fun… Sometimes, your brain lies to you.

The founders were arrested and tried in Sweden, not the U.S. (But they did help investigate, rumors suggest.) But you say “websites like the Pirate Bay”. The internet is a bunch of physical cables and servers. In order to actually get data from a server, your computer has to go through these to reach fixed locations that have the data you want to download. You can obfuscate your end as a torrent user quite a bit, weaving a path through countless gimmicks, like VPNs. But the actual data store has to have a fixed and known digital location. And by asking the owners of the infrastructure the routing they used to get to a fixed IP address, it is possible to physically trace back to the location of the piracy website. It does require warrants to get that information from internet backbone companies and ISPs. And that final line from the ISP’s box to the actual location of the servers is controlled by the server owner, so can be another step in obfuscation. But one foiled by a technician just walking the cable line to your facility.

If you are the owner of the mobile phone number, you can usually access your own call history by going into your phone's settings or calling your mobile carrier's customer service line. The exact process for accessing your call history may vary depending on your phone and carrier, so it's best to check with your carrier's customer service for instructions. If you are trying to access the call history of someone else's mobile phone number, it becomes more complicated. In most cases, you would need a court order or a warrant to access someone else's call history. It is illegal to access someone else's call history without their permission or without a legal justification. It's also worth noting that some mobile carriers may not keep call records for an extended period of time, so the availability of call history records may vary depending on the carrier and the timeframe you are looking for.

Not even a little bit. Remember the Facebook phone? No? Well they made a phone. Because they thought people would buy it. Spoiler: they didn’t. People hate Facebook. They use it because they have to. They use it because they’re used to it and it exists. They don't want to let Facebook more into their lives. Plus Facebook makes crappy hardware. Like terrible. Horrible. The Occulus is an exception but they bought that. No, they’re not going to give the Apple Watch a run for it’s money. They won’t even give the minuscule other smartwatches that barely succeed a run for their money. The Meta Watch will flop like a lead balloon that someone threw a baseball through (see video). Facebook’s Meta might succeed. I give it less than even odds, especially considering how much everyone hates Facebook, but of all their products that will definitely not succeed, this will be one of them. If the Facebook Meta Watch ever comes even close to meeting Apple’s Apple Watch numbers, I’ll shave my eyebrows. It’s like asking if Nokia made a car if it would give Tesla a run for its money.

If these conditions are fulfilled in every point of an interval [a,b], then f is continuous over that interval. Then, one can build using continuous functions. If f and g are continuous over [a,b], the so are f+g, f-g, fg, f/g (when g is not zero), and f(g) (composition) over that interval. For instance, y = sin(x^2)+ln(x) is continuous over its domain x>0 because x^2, ln(x), and sin(x) are. A very useful theorem using derivatives: If f is differentiable over [a,b], then it is continuous there. I.e., if f ‘(x) exists at every point in [a,b], then f is continuous there. For instance, since d tan(x)/dx = (sec(x))^2, which exists over (-pi/2 , pi/2), then y = tan(x) is continuous there."},{"prompt":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","completion":"I just thought of an online business: most cities have less than 40 skyscrapers.

Claiming ignorance does not, for the most part, play out well in legal situations. You made a mistake, and your best bet is to admit it and accept the consequences. If you go to court and do that, you may get lucky and get a reduced fine. If you try and argue it, or take it to a jury trial, you'll likely end up with the maximum penalty. For future reference, fire hydrants can be a variety of colors, and you can't park in front of any of them at any time. I've seen red, yellow, white, and blue.

Is this true?","completion":"I don’t know what the “Hidden Bible Code” is that you referenced, but I do know what God’s word says, and in speaking of the rapture, Jesus said in Matthew 24:36- “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” There is more to it than that, but the rapture is always described as a “surprise” event. Jesus comes as a “thief in the night” in 1 Thes. 5:2, and although we are also told in that same chapter that we are not “in the dark” and will not be “caught unaware”, we can’t know the day or the hour. Could he have revealed the “year” of the rapture in His word? Of course He could have! The year is not the day or the hour, and He revealed the very day that Christ would enter Jerusalem at Passover in Daniel 9, so, again, of course He could. God knows the end from the beginning so anything is possible. But, again, I don’t know anything about the book so I can’t vouch for it. So, is the rapture in 2021? Personally, I think there is an outstanding chance that it is because we can see the shadow of many of the tribulation judgments looming over us now, and none of the prophecies from Revelation can be fulfilled until after the rapture of the church so…it’s looking good! I’m ready to fly in the twinkling of an eye, so whenever that trumpet sounds I’m good to go! How bout you? There is so much more to Bible prophecy than most even know so I hope you don’t mind but I’m going to link a question below that I received about “Nostradamus” that I answered with Bible prophecies alone. It explains the connection between the “end day” prophecies of Daniel and the “70th week of Daniel” and the prophecies of Revelation 6–18, or the “tribulation” which is one and the same 7 year timeframe. It reveals the specific prophecy that, when fulfilled, will reveal the identity of the Biblical Antichrist, trigger the start of the tribulation, and give those who are still here on earth the ability to calculate the exact day of the Second Coming of Christ. Understanding the Daniel-Revelation connection really helps us to understand the placement of the puzzle pieces of Bible prophecy. The linked question/answer has 3 more answers linked to the bottom of it, so between the 4 there is a lot of information on Bible prophecy, and one answer that focuses on Biblical salvation. One answer proves that although it is not the “end of the world” as some are fearing, it is the “end of the world as we know it” as we are incredibly close to the remainder of prophecy being fulfilled. The third gives Scriptural evidence that the rapture precedes the tribulation and that those who have repented of their sins and turned to Christ and Christ alone for the forgiveness of their sins and for salvation can count on soon being removed from the earth in the “twinkling of an eye” whether they’re “ready or not!” I think the accurate teaching of the rapture is so scarce in the church that the majority of Christians will be shocked and pleasantly surprised to find themselves in the clouds with Christ in the near future despite the fact that they knew very little about Bible prophecy. Fortunately for the church, the only requirement for us to be taken in the rapture is that we are born again. Bible knowledge and prophecy knowledge are not requirements. The rapture is imminent, so for that reason and more, [because none of us knows if we have tomorrow], I plead with those who do not yet know the Lord to repent and give their lives to the Lord now! Please, please do not wait, because although people can still give their lives to the Lord after the rapture, and during the tribulation they will then pay for their newfound faith with their very lives, as persecution and then martyrdom of Christians will become global during the tribulation. I hope you’ll read my linked answers and will consider all that God’s word has to say about the days that are soon coming [if you don’t know already.] The clock is ticking…again…so please don’t wait.

It is the process of hiring, firing, training, and motivating employees in a business. 1. Employee data storage: Without wasting time on paperwork, HR representatives can easily process employee information on the system, and the ERP software system is an efficient way to store and recall employee data as needed. HRMS aids in the efficient, safe, and secure storage of all of this system’s data so that it can be retrieved for administrative purposes. GwayERP HRMs automate time-consuming paperwork and other employee record-keeping tasks such as employment history, education qualification, compensation and benefits, and personal identification proof. 2. Recruitment management: GwayERP manual hiring and onboarding is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process that necessitates a large number of man-hours that could be spent on more productive activities. It is simple, user-friendly software that automates various aspects of recruiting, such as sourcing, screening, documentation, and onboarding, to drastically reduce human effort and time spent on hiring. Can quickly screen resumes and online applications to identify the best candidates and manage a pool of ideal candidates for future job openings. 3. Attendance and time management: HRMS provides a reliable attendance tracking system (ATS) to the company. This amazing feature enables HR professionals or managers to keep track of an employee’s attendance and absences. It makes the requests easier to process for both parties. Managers can use this integrated attendance system to quickly access the leaves database to determine an employee’s total available leaves and approve or reject the request based on availability. This system is also accessible to employees, making the process more transparent. Employees can thus learn the reasons for the approval or rejection of attendance or leave requests. 4. Accelerates the organization’s effectiveness: Unlike traditional tools, HRM software does not require much human effort. Because HRM’s systems are fully automated, they can handle time-consuming and manual tasks on their own. You only need to issue commands, and the software will handle the rest. From data management to hiring. HRMS expedite all operations. It increases transparency and employee engagement within the company. With the help of various functions such as employee evaluation and disciplinary tracking. This is demonstrated by the company’s effective management of its employees and resources, which results in the company’s growth and expansion. 5. Eliminating human errors: One of the most significant benefits of an HRM is the elimination of human errors. Most payroll management and filing tasks can be automated with GwayERP HRMs, which not only saves time but also eliminates common errors such as incorrect salary calculations, double credits, missed deductions, and so on. Another major source of unnecessary business costs is human error. HR task automation reduces the likelihood of common errors such as double entries and allows employees to double-check their work for any possible type. 6. Cost-effective: HRM software enables organizations to manage all human resource tasks in a single system, lowering the costs associated with correcting human errors and the budget required to handle an organization’s workforce performance. As a result, HRMs are a cost-effective solution regardless of the size of the business. Replace time-consuming data entry tasks with automated technology to save your company money. Apart from initial cost savings, automation eliminates the need for paper by digitizing all processes. Companies, such as payroll, demand that an employee monitor and track the attendance and leave processes. Businesses can go digital and use HRMS to automate mundane managerial tasks instead of hiring people to manage these processes. 7. Enhance employee self-service: Employees frequently have a wide range of questions and concerns, and they expect detailed and immediate responses. When a company has hundreds of employees, it is frequently impossible for the HR team to respond to every employee's query. A good HRM system can provide better self-service options to employees. All they have to do is enter the policies and other data into the integrated system. Employees can also log in to their accounts and look up any information they need without bothering the HR department. This continuous flow of information increases workplace transparency and efficiency. 8. Training management: This feature of GwayERP [LINKED_TEXT: custom erp software] [URL: https://gwayerp.com/] monitors and reports on employee instructor-led training programs and courses. It manages training programs, grading, records, history, and schedules. 9. Payroll: A payroll is a collection of employees whose wages are processed regularly. Payroll errors can be a company’s undoing, so payroll must be carefully managed. An HRM can calculate paychecks, control the pay schedule, and ensure accuracy. Payroll has a large impact on an employee’s relationship with their employer. An integrated HRM software application with your payroll software can improve efficiency. It collects data for attendance, net pay calculation, salary distribution, tax filing, and other purposes."},{"prompt":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","completion":"There’s a difference between “supposedly fiscally responsible” and “fiscally responsible”.

Yes, I am an atheist who is pro-choice, but I used to be a Christian so hear me out. Only God can make Godly laws. Humans all fall short of God, and therefor any law we make will fall short of Godliness. Yes, I know that you all think abortion is murder, but it was not seen that way in the Bible UNLESS the baby was viable outside of the womb. Otherwise it was not that big of a deal. Any Christians who tell you differently are flat out lying to you. They will twist every verse they can to prove their point, but they will also steer clear of those that actually do deal with it. Also, regardless of what religious people think, the United States is a secular nation, and has always been a secular nation. It is an earthly nation. To force your views onto others is not Godly either. If you believe in the Bible then you have to believe that God gave unto people the gift of free will. They have free will to believe in him or not. No where in the Bible does God justify those who follow Christ taking away the free will of others. It only tells you to not act as the non-believers do.

(1) In 2010 the IMF lent Euro 30 billion to Greece as part of a much larger package to support the ailing economy. The IMF explained at the time that it had lent 3200% of quota, well over its normal limits for a country in difficulty. It gave Greece “exceptional access to IMF resources”. The IMF cited the need to prevent the crisis spreading to other parts of the EU and to defend the Euro. In 2012 the IMF decided to lend Greece a new Euro 28bn as part of a replacement loan package. It drew attention this time to a “significant large competitiveness gap” (stronger language than 2010) and to a high level of public debt. This time it agreed with a major write down of privately held Greek public sector debt (75% written off) and required cuts in the minimum wage as part of its measures to improve competitiveness. Once again Greece received special treatment with a large loan. I queried why the IMF would do this for a country which is no longer sovereign in monetary and economic matters, as its status with the Euro prevents a normal IMF recovery package. (2) The International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a 1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.Eurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn't come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum Sunday in which Greek voters can decide whether to approve a deal proposed by the country's creditors. A \\"No\\" vote would likely force Greece to stop using the euro currency. The last country to miss an IMF loan payment was Zimbabwe in 2001. (3) The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent €2.5 billion less on payments.Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of €8.4 billion, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund’s reserves, which now total €19 billion. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece’s total debt to the IMF is currently €24 billion.

Not only this, look at his face when Obito attacked him He was completely surprised by his attack, and Juubito blitzed the living crap out of him For the second one, Juubito actually reacted to the attack by phasing through it, only to find himself unable to do so Look what happened when BSM Naruto and KCM2 Minato, who are both faster than SM Naruto, failed to lay a hit on Juubito when they were teleported by Tobirama So, had Obito known that he cannot phase through the attack, this is what would have happened.

Think about it for a second. Over the course of your business with these customers, you’ve provided them with a service they’re happy with, and have in many cases made their lives easier by fixing a problem they used to have. But above all, you’ve built a relationship with them, and that’s a powerful thing. For you to be a successful business, you need to cultivate the relationships you already have and offer incentives to get them coming back to you again and again. Why waste time and effort chasing down new clients, when you can turn your existing ones into repeat customers? How to Incentivize Your Customers to Come Back to You Again and Again Once you’ve realised that your most valuable assets are your current customers, it’s time to start [LINKED_TEXT: incentivising those customers] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/academy/incentives-loyalty-service-business] to come back to your business again and again.

Your past customers would probably jump at the opportunity to re-experience the joy of having their lives improved through your work. But without incentives, most people are going to lack the nudge they need to make another booking. By creating incentives you can re-engage your past customers, improve their lives, and make them loyal to your brand for life. Stay In Touch In today’s digital age, staying in touch with customers doesn’t need to be difficult. Emails can be used to say thank you (like on anniversary dates, birthdays, or other special occasions), promote a service or product when you want to increase sales, to stay in touch with relevant updates from your field, collect customer feedback, and much more. With almost unlimited uses, email should be a regular part of your customer communications.

Share seasonal updates that prompt them to call you (like checking your A/C before summer or checking for leaks before it starts freezing). Reward Loyalty Once you have re-engaged your past customers with a new offer or by reaching out to them for their feedback, it’s time to start rewarding them for their loyalty and lock their business in for a lifetime.

What I wish to address is the concept of ‘scope of understanding’. For an example, we, as a people, don’t bitch and moan when taxes are withheld from our paychecks anywhere NEAR what we would do if we were required to simply write the Gum’ment a check on the 15th for the exact same amount. Leaving aside that most of us couldn’t cover said check, when we saw exactly how much the esteemed electorate of our country was siphoning off of our lifestyles things would get, well, ugly. They certainly did for France. And China. And Russia. And the budding US. Venezuela, suit up; you’re on in five. People would go berserk, our elected leaders would likely end up swinging from a tree, and a whole BUNCH of our stupid policies and decisions would get corrected. Likewise, back in the ‘80s, there was some sort of scandal involving the Congressional bank; I believe word got leaked that Congress folk did NOT have to pay a fee if they bounced a check. No matter HOW big. And it appeared that they did it a LOT. Now, the average joe can’t comprehend giving away 60 blujillion dollars to ‘Krudfukistan’…but they CAN understand, fully, what a bounced check fee is. And how merciless the banks could be concerning these fees-which were hitting people that (obviously) couldn’t afford it. But our leaders did NOT have to deal with the same issue, and could write as many checks as they wanted while the rest of us ended getting crucified. And if I remember correctly, the country went nutz. Both sides were howling for some heads. Our elected leaders-for the first time in near recall-became aware that they had just about pissed off the whole country. And that their careers (“My job is to keep my job!”) had just gone into extreme jeopardy from a totally unplanned occurrence. They scrambled QUICKLY to get the bounced check fees reinstated (although I believe the system lets them dispute a bounced check fee with an almost 100% success rate, as long as they do it in writing). Quietly, of course. Likewise, people don’t hate Voldemort for being a mass killer-we just don’t really get that. But-BY GOD!-we DO understand the petty miseries that a pencil-pushing bully like Deloras Umbridge represents. Every last one of us has to deal with that crap on a reoccurring basis, so we understand it fully. So, the long and the short is people don’t understand-or comprehend-giving DuPont or ConEd or whoever some big tax break for XXX (heh) dollars, mainly because it’s not like anyone actually wrote a check. But they DO understand loans, and what happens if a payment is missed. So people don't’ like the fact that someone else may be getting off of the hook…even if it’s a hook that appears to have been created, supported, and sanctioned by the exact government that is trying to back track on the issue now. Kinda like how they backtracked on the bounced check fees. The real answer here appears to be that no one wants anyone else going over the student loan program too closely-if we did, we’d see unreasonable rates, non-existent requirements for applications, absolutely no oversight, exemption from bankruptcy declarations ( no one ELSE gets this) and I suspect that our senators have a hand in the same companies that administer these loans. In short, our politburo (both sides) is the group that sanctioned this-they threw a bunch of people just getting their start in life under the bus. Sure, some partied, but not all. It should be noted that college tuitions skyrocketed about the same time that all of this money became available, making it even harder for someone who didn't have access to cash attend. o much for higher learning institution… It is my sincere wish that right, left, and middle sides grab our leaders by the throats and start shaking until we get some answers. But we are not going to do that until we get past the ‘Forgive the loans/Make the Bastards Pay” debacle. As long as we are at each other’s throats we’re are not going after theirs.

Living there, the village turned off the water a couple of times to do work on the sewage system, and my crazy neighbors would call the landlord to DEMAND that the water be turned back on and/or DEMAND that they be given a rent adjustment! Sure it was an annoyance, but there wasn’t a thing the landlord could do about it. They complained about everything. They broke a window and demanded that the landlord fix it. I can tell you that if I accidentally broke a window I’d consider it my responsibility to fix the darn thing! 2nd time was upstate New York, Delaware County 1990. After the first year, I was informed that my rent was being lowered by 25. Again, my neighbors were awful people that would pretty much trash a place and then complain that the landlord wouldn’t fix it. They complained about pretty much everything. When I moved out my neighbors informed me that I would never get my deposit back; that he never, ever returned the deposit. I was nervous! I needed that deposit because I had borrowed the deposit on my next apartment. To make matters worse, I wasn’t able to connect with his agent for a walk through and had to just drop off the keys in her mailbox. A week or so later a check arrived in the mail. For a little more than my original deposit. I called to tell him he sent me too much. He informed me that the law says that I get my deposit back plus 3% interest, less any damages/cleaning required. And since I’d left it move-in ready, I got it all plus. I cleaned, mopped, painted, cleaned the stove, oven, fridge. The only thing I didn’t finish was the back wall of the closet and I guess he figured that was good enough. And I didn’t leave my garbage behind. Turns out when you respect your landlords right to get his money on time every month and your own responsibility to return rented property in the same condition that you received said property, it’s worth it! I honestly don’t know how landlords do it. I don’t know how they ever actually make money, considering the poor condition most tenants leave behind. I did some cleaning for someone that owned rental properties and I was astounded at what so-called civilized people would do to property not their own. More than once I thought a place had been abandoned for a long period and occupied by squatters and the owner was just getting it ready for a first time rental. Turned out that it had just been vacated by a legal renter very recently! It looked like they had food fights in that place!"},{"prompt":"Which rock band has had the most messed up/dysfunctional history?","completion":"Probably the Rolling Stones, sex, drugs, death of their founder & general nastiness all in the name of rock n roll."},{"prompt":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","completion":"We tend to spend a third of our day on a mattress, so opting for the right one is an essential decision.

The way they see the good in everyone before ever judging and believe me it takes a while for the process of judging to even begin makes people feel accepted and comfortable. We will always try to at the very least to understand where others are coming from. This is why we are so confusing to many. We can contradict ourselves in conversation simply because it is very hard for us to not see all sides. This s even true when we are speaking of our views. It will go something like this. I think she was wrong for what she did but that being said certain people were not treating her very well. Then we will go in that direction explaining why she may have reacted in the wrong manner. There is an exception to this however. That is when there is cruelty or bullying of others that are in a weaker position or if their deep values are violated. In that instance all bets are off the table and they will not hold back with you.

Companies will post a job, perhaps on a few different sites. Then job robots will repost the job over more sites. Then many companies no longer remove a posting after the Job is filled because it takes so long to find qualified people and even if they do the robot re-posters will be slow to age off the job posting. All of this added together gives the impression that there are 10 times as many job openings as there are. But there is another problem. Companies, particularly those hiring through HR departments or headhunters, hire via laundry list of skills. Rarely are tools and skill requirements the same for two different companies. Typically a qualified candidate may match 50% of the skills advertised and have no experience with the other half. This causes HR departments or managers to reject the candidate until a match comes along or, more likely, they are desperate for help. For each critical skill the time needed to find a candidate increases exponentially. So jobs often stay on the wire for a year or more when prime candidates are available. This results in a opening backlog an order of magnitude larger than it should be."},{"prompt":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

Suppose we looked through one of our most powerful telescopes toward the “edge” of the observable universe. We might see one or more very distant galaxies 13+ billion light years away from us. We see their red-shifted light and calculate their distance and speed of recession from us. Now suppose that on a planet in one of those distant galaxies is some being looking at us through his powerful telescope. If our galaxy is younger than his by even only a few million years, our light will not have reached him yet, and he will not “see” us. We will appear dark to him, but the effects of the gravity we generate may be visible to him on older light-emitting objects in our neighborhood perturbed by our gravity. He might even be tempted to name us something he calls dark matter. I realize this is a vast oversimplification of all the potential mechanisms involved in such a scenario, but is there a theory such as this to explain one possible source of what we currently call dark matter?"},{"prompt":"Which of the following numbers doesn't belong: 64, 16, 36, 32, 8, 4?","completion":"36 because it has prime factors other than 2 aslo. whereas, 64 = 2×2×2×2×2×2 = 2^6 16= 2×2×2×2 = 2^4 32= 2×2×2×2×2 = 2^5 8 = 2×2×2 = 2^3 4 = 2×2 = 2^2"},{"prompt":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","completion":"Any type of cigarette paper is terrific for cleaning pads on woodwinds.

It must be grounded on some concept of “the same”. Standardly, we use what I call the Traditional Theory of Identity (TTI), which says that a=b iff they partake all properties (not just some). Identity means numerical identity. And, furthermore, according to TTI there are no substrata, no haecceities, nothing more than properties. Classical logic and standard mathematics, say that one which can be developed in a set theory such as ZFC, encompass TTI in some way. Leibniz holds: there are no indistinguishable but (numerically) identical things. So, when the ship had one of its planks exchanged by another one, it became another ship. This is logic, as far as we accept it. So, strictly speaking, we are changing ourselves in each instant of time: we are perdurants. But, if you prefer to say that the ship remains the same, you must present us your theory of identity. And I anticipate: it will be a theory of something different, for identity tout court means numerical identity. Relative identity, vague identity, whatever adjective you may use, are related concepts, but not numerical identity."},{"prompt":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","completion":"My aunt was blind and forgetting things when she turned 80.

A war torn country, a failed state is what most of us think of this place but in reality, all of this, our perception is built around what has happen in the last 15 years which is true. A great injustice is people don't know how many times Iraq and especially Baghdad have have been wiped out just to make way for a greater state. what is happening now, Iraq has seen numerous times before. it has seen grater oppression and has seen its sovereignty violated it has experienced its rivers run red with the blood of fallen martyrs. like its mystical past almost ironic Iraq will surly rise from the rubble and heal its wounds of war like its has done for the past 5000 years. To understand the fabric of this region one needs to go back before america, before Saddam, before the mongols and even Islam. The history of Iraq begins ever since the start of human civilisation thus earning it the title of 'the cradle of civilisation' numerous times this area has experienced periods of utopia from the pre-historic ubaid period when this area advanced in architecture innovating new tools and methods of agriculture only to be conquered by the priest king of umma being destroyed only to make a way for a more civilised and advanced society, throughout the bronze, iron and middle ages this would be a repeating process where Iraq would reach a pinnacle of development only to be conquered and the process being repeated. On the advent of Islam, Iraq experienced the greatest tragedy in Islamic history it is without doubt the event of karbala when mentioned even today brings anger and sorrow in eyes of millions of Muslims around the world.Where members of the prophet Muhammad's (sallahualayhiwassalm) family including his grandson were killed, small children martyred resulting in widespread chaos and war. after the situation normalised the Islamic world was experiencing peace, the lands ruled by Muslims stretched from Spain in the west to India in the east. Every field of science was being dominated by Muslim scholars, astronomy, physics, geography biology, major breakthroughs and medical equipment being manufactured, a scientific revolution, a golden age was overcoming Islam and Iraq would be at the centre of it all. Being situated on the ancient silk road a road connecting china with the west already made Iraq's position and economy very strong amongst the ancient city the paper industry of Baghdad was a an international market trading paper from buyers t seller from around the world. . Science, technology and poetry would transform Baghdad in to a true middle age metropolis and would remain so for the next 500 years. having a population of over one million and also being one of the fist city's in the world to be master planned . Artists and intellectuals from all around the world would come to Baghdad from the bazaars to the court of the king the talk of the day would be regarding the branches of science and knowledge. translators would be paid the weight of the book in gold if they translated from ancient Greek in to Arabic. Europe was going through its dark ages so the intellectuals of Baghdad rushed to preserve these manuscripts. the caliph at the time established a library calling it 'bayt ul hikmat' or 'the house of wisdom' housing millions of manuscripts. As destiny would have it the Mongolians under the leadership of hulagu khan invaded Iraq as they had heard of its riches and beauty. not caring for the manuscripts that had consumed so many resources to accumulate indiscriminately killing whoever trod there path.books thrown in to the river and the library burnt, what had taken centuries to accomplish had taken just under a week to be reduced to rubble. As we come forward after the Ottoman rule the British would implement there own choice of ruler and as a voice from the people against the administration grew, the baath party managed to gain power whilst its leader would be Saddam Hussein. Under Saddam, Iraq would become a fairly wealthy country being a close ally of the U.S Iraq developed problems with Iran, pressure from the U.S resulted in Iraq and Iran going to war leading to economic downturn after 9/11 america decided it would remove Saddam as he was accused of using chemical weapons again Kurds and possessing \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" . 2003 was when the war began and 2006 was when Saddam was convicted and hanged. after the deaths of 1.2 million Iraqis infrastructure ruined and no sense of safety america and its allys withdrew leaving a vacuum of power left for anyone one with a some power to overtake since then we have seen a constant shift of territory being controlled by I.S.I.S., rebels and whats left of the administration. It has been almost 15 years since the fall of Saddam and the destruction of Iraq many people have been left thinking will the situation ever become normal? like how it used to be? Analysing the past and the history of Iraq we can say for certain a day will come where once again the people of Iraq will be safe and free. innovation and engineering new ideas and methods like they have done for the past five thousand years. read more at my in my blog: [LINKED_TEXT: Iraq | An untold story] [URL: https://makpaktube.blogspot.com/2017/09/iraq-untold-story.html]"},{"prompt":"When did Humayun sit on the throne of Delhi for the first time?","completion":"Akbar was the third Mughal emperor.

No, my Instagram is public and it’s even listed small at the very top of my Quora page. I just made the decision not to SPAM you guys with it in all of my answers. It’s a visual journal. This is kind of my written journal in a lot of ways because I pick what to answer based on whatever jumps out at me. My use of a personal Instagram page started around 6 or so months after I began writing here and at first it was all arty but it ended up being a sort of visual equivalent of this kind of expression. I mean it’s still pretty arty. But less traumatized and disoriented. I had to sort out how to say things visually again. My Instagram name is Flipping _The_Narrative. One reason for that is that it’s the visual flip side of my written record keeping.

The number of unique chess games is estimated to be 10^120, while the observable universe has roughly 10^80 atoms. 5. The average person walks the equivalent of three times around the world in a lifetime. This estimation is based on an average walking speed and the average distance people walk over their lifetime. 6. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the first moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Cleopatra lived around 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid was built around 2560 BCE, and the first moon landing occurred in 1969 CE. 7. Mount Everest is not the tallest mountain on Earth.

It is forever changing, but nearly always rooted in the blues. It has a rich tradition and its own rules, but it is brand new every night. It is about just making a living, and taking terrible risks.

While some may find chubby cheeks endearing, others long for sharp features such as a chiseled jawline, sharp nose, and sculpted cheekbones. For those who desire a slimmer face, facial fat and double chin can be challenging to get rid of. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore various methods and strategies to help you learn how to lose facial fat effectively and achieve that flattering, sharp facial appearance. 1. Practice Cardio Exercise If losing weight and achieving a more svelte figure is your goal, then cardio exercise—a type of aerobic activity—is a prime contender to include in your fitness routine. But did you know that such exercise can also contribute towards facial slimming? Alongside its well established benefits for shedding total body fat and reducing midriff circumference while promoting an increase in lean body mass (i.e. spare body mass) cardiovascular workouts could also help you slim down where it matters most to you: the face! To reap maximum benefits from this powerful form of exercise its important to commit to moderate to vigorous sessions lasting at least 150–300 minutes every week. And with an array of popular cardio activities—including running, dancing, walking, biking and swimming—to choose from there’s no shortage of enjoyable ways to achieve your fitness goals. 2. Perform Facial Exercises Facial exercises may help strengthen and tone facial muscles, potentially reducing facial fat. Despite no direct scientific research investigating whether there’s any correlation between exercising certain muscles in the face with shedding fat from this area specifically some clues indicate that incorporating particular workouts may boost overall muscle tone throughout this region. An example could be expelling air back-and-forth through relaxed cheeks or puckering lips on opposite corners alternatively or even smiling with gritted teeth briefly to target specific areas. By integrating these patterns into your daily routine, you may enjoy better-defined, firmer facial features with the added benefit of potentially losing weight as well. 3. Reduce Alcohol Consumption Excessive alcohol intake can cause dehydration, prompting the body to retain water. In some cases, water retention can lead to bloating and puffiness in the face, making it appear larger. Alcohol also contains empty calories, which offer no nutritional benefit and can contribute to weight gain. To lose facial fat effectively, consider reducing your alcohol consumption or limiting it to moderate levels, defined as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 4. Drink More Water Drinking water can help you feel fuller, reduce your overall caloric intake, and promote gradual weight loss. Additionally, water consumption promotes lipolysis, the process by which the body breaks down fat stores into fatty acids used as energy. By staying well-hydrated, you can support overall weight management, which in turn may help decrease facial fat. 5. Get Adequate Sleep Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight gain, which can contribute to facial fat. Lack of sleep can affect hormone levels, increasing appetite and leading to higher caloric intake. Aim for at least 8 hours of sleep per night to support weight management and facial fat reduction. 6. Improve Overall Diet Consuming diet high in processed foods and refined carbohydrates will increase risk of weight gain and obesity. Processed foods often contain more calories, salt, and sugar than whole foods, while refined carbohydrates lack essential nutrients and fiber. To lose facial fat effectively, focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in lean proteins, whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. By combining a healthy diet with regular exercise, you can lose excess fat in the face and body. 7. Reduce Salt Intake High salt intake can cause water retention, leading to swelling and puffiness in various parts of the body, including the face. To reduce facial fat, try limiting your consumption of high-salt foods, like processed meals and snacks. Preparing meals and snacks at home allows you more control over amount of salt in your diet, helping you achieve slimmer face. 8. Focus on Overall Weight Loss As mentioned earlier, spot reduction, or targeted fat loss from a specific part of the body, is not supported by scientific evidence. Instead, focus on reducing overall body fat through healthy diet and lifestyle changes. If you lose weight, you are likely to see a slimming effect on your face well. 9. Incorporate Yoga Poses Yoga poses can help tone and stretch facial muscles, contributing to a slimmer face. Some effective yoga poses for facial fat reduction include Simha Mudra (Lion Pose) and Jivha Bandha (Locked Tongue Pose). Practicing these poses regularly can help improve facial muscle tone and provide a more youthful, sculpted appearance. 10. Implement Lifestyle Changes Long-term habits and broader lifestyle changes play a significant role in preventing weight gain and fat accumulation. To maintain a healthy weight and prevent facial fat, consider the following tips. Exercise regularly, incorporating cardio routines to improve overall health and prevent weight gain.Eat a balanced diet rich in lean protein, whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Limit the consumption of processed foods and refined carbohydrates.Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks, including energy drinks, juices, and sodas.Prioritize sleep, aiming for at least 8 hours per night.Manage stress levels through techniques such as yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practices. Frequently Asked Questions How can I lose face fat in a week? It will be challenging to lose a significant amount of facial fat in just one week, you can take steps to reduce swelling and fluid retention, making your face appear slimmer. Focus on staying hydrated, reducing alcohol consumption, getting enough sleep, and limiting salt intake to see quick improvements. What kills face fat? There is no specific “magic bullet” to eliminate facial fat. However, a combination of healthy lifestyle habits, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, and adequate sleep, can help reduce facial fat over time. Conclusion Losing facial fat can be a grueling process, but by incorporating the strategies outlined in this companion, you can achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face. Flash back to prioritize overall weight loss and borrow healthy life habits to support long- continuing results. Always consult with healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine to insure your approach is safe and effective for your individual requirements."},{"prompt":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","completion":"Imagine a question is asked - Q : Would you rather have 30 million dollars or 30 million loyal friend?

Can you offer some examples?","completion":"Learning about it upon your question, it is a subjectivist pleasure thought for those who seek power for the sake of seeking power. If we look at the stop sign example given by other contributor here, the sign serves the purpose of protection from danger. It might be who stops is protected, or someone else. However, the danger must be real and probable. Otherwise a stop sign would be ignored in a short while. The “signifier\\" should better do his job right to earn a paycheck. Accordingly, Derrida offers a fantasy that a “signifier” has the power of creating authority through a symbol. The symbol is only taken seriously when a probable harm is abstracted with it. Either reality is corresponded, or the sign is a decoration. Subjectivists have a tendency of buying Derrida's stuff. It is about hearing what they want to hear.

Tensorflow is as good as Torch. Both are very equivalent regardless of their capabilities, architectures, and interface. The main difference is their integration, Torch requires LuaJIT, and Tensorflow can be run on Python and compiled in C++. I prefer Python so I choose Tensorflow. But really it is up to you.

In Rogue One, Vader was slaughtering Rebel insurgents because he was trying to retrieve the Death Star plans.

Just imagine the vastness of the cosmos and the countless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. *Our brains are incredible organs, and it's astonishing to learn that the human brain generates more electrical impulses in a single day than all the telephones in the world combined. It's a testament to the complexity and power of our minds. *When it comes to biodiversity, the Amazon rainforest is a true marvel. It houses about 10% of all the species on Earth, making it one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. The intricate web of life within the rainforest is truly awe-inspiring. *Moving from the macro to the micro, did you know that a teaspoon of soil contains more living organisms than there are people on the planet? It's incredible to think about the hidden world beneath our feet and the essential role these microorganisms play in sustaining life. *The Great Wall of China, often considered one of the most impressive man-made structures, stretches over 13,000 miles (21,196 kilometers) in length. It's so extensive that it can be seen from space—an awe-inspiring testament to human engineering and determination. *The world's oceans are a source of endless fascination. Did you know that we have explored less than 5% of them? The vast majority of the ocean remains uncharted, holding countless mysteries and undiscovered species. *In terms of scale, consider this: If our solar system were the size of a typical dinner plate, the Milky Way galaxy would span the distance of about two football fields. And the universe contains billions of galaxies! Contemplating the vastness of space can leave us in awe of its sheer magnitude. * Human DNA, the building block of life, is astonishingly complex. If you unraveled all the DNA molecules in a single human body and placed them end to end, they would stretch from the Earth to the Sun and back more than 300 times. It's a testament to the intricacy of our genetic code. * Time is a fascinating concept, and here's a mind-blowing fact: Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt, lived closer in time to the construction of the first Pizza Hut than she did to the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It highlights the vast stretches of history and the interconnectedness of different eras. * The human body is a remarkable machine. Every minute, your body produces about 2.5 million red blood cells, constantly replenishing your blood supply and ensuring the delivery of oxygen to every corner of your body. * The concept of deep time can be mind-boggling. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for a staggering 165 million years, compared to the mere few hundred thousand years of human existence. It puts our own place in the history of the planet into perspective. * The deepest part of the world's oceans is the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. Descending to a depth of approximately 36,070 feet (10,972 meters), it reaches deeper than the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on land. Exploring the mysteries of the deep sea is a reminder of the incredible diversity and resilience of life on Earth. * The largest living structure on Earth is the Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Australia. Stretching over 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers), it is composed of billions of tiny organisms called coral polyps. This vibrant underwater ecosystem is home to a multitude of marine species and showcases the beauty and complexity of our planet's biodiversity. * Light travels at a mind-boggling speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second). To put it into perspective, light from the Sun takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. Contemplating the speed at which light travels opens up a realm of possibilities and challenges our notions of time and distance. * The human body is a host to trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the human microbiome. In fact, these microorganisms outnumber our own cells by a ratio of about 3 to 1. This intricate symbiotic relationship between our bodies and the microorganisms living within us is a testament to the complexity of life and its interconnectedness. * The world's largest known living organism is a grove of quaking aspen trees in Utah, known as Pando. It covers an area of about 106 acres (43 hectares) and is estimated to be thousands of years old. Despite its massive size, Pando is considered a single organism, as all the trees in the grove are genetically identical and connected through a vast underground root system. * The phenomenon of black holes is both fascinating and mind-bending. These incredibly dense objects have gravitational forces so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. The concept of black holes challenges our understanding of space, time, and the fundamental laws of physics. * The human brain is often touted as the most complex structure in the known universe. It contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections, forming an intricate network that allows us to think, feel, and experience the world. Exploring the mysteries of the brain and its immense potential continues to be a captivating frontier of scientific discovery. *The concept of time dilation in Einstein's theory of relativity is fascinating.

The \\"Great Oxidation Event\\" was a pivotal event in Earth's history that occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. It marked a significant rise in atmospheric oxygen levels due to the proliferation of photosynthetic organisms, leading to the eventual development of complex life forms. 96. The \\"Panspermia\\" hypothesis suggests that life on Earth may have originated from microorganisms or organic molecules transported through space on comets, meteoroids, or other celestial bodies. This idea raises intriguing possibilities about the interconnectedness of life in the universe. 97. The phenomenon of \\"quantum superposition\\" allows quantum particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. It is the basis for quantum computing and holds potential for revolutionizing information processing and cryptography. 98. The \\"Borromean Rings\\" are a mathematical construction of three interlocking rings that are interconnected in such a way that if one ring is removed, the other two fall apart. They represent an intriguing example of the mathematical concept of topological entanglement. 99. The \\"Beau Lotto Effect\\" refers to the ability of the brain to perceive colors differently based on surrounding context. This effect demonstrates the subjectivity of our perceptions and highlights how our brains actively construct our experience of reality. 100.

It was so far beyond good that I struggle to find a word. Compare the shuttle to every launch platform that came before and its innovation and importance becomes clear. Now how did I come to a dramatically different conclusion than what other people are saying? Simple. They are comparing the shuttle to what might have been, while I am comparing the shuttle to what had actually come before. Yes, the DOD pushed Congress to turn the shuttle into something far, far less than it could have been. Even so, it was the first reusable launch platform. Five shuttles flew well over 100 missions, and the shuttle was essential to building the international space station. The design of the shuttle was a factor in the losses of Challenger and Columbia. However, incompetence and bravado at NASA were the proximate causes. As a pragmatist, I don’t spend a ton of time thinking about what might have been. The space shuttle served as a launch and research/experimentation platform for three decades. I really can’t see how anybody can say that it was a failure.

It's a genius marketing tactic because then people would likely buy 2 different products for different purposes… the Mac and then the iPad. So for example, an artist can use the iPad to draw an animation, then transfer that to a Mac PC then to edit it. Or a business person can do work on a Mac PC, then use Apple's iCloud to save the documents then jump on their iPad to pull up that document if they need a touch screen. So really the answer is Apple wants the Mac experience to be the way they want it which is no touch screen.. and secondly, it's a great marketing tactic because it would mean a person would likely buy 2 different products.. if the Macbook had a touch screen and removable keyboard, then there would be little use for an iPad. So keeping touch screen separate from the Mac is a way for them maximize profit. By the way, Apple changed the OS name of the iPad because they don't want people to think it's using iOS when it is."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

I moved to CA in 1989 to pursue a career in Federal Law Enforcement. The adjustment wasn’t too hard since the money I was to make doubled from where I was in AZ. It was also twice as expensive. Example: I went from 100/Mo in a 3bd/2ba house with two other roommates to paying 375/mo in a 2bd/2ba Apt with one other roommate. Plus utilities. Over the years the politics changed many things like property taxes, vehicle registration and cost of living. Still being connected to AZ and even GA where I was born, I could see how there wasn’t as significant of changes in those states. Mainly fuel prices. When I decided to retire at the end of 2016 I had no plan to leave although I talked the game with many coworkers. It became sensible when my girlfriend, who was still working, decided to pursue promotion back in AZ. I had to think about it long and hard. CA has its advantages and I had become used to it. On the other hand my kids were all adults now and only two of four remained there (a third left within a year of me). So after three years of retirement, off to AZ we went. You could notice the changes immediately. Fuel, food, taxes, the people. I registered a vehicle for two years which was less than one year in CA. And we got a beautiful house, one I never could’ve imagine living in as a child. Besides being back amongst old friends and family my confirmation came with my first year of filing taxes back in AZ. I paid 33% less in state taxes. I can always visit CA as my GF still owns a house there and I have a camping membership with parks there."},{"prompt":"What are the benefits of recumbent exercise bikes?","completion":"Increased Safety Recumbent bikes can be used by a wide range of people - by people in rehab centers, people with neurological conditions, and elderly people. The seat is wider and closer to the ground, which makes them the safest type of stationary bike. More Number Of Targeted Muscles Cycling, in general, helps you build muscles in your thighs, legs, and glutes. Recumbent bikes target more number of muscles than other cycling exercises because your leg positions are different. Motivation To Push Harder and Farther The comfort of the recumbent bike helps you feel motivated through your workout. It’s more likely that you’ll hop back on the bike tomorrow if the bike is super comfortable and you love cycling on it. Not so if it causes butt and back pain. If you keep your body pain-free, you’ll be able to push harder. Increased Comfort There’s a good amount of research which shows that recumbent bikes are easier on the knees and back, and this makes them suitable for use by patients suffering from arthritis and similar problems. The larger seat, semi-reclining position, and back rest of the recumbent bike help in providing greater comfort and make sure that you do not encounter any pain in the buttocks after extended usage. These are some of the many benefits of a recumbent bike. Although the differences between all the bikes are very nuanced, the impact created is pretty huge!

It makes an odd shape thinking of bowling pins formation mirrored, missing pieces to a square (and the last row would have to be sawed in half like a canoe), or as a rectangle instead of a square."},{"prompt":"Why is the board/card game Munchkin demonized by board game enthusiasts?","completion":"Munchkin, even by its name, is a satire of the worst aspects of traditional table-top RPG gaming. In an RPG, you develop a character, a role, that you play in the game. You build a back story, a personality, and over time tell that character’s story of adventure and derring-do. Or, you could interpret the game as ignoring all that “role-playing” stuff, and merely go into dungeons, kick down doors, kill the monsters, and loot their corpses getting bigger and better stuff as you go. This latter way is generally looked down upon by serious RPG players. It’s considered childish, and players who play like that are referred to as “munchkins”, in reference to the characters from The Wizard of Oz. Wikipedia defines munchkins as synonymous with “powergamer”, and glosses it as “a player who plays a non-competitive game in a competitive manner”. It is not a positive term. The card game plays on that, deliberately invoking the name “Munchkin”, and boiling the game down to “Kick down the door, fight the monster, loot treasure, go to next room and repeat”. As a game, it’s basic concept is a joke, about how deep down that’s really how we want to play RPGs. That joke isn’t enough to carry the game very far. The basic mechanics could lead to a single-player game, but doesn’t really by itself carry a multiplayer game. So mechanics of alliances and backstabbing are added — other players can help you fight the monster, in exchange for a share of the loot, and other players can also interfere to hinder you. Great! Interaction between the players! But not a lot, and nothing you can count on. It also has positive feedback loops and no real negative feedback loops: If you do well, you get better equipment, which makes it more likely for you to keep doing well, etc, exponentially. If you are doing poorly, you can’t catch up. The only negative feedback happens when players gang up on whomever is in the lead. Usually, this only delays the inevitable, as players burn through their cards trying to stop the one player at Level 9 from winning even one fight against a randomly chosen monster. Sometime the delay can be substantial, and the game feels like you quickly move up through the lower levels (where you don’t have a lot of power alone, and spend a lot of time helping each other or running away), and then get near the top and the game turns into a slog (where every player is trying to stop the front-runner, with some success, until the front-runner gets lucky and no one can stop them). It is easy to see who is ahead at any time; it is easy to see who has a lot of strength. There is no mystery to the scoring, there is no mystery to the strategy. Compare that to a lot of other popular games. “Ticket To Ride” has many ways to earn points towards winning, some of which aren’t revealed until the end of the game.

Alpha is a word which states the characteristics of a confident male with a clear vision on how he wishes to carry himself, and the objectices he wishes to accomplish, while taking full responsibility over the consequences of his existance; positive or negative, he makes sure to handle it. These attributes when meshed with the functions of an INFJ would produce an individual who's not considered with the exterior factors provided by anywhat and anywho. In more detail, an alpha INFJ has taken the responsibility of developing his introverted intuition, extraverted feeling, introverted thinking, and extraverted sensing. In order to gather as much information as possible about the exterior world, while using the introverted intuition to come up with various theories as to what the best plan is required in order to reach thd objective at hand ( Whatever it may be ). From an exterior point of view, the alpha INFJ is calm and collected because he has mastered patience, when the opportunity arises he executes the theorie he had come up with via introverted intuition, while utilising extraverted feeling in order to preserve the dignity of other males, all while scoring a touchdown such as in this answer. Then he retreats wherever he finds peace to work on his one big dream. Why does an Alpha INFJ retreat after scoring ? An Alpha INFJ has developed his understanding of existance as a whole, so his ideas and emotions are very deep and mature. He understands the consequences of a simple word, or a simple touch. Exterior environment has not made such sacrifices in order to possess a strong consciousness, which means that the exterior environment is immature, dull, and completely irrelavent because the majority of people would say and do anything for a direct on the spot result, an Alpha INFJ is too wise to make such reckless moves. He only executes when it is necessary in order to bring about positivity in his life and those beloved to him.

Is this borderline high?","completion":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 mmHg falls within the prehypertension category, which means that it is slightly elevated but not yet considered high blood pressure (hypertension). However, it is still important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and make lifestyle changes to keep it within a healthy range. A resting heart rate (pulse) of 52 beats per minute is generally considered normal for an adult. However, your heart rate can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and medication use. It's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or healthcare provider about your blood pressure and heart rate readings, especially if you have any concerns about your health.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

People always book \\"cheap\\" rooms through various websites, all claiming to get a \\"great deal\\". Then they rock up to my hotel (5 star in an international city) and are surprised that they aren't getting a view, or a high floor, or even any additional benefits without paying more money. How shocking! The better way to go about planning your stay is to look to the reason why you are traveling to that place. Going for business? A four star hotel with decent wifi and room service will be right. Going someplace nice, and expect to explore and not stay at the hotel much? Again, a four star hotel might do the trick. Location is important, but you don't have to be right on the water to have a good hotel. For the five star and popular located hotels, it pays to pay. Going \\"cheap\\" doesn't mean you'll always get what you want. But if you pay, and usually directly to the hotel and not through a third party, you'll get good service and exactly what you want (view, high floor, ect). On a side note, join up with that hotel reward program. You may not get immediate benefit beyond perhaps complimentary wifi access, but it does help in the long run. I know people who have joined a hotel reward program not thinking much of it, and became surprised when they used it enough to be recognized for benefits (this is, of course, meaning that they chose that hotel often enough to be rewarded)."},{"prompt":"Why don't people do their homework and study it out to realize Obama is a communist?","completion":"Because those people have better things to do with their time than waste it on utter nonsense.

But as a freelancer who travels 5-6 times a year on average, it is really troublesome. Not only do I do price comparisons, but I also ask about extra baggage allowance. So I was looking to see if there was a website that would allow me to book flights easily while saving the most money. Here is my review of WayAway. What is WayAway? Wayaway is a brand-new flight aggregator that compares the costs of tickets from hundreds of companies and offers the best deals available. Additionally, with WayAway's Plus Membership program, travelers receive immediate payback on flights and other travel-related services including hotels, vehicle rentals, and local experiences rather than collecting miles. For specific travelers who reserve a hotel, a car, local tours, and other travel services, it can be a great price.

The majority of your vacation expenses typically include flights, and although some people insist on making reservations with particular, famous airlines, others just want to pay the lowest possible price. The aviation sector is expected to experience several changes, and analysts think a large rise in the cost of airline tickets. Therefore, it will be even more important for the majority of people to find the best deals on airline tickets and other travel-related services. As an example, the following comparison is made between WayAway and Skyscanner for the same journey. WayAway price[/caption] I looked for the same route (San Francisco-New York) via WayAway and Skyscanner: Ticket price on Skyscanner: 174Ticket price on Wayaway: 165 In general, the direct purchase price provided by WayAway will be cheaper than other airline agents, and WayAway will also provide additional cash back. The overall price will be at least 20 a ticket lower than other airlines. It is worth noting that the air tickets provided on Wayaway are not necessarily the cheapest prices every time. And the airline is not necessarily a well-known airline. If you are very concerned, you need to compare it with other aviation agents. What are the benefits of WayAway？ WayAway Plus: Offers cashback on hotel, travel, transport, hire cars, attractions, and more. You receive your rewards in dollars, and you have unlimited access to your PayPal account balance.Price including luggage is immediately seen： Choose the right luggage weight Pick the right flight ticket.

In addition to being easy to navigate, the website makes it very clear what is included in the ticket and what choices you have for your preferred route. The fact that a flight's details go beyond a one-word description like \\"economy\\" to include information like the perks and seat information is another feature I like. If you are a person who travels frequently or needs to travel frequently, then the Plus membership is particularly important. Because you can take advantage of premium membership for cashback.You can search for exactly how much cash back you'll get on each flight, and easily claim extra cash-back rewards via PayPal after your trip."},{"prompt":"Will the megacomet heading towards Earth hit Earth?","completion":"No. (with very high certainty - it’s going to get no closer than Saturn)"},{"prompt":"Does Erdogan need to step down?","completion":"Another troll question for black propaganda!

An Eau De Toilette (EDT) is made up of around 4%-8% of perfume oil. This is too much oil to apply to the face, so it should be put on the 'pulse points' (neck, wrist, or chest).

The secret is that we all have a silent inner voice, always explaining, narrating, and enjoying life and its descriptions. The thing to know about writing is that (with practice just by doing it) it is simply the act of putting that voice down into a medium of communication. Keyboarding or writing with a pen becomes automatic. We master the medium we use to create (or write) and express that inner voice. Writing is just: Letting people know what you think.Letting people know what you dream.Letting people know what you want for the world.Sharing your imaginative voice, your story, the characters you think about, the people you know.

Not only has Chidambaram made fortune for himself and his family, he has steadfastly stood loyally behind #10, Jan Path. Congress always wanted the imbroglio in Kashmir to continue as it benefitted from it.

What is excessively? In Canada, if you feel that you need to see a doctor, then you go see a doctor. If it is something small, then by seeing the doctor you are preventing it from becoming something more serious that costs a lot more to treat. If the visits are indicative of a mental disorder, such as hypochondria, then it gives the doctor the ability to refer the patient to someone that can treat that problem. The problem we have in Canada, is that there is a shortage of Family Practitioners, and this shortage drives people to Emergency Rooms for treatment for small ailments, which in turn diminishes the care they receive of follow up, and strains the Emergency Care system. The problem is not, and never has been, excessive visits for treatment. That assertion is nothing more than propaganda in order to maintain an existing system that profits off of healthcare.

Here is why: There are thee things that make the Milky Way highly visible: Away from outdoor lighting: far away from cities, airports, factories, mines, oil fields, etc.Little to scatter any light in the air: Low Humidity and few particulates like dust and smokeThin air; the closer to space the better (higher altitude). Northern Hemisphere In most of North America, Europe, and populated parts of the Pacific rim the night sky is spoiled by outdoor lights. In the United States the high deserts and intermountain plateau can be quite good. Because of continental weather fronts, pollution, and fires, the good conditions happen on only about 1/3 of nights. The high deserts of central Asia can also be very good. Overall the Northern Hemisphere doesn’t have a great view of the Milky Way, even during the northern summer months. It faces the wrong way, leaving the most interesting and brightest parts of the Milky Way below the horizon year round. Southern Hemisphere The Southern Hemisphere is much better positioned to view the center of the Milky Way, the brightest and most interesting part, during the southern winter months. Here we find: Antarctica There are no cities or other sources of artificial light except for a few scientific stations where outdoor lighting is well controlled. It is the driest desert on the planet.It is the driest desert on the planet. At the south pole, humidity is often below 0.1%!Much of Antactica is at high altitudes, the South Pole is over 9,000 ft. In spite of some isolation from many weather fronts, cloudy days are relatively common. Still Antarctica probably has the best skies on the planet when the sky is clear. The Atacama Desert region of Chile. 1. Population is low with only a couple of small cities. Cities and towns are far apart with few people living between them. 2. It is the 2nd driest desert on the planet with humidity often below ten percent. 3. It is a high desert with altitudes above 8,000 feet common. Fortunately the Atacama has a unique geography that gives it clear skies for about 90% of nights. The high Andes remove most moisture from the prevailing weather fronts approaching from the east. On the west the very cold Humboldt current causes the air to sink which keeps costal fog and clouds away. The result is that Antarctica has a slight edge in low light pollution and humidity, but the Atacama (roughly the northern third of Chile) has a big edge in the number of clear nights. The result is that Chile now has over two thirds of the large telescope infrastructure in the world! Here is an image with the center of the Milky Way straight overhead that I took from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) support facility. More information see: [LINKED_TEXT: ACEAP 2019: ALMA Radio Telescope] [URL: http://astronomy.robpettengill.org/blog190804.html] This was taken from beside a busy walkway between the common area and the dormitory wings in the residencia. The automatic lights had no effect on the image because the air was so clear. Other Southern Hemisphere locations There are other places in the Southern Hemisphere with very good skies and views of the Milky Way. These include the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa and the South Island of New Zealand. Worldwide locations Although the center of the Milky Way is the most spectacular, there are lots of things to see in the northern Milky way.

This is the turbulence in the atmosphere which causes stars to twinkle. Twinkling adds a note of interest to the stars when viewing by eye, but it’s not good when using a telescope or camera. When you take images of stars through a telescope, twinkling causes blurring. Seeing is best when the atmosphere is stable with less turbulence. A stable atmosphere has low wind velocities and uniform temperature. Uniform temperature on the ground stabilizes the air above it. Oceans, flat snow covered landscapes, and high desert basin locations tend to have good seeing. Mountains disrupt prevailing air currents and cause turbulence and poor seeing on the ground. If you are on a high mountain in the thin air above most of the turbulence, the seeing improves. Astronomers pay attention to three measures of the atmosphere: Clouds - you can't see through themTransparency - moisture, dust, & smoke make faint fuzzy objects like galaxies and nebulas dimmer and reflect light from the ground making light pollution worse.Seeing - atmospheric turbulence makes the stars jump around and twinkle, blurring detailed images. Everyone cares about the clouds. Planetary astrophotographers want good seeing for detailed images, but care less about transparency. Deep space astrophotographers want good transparency to capture dim distant targets but may care less about seeing. When matters just as much as where.

Being an English player, he was highly hyped and too much was expected of him. Balon D'ors, Golden boots, etc. Too much was expected of him. He would have achieved all that, if it wasn't for the rise of Messi and Ronaldo. Arguably, the 2 G.O.A.Ts. As Rooney grew older, he started going deeper and deeper into the midfield looking for the ball whenever it wasn't in the opponents box. This left Manchester United without a centre forward during counter attacks. Sir Alex Ferguson noticed this and started to buy centre forwards to play alongside Rooney. Berbatov, Chicharito, Tevez, Van Persie, etc. All were bought to play as out and out strikers, while Rooney led the creativity part in the No.10. A role he excelled at. This led to Rooney's reduction in goal scoring but increased his assists and chances created. Playing him in multiple positions as a utility player when someone was injured or out for one reason or another, didn't help much. Many Manchester United fans who don't know much about football, felt Wayne Rooney was no longer a world class player. The other issue is that Rooney's bulk physique couldn't allow him to play many years into his thirties. That's why he burnt out early and retired shortly after leaving Manchester United. Despite all the odds being against him, he went on to become the greatest player in Manchester United history. But make no mistake about it, Wayne Rooney was a monster of a player.

This is the question commonly asked by people who see someone like that or who had never faced a problem in relationships. If we ask this to the person who is in an abusive relationship they will give us multiple reasons, they may know it is not good for themselves and their life even then they continue to stay with their own reasons. [LINKED_TEXT: Why Do People Stay in Abusive Relationships?People who have never been abused often wonder why a person wouldn’t leave an abuser. They don’t understand that leaving can be complicated and dangerous. Leaving is often the most dangerous time for a victim because abuse is about power and control. When a victim leaves, they are taking control of their life. This threatens the abuser’s power and could cause him or her to retaliate. Aside from this, there are many reasons why people stay in abusive relationships. Here are a few of the common ones: Fear : A person may be afraid of what will happen if they leave the relationship. Believing Abuse is Normal : A person may not know what a healthy relationship looks like. They may have grown up in an environment where abuse was common. They may not recognize that their relationship is unhealthy. Fear of Being Outed : If someone is in an LGBTQIA relationship and has not yet come out publicly , their partner may threaten to reveal this secret . Embarrassment or Shame : It’s often difficult for someone to admit that they’ve been abused . They may feel they’ve done something wrong by becoming involved with an abusive partner. A common worry is that friends and family will judge them. Low Self-Esteem: Abusers erode their partners' self-esteem with constant put-downs and blame. It can be easy for the victim to believe those statements and think that the abuse is their fault. Love : So often, the victim feels love for their abusive partner. They may have children with them and want to maintain their family. Abusive people are often charming at the beginning of a relationship. The victim may hope that their partner will go back to being that person again. They may only want to stop the violence, not end the relationship. Cultural/Religious Reasons : Traditional gender roles may influence a person to stay. In some cultures and religions, ending the relationship would disgrace the family . Language Barriers/Immigration Status : A person without proper documents may fear reporting abuse. They likely do not know the resources available to domestic violence survivors. If their first language isn’t English, it can also be difficult to express their situation to others. Lack of Money/Resources: Financial abuse is common in domestic violence relationships. A victim may be dependent on their abusive partner for money and resources. Without those things, it can seem impossible for them to leave the relationship. This reason is especially prevalent if the person lives with the abuser. Disability : Physical or mental dependency on an abusive partner makes it difficult to leave . A person often feels a need for the relationship even if it is abusive. This dependency is a big factor in their decision to stay in an abusive relationship.https://survivorshelpline.org/why-do-people-stay-in-abusive-relationships.php] [URL: https://survivorshelpline.org/why-do-people-stay-in-abusive-relationships.php]Emotional abuse is not taken seriously: Emotional abuse is dishearteningly common in a relationship but not many consider it dangerous enough due to the absence of physical violence. Without a trace of harm, affects the person’s psychological well-being, making them feel worthless and helpless. Assuming that they do not have an option other than tolerating the situation, they do not seem to be able to muster the courage to come out of that relationship.Trust in their love: Love is the main reason for many to stay in abusive behavior. They believe that their partner will change and they will lead a happy life after. They believe that they can change their partner by love and they continue to forgive their partner. They try many things to change their partners, they keep trying and the process never ends.Social states: Nowadays social states have become more important than their own life or happiness so they are in a relationship even if it kills them inside, they behave like a happy couple outside just to match the other couples and show others that their life is good and perfect too. They are not ready to accept the reality and come out of their sadness they just leave in that dark and show their fake happiness to everyone so no one gets to know their pain for others to help too.Doing something good after abuse: This is the common reason is seen, where they come with an apology, prepares a romantic date, promises to never do this again. This will change the person’s mind of being abused and make them believe that things will change from now and they continue to be in the same relationship. Even though they know things will never change and the abusive behavior will come again, they accept the apology they believe everything the person says and which makes the person feel sorry, believe them, and they continue their relationship. Believes: ‘it's normal to have an abusive relationship and everyone goes through it’ this has been blindly accepted by many and they go throw all of their problems. Without breaking up their relationship.Growing up with it: If a person is been grown in an abusive family where fights between mother and father are common or the person has been hit and said that it is for their good then the person will take the abusive behavior as a good thing which is for their good and it is because they have done a mistake before.Family: if they are married and they have their own children it’s hard to come out of their relationship they suppress all their hate and hurt just for their kids and continue to be in that relationship. Dangerous: In some relationships, it is really dangerous to come out of it, they fear leaving their partner as it may also end in dangering their life. There have been many situations where one’s life has ended because they left their partner, they also blackmail their partner saying that they will not leave them to have a peaceful life so in these fears they end up being in an abusive relationship. Blaming themselves: Blaming themselves will always give a reason to stay, so many people start blaming themselves to just solve the problem, for the time and they also accept that it’s their mistake and they are the reason for their partner’s behavior, they also change their behavior to get adjust with their relationship.

Actually the fact that Marathas had an Empire, is unknown to most people across India. Those communities who sucked up to the Mughals and later to the British East India Company, are portrayed as great warriors. Majority of people in India don't know that British East India Company fought the Marathas, mainly during Revolt of 1857, not other Hindu kings of northern India. During 1857, Hindu kings across India were mainly Maratha confederation, who fought against the British East India Company. Only Marathas defeated Muslim kings, other Hindu kings of northern India sucked up to the Mughals. That's the major reason why they distanced themselves from Marathas, when Marathas were to fight powerful Durrani empire of Ahmed Shah Abdali. It was Marathas who freed north India from Mughal Rule. Jats , Rajputs and Sikhs had one time or another fought under Mughal Flag. They all had kept Representatives in Mughal Durbar to curry favours. Not surprisingly they never allied themselves with Marathas against Ahmed Shah Abdali of Durrani Empire. They were all opportunistic fighters, fought only for material gains. Rajputs fought the Jats on behalf of the Mughals. Google Jai Singh fort of Thun How Rajputs defeated the Jats..? Sawai Jai Singh went to fight against Churaman Jat near Agra . ... In August 1722, Sawai Jai Singh was appointed subahdar ( viceroy ) of Agra and Mohammad Shah was the ruler at Delhi and ordered Sawai Jai Singh to capture Thun, the capital of Jats who had rebelled again against the ruler at Delhi . While Aurangzeb was sinking deeper into the morass of his Deccan Wars, the Jats overthrew the Mughal administration in Agra province. Sawai Raja Jai Singh received large funds from the Mughal courts and with the support of Bhim Singh Hada, of Kotah, Gaj Raj Singh of Narwar, and Budh Singh Hada of Bundi, besieged the fort of Thun in 1716. Churaman's nephew Thakur Badan Singh came over to Jai Singh and provided him with vital information on the weak points of Thun. After its conquest Jai Singh captured and demolished other smaller forts and dispersed the Jat confederacies for a short period. From Wikipedia How Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar was deposed.? To fight the Sayyids, Farrukhsiyar summoned Ajit Singh, Nizam-ul-Mulk and Sarbuland Khan to the court with their troops; the armies' combined strength was 80,000. He did not summon Mir Jumla III and Khan Dauran, since the former failed in a campaign in Bihar and he felt that the latter had conspired with the Sayyid brothers to depose him. However, Syed Abdullah's troop strength was about 3,000. According to Satish Chandra, Farrukhsiyar could have defeated him with the help of the nobles; he did not do it, since he believed it would be difficult to get rid of them afterwards. He appointed Muhammad Murad Kashmiri as the new wazir (prime minister), replacing Syed Abdullah. Kashmiri was a notorious for having sexual relationships with boys; this angered the nobles, who resigned from his court. Ajit Singh, alienated because he was removed from Gujarat for oppression, also sided with the Sayyids.[44] By the end of 1718, when Syed Hussain began his march from the Deccan with 10,000 troops under Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, Farrukhsiyar could only secure Jai Singh II's support. Syed Hussain's excuse for marching towards Delhi was to bring a son of the Maratha ruler Shahu to him.[45] With the support of Mohammad Amin Khan, Ajit Singh and Khan Dauran, Syed Hussain fought Farrukhsiyar; after a night-long battle, he was deposed on 28 February 1719.[46] The Sayyid brothers placed Rafi ud-Darajat on the throne. Farrukhsiyar was imprisoned in Tripolia and blinded.[47] During his imprisonment he was served bitter, salty food and deprived of water. He passed the time by reciting verses from the Quran.[48] Although Farrukhsiyar tried to bribe jailer Abdullah Khan Afghan with the command of 7,000 troops if he released him and brought him to Jai Singh II, the bribe was refused.[49] On 19 April 1719 he was strangled by unknown assailants and buried in Humayun's Tomb beside his father, Azim-ush-Shan.[50]"},{"prompt":"w badly would Madara wreck Tobirama if they got into a fight?","completion":"How badly would Madara wreck Tobirama if they fought? They did fight, and if it wasn’t for Hashirama’s man-crush on Madara, Tobirama would have ended Madara’s life like he did Izuna’s. Edit: Before I get another comment saying Tobirama came in for the final kill after Hashirama fought Madara. A) Read the other comments before commenting please and B) I see that fight is the wrong word to use here, so I’ll saying ‘They did encounter one other, and if it wasn’t for Hashirama’s man-crush on Madara…” because the main purpose of this first part is to say Tobirama has no relation to Madara and he has a bloodlust for Uchiha so nothing’s stopping him from killing Madara if he gets the chance. Hashirama literally had to put himself between Madara and Tobirama to stop Tobirama from stabbing Madara. Tobirama is more powerful than people give him credit for and the fact that he has no emotional attachment to Madara makes him even more likely to kill Madara than Hashirama is, because throughout their encounters Hashirama was always holding back, to the point where he apologised upon ‘killing’ Madara. Tobirama flat-out hated the Uchiha and any chance he got he would’ve killed Madara, think about it, Madara’s speciality is Fire Style and Tobirama is the best Water Style user in the series, he’s a natural counter to Madara, he’s a natural counter to every Uchiha in the series. Don’t take Tobirama Senju lightly, he earned his title as Second Hokage. The only time Madara was able to hold a candle to Tobirama was when Tobirama was reanimated and he was alive with Rinnegan eyes, which was when he had Hashirama buffs and Sage Mode energy and was able to use the chakra rods to hold him down. But if it was one-on-one, and they were both alive, Madara would have a lot more difficulty fighting Tobirama than you’d think. Edit: Since people pointed out that the actual battle was more Hashirama vs Madara than Tobirama vs Madara, I’ll have to elaborate on why I doubt Madara would be able to wreck Tobirama. MS Madara vs Tobirama would be Tobirama 8/10 because MS Madara and MS Izuna were supposed to be equal in strength in every way, and Tobirama actually managed to use Izuna’s Mangekyou Sharingan against him to kill him. MS Izuna never held a candle to Tobirama so Tobirama gets the win there. EMS Madara vs Tobirama. By the time Madara unlocked EMS, Tobirama had already mastered Flying Raijin and Sensory Jutsu. So, it depends on how the battle would begin. If Madara got marked, no amount of Perfect Susanoo can peel off a seal that’s supposed to be permanently stuck onto you. So, if Madara does use his Perfect Susanoo it does give him a great edge over Tobirama but A) Perfect Susanoo isn’t 100% invincible, a powerful enough attack can open a hole in it and if Tobirama opens up a weak spot, none of Madara’s Fire Style Technique can stop the Water Style Tobirama, reminder that this is pre-Wood Style. B) Madara is an Uchiha, Tobirama is a Senju, Tobirama naturally has a lot more stamina than Madara and unlike Hashirama, Tobirama doesn’t have to do the honourable thing and fight Madara head-on, he could easily use Edo Tensei or Shadow Clones to keep Madara busy for hours and then when Madara’s weakened, come in for a final hit. C) If it boils down to a massive Perfect Susanoo trying to slice at a tiny Tobirama, then Tobirama’s got the speed and the stamina to exhaust Madara, because Tobirama is a lot faster than Madara and Madara even admits that Madara also states here that neither Hashirama nor Tobirama are at their full power, which is why Tobirama wasn’t able to jump Madara and Madara was able to drain Hashirama’s Sage Mode so easily. So, when it comes to EMS Madara, I’d still give Tobirama the leg up 6/10 times. Why? Tobirama is faster, he has more stamina and more chakra, he’s more battle-wise (I’m looking at it in a matter of Hashirama was able to trick Madara and Tobirama was advising Hashirama as Hokage) and his Water Style is a natural counter for Madara’s Fire Style so there’s no Jutsu Madara could throw at him that he couldn’t deflect. Literally the only thing Madara has over Tobirama is Perfect Susanoo. The only battle that Madara would have an edge over Tobirama in is Rinnegan Madara vs Tobirama and Juubidara vs Tobirama because in both those cases Madara is not only faster than Tobirama but he’s got more chakra, more elemental abilities and he’s a lot stronger than Tobirama."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"When it comes to finding the top freelancing platforms, there are several reputable options available.

Travel Agencies and Tour Operators are not exceptional. Most of the travel companies and travel agencies are installed CRM systems in their office which assists them in many departments, such as Payment Collection, Tracking, Competition from other agencies. A good CRM can beat up all these problems. As an example, If we are considering payment, many manual integrations needed for it. Voucher and invoice creations are a time-consuming process. Not only these, tracking of all the enquiries and updation of packages according to the market fluctuations are very hard to crack. A good CRM for Travel Agents can cover up all these difficulties.

Always Pay high for the best. Don't bargain with best products. In studies also, excellency comes from extreme hardwork you have to pay huge fees in terms of hardwork (what we call mehnat in Hindi) and get the best results. As you show, so shall you reap! Don't do daydreaming of getting 100% results with cheap products. As you all know, Poor man who runs a business wants to be paid for his work , instead of claiming being their relative and demanding everything free it would be better if a relative pay extra for their better care as they are the closest and they too are well aware of their financial position, let this open up their eyes. A doctor relative wants free treatment from their so-called young childrens but they forget that the degree comes from rigourous 5.5 yrs of studies and spending of huge money for the college infrastructure. In body fitness too, going to gym and paying nothing for the daily diet will seen to be useless. Getting up early at 3:00 and running till 9:00 and eating chole-batore in afternoon will give no positive results rather you might become a bit more fatter. You need not only to pay a fixed amount for the gym but you also have to pay for your daily diet. Diet control is vital for fitness and eating less doesn't mean dieting whereas eating healthy, costly juices means dieting. Nothing is free! Air, water, and sun resources management is vital and I'd you don't want to be paid for this. Please , please conserve it asap! Use renewable resources, follow 3r’s in your activities.

Airline pilots get to work on simulators a lot. Most pilots don't get that much time in simulators. The Asiana flight 214 that crashed short of the runway in San Francisco had poorly trained pilots that knew the auto pilot system like the back of their hand but could not hand fly a simple visual approach. Their culture also does not allow disrespect or disagreement by lower ranking members of the crew. No one disagreed with the pilot until it was too late to stop the crash even though the aircraft was below glideslope. Over dependence on technology lead to the crash when the ILS system was down and a visual approach was required. Even when I had an autopilot availiable I did not use it until I had over 300 hours experence and even then only to reduce fatigue on long flights. I hope this helps, Happy Landings, Ross CFI CFII MEI ATP SEL SES UAV PPC and USPPA Instructor"},{"prompt":"My partner of one month doesn’t like my therapy dog of 10 years. What should I do?","completion":"When I read your question my first thought was: \\"How much do you really have in common with this person of one month's duration\\"? Are they really able to understand your needs? Not only do you need your therapy dog as a helper in your life (you don't say what form the therapy takes, but I imagine the dog is a faithful helper with whatever you are in need of) -but you will also have a very strong loving bond with this dog after ten years! He/she will be a dear friend and companion. Is there some amount of jealousy do you think, concerning your so-called partner's dislike of your dog? I could understand if the dog had attacked this person, growls at them constantly or won't allow them near you. But I can't somehow imagine a therapy dog to behave like that (?) Well....it's up to you what you do of course, but I'd put all my money on the dog!"},{"prompt":"Why were top secret government documents unaccounted for at any time they were in someones possession?","completion":"That is a darn good question. Document clerks should have been screaming to get them returned every night when it’s time to lock them up until the next day.

He couldn’t do this on his own, being president or not."},{"prompt":"a supersymmetric particle been discovered?","completion":"No, no supersymmetric particles have been discovered experimentally. Supersymmetric theories have been forced to reside in progressively smaller corners of theory space.

Can you offer some examples?","completion":"Derrida was playing on the concept of Saussure that in linguistics you can speak of what is signified by the signifier. In other words, stop signs are made by sign-makers and come in the form of direct commands. Saussure also indicated the difference of sign with symbol—the latter having no other authority other than suggestion. Derrida’s point htne, is that asign is nothing more than a symbol whose creator has been given transcendent authority."},{"prompt":"w does the department Central Water Commission compare to Indian Railways in terms of growth, payscale, transfers, and work life in IES?","completion":"Only one line.

He stayed there for 1 year in which he just reported to work and came back home. Amazingly, his boss and his boss boss was doing the same thing. He was posted in Delhi."},{"prompt":"What is the most lucrative AWS certifications to get?","completion":"In general it’s the Architect Cert in both the associate and professional levels, but that assumes you have the experience to back it up. The Sysops and Devops cert tend to rate lower on pay, but that seems to have more to do with this path attracting lower skilled/experience QA and Sysadmins. Really what makes the difference in is your other skills and experience. If you look at job posting there are lots of posting that mention AWS experience and no cert requirements, while there are no postings with cert requirements and no AWS experience. The Associate Architect Cert is really just intro to AWS on a technical level. It’s not really that deep or useful by itself. What it’s good for is getting a job a company that is using AWS, but you still need the sysadmin or programming experience for these jobs. It’s sounds nice, but people in the business know what it means. The Professional Architect Cert is intended for people with experience in designing cloud infrastructure and apps. Studying for the cert and passing the test means you have a pretty good theoretical understand of designing AWS infrastructure and apps, but no one wants to hire an AWS Architect with zero experience. You really need additional skill sets and years of experience AWS to get a job as AWS Architect. The Security Cert is another good cert for (as is true for any sort of Security Cert). That said again everyone wants experience as no one wants to hire a security guy with no experience. The most lucrative set is going to be Associate Architect -> Professional Architect -> Advanced Security, but it’s not going to do you much good if you don’t have years of IT Security experience in the enterprise. Likewise Associate Architect -> Professional Architect -> Advanced Networking is lucrative if you have a lot IT experience in the enterprise or building large scale apps. (A starting or mid leevel IT guy with the same set of certs is not going to bring in the same pay, but it’s still a move for your career and pay.) If you are a QA guy or a Programer going the Sysops/Developer->Devops->Networking is going to bring you more and jobs than the Architect as some employer are going to pass you up as only stay long enough to get the experince to land an Architect role. (You totally should take the Professional Architect exam once you get ~3 years of AWS under your belt, and get another job.) If you have no Sysadm, Dev, QA or similar experience getting any AWS cert is somewhat pointless. It might get you an entry level support job, but I’d look at getting a Linux, or Windows Sysadmin cert instead. (Or comptia A+ then Server, Cloud, Linux and/or Security cert.) If you are entry level you want to look at these sorts of skill sets. Html5->Javascript -> AWS Developer -> DevOps Sysadmin -> Python -> AWS Sysops -> DevOps Python -> Java -> Machine Learning -> AWS Developer Do yourself a favor after you get AWS Developer or AWS Sysops study up for the Associate Architect for a couple of weeks after you pass your 1st Associate exam. Associate Architect is easier than Dev, or Sysops and 90% of your study for Dev and Sysops will apply to Architect. (I passed the Architect without studying for it the same day as Sysops.) A lot of hiring managers are overly impressed with the Architect certs and multiple certs despite the Associate cert covering much the same materials."},{"prompt":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns? For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","completion":"Go to a gun shop and not a big box one. Look for a local owned one that also offers training along with guns. Most of these are prior military if not the owner then the employees. Either way these people have tons of experience, thoughts, ideas and stories. I can tell you correct names but you have nothing to look at. At the store they can show you what a magazine is.

Though, to be honest, almost all of the hate I’ve gotten on my appearance has been on this app. I’m not sure what it is about quorans but many of them seem to think it’s their duty to tell me how much they think I’ve destroyed my face and body with piercings, hair dye, and tattoos. I don’t understand the appeal. I mean, does it feel good? Does it make people feel better telling other people that they think they’re ugly for doing what they want to do with their own appearance? I think it’s sad. Sad people have such one dimensional thinking that they can only appreciate conventional and conservative beauty standards and then feel the need to hate on those who don’t. Having your preferences is fine, but to attack someone for not falling into that just tells the world that something is missing within yourself. The beautiful thing about humanity is that we’re all different. What we like, what we value, what we appreciate, differs from person to person. To alienate and try to cause harm to someone for being different from what you’re used to, or what you like, is ignorant and childish. If you disagree with what someone wants to do with their own body, do so in your own head and just be happy that they’re finding themselves."},{"prompt":"Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?","completion":"To win an election you have to convert the swing voters. Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband were never going to do that. It is more than possible that David Miliband could have done it - but the Labour Party chose Ed rather than David [massive sliding doors moment for the UK]. Tony Blair was incredibly successful at doing it. Unfortunately for Labour - but fortunately for the Conservative Party, most of the Labour Party membership live in a parallel universe where such a simple truth is against the fundamental laws of Physics. Hopefully, they might get it right this time and elect Keir Starmer. He is a Knight, a QC and has a working class background. But the membership may well think differently and nothing would please Boris more if they did."},{"prompt":"What can be done to help the people of North Korea achieve freedom politically, socially, and economically?","completion":"As long as the PRK poses no threat we must just leave them be and continue to open a dialog with them over trade and cultural exchanges where possible. Their proximity to South Korea will provide a continuous impetus for change as the DPRK slowly opens in increments.

Is all lower back pain the same? No, lower back pain can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term, over three months). 2. Can poor posture cause lower back pain? Yes, poor posture, especially when sitting for prolonged periods, can contribute to lower back pain. 3. Can exercise help lower back pain? Absolutely, certain exercises can strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility, thereby helping to relieve lower back pain. 4. Can stress cause lower back pain? Yes, stress can lead to muscle tension in the back, resulting in pain. 5. Does aging automatically lead to lower back pain? Not necessarily. While the risk of back pain increases with age due to factors like degenerative changes, not all older adults will experience lower back pain. Let's consider the story of John, a middle-aged man suffering from chronic lower back pain. John loved hiking, but his pain began interfering with his favorite activity. He decided to visit Dr. Harrison, a trusted chiropractor. Dr. Harrison was a competent and caring professional known for his thorough approach to chronic pain management. After a comprehensive evaluation, Dr. Harrison developed a personalized chronic pain treatment plan for John. The plan included gentle exercises, posture correction techniques, stress management strategies, and regular check-ups. John started noticing improvements within a few weeks. His pain lessened, and he gradually returned to hiking, his favorite pastime. This story illustrates the importance of a comprehensive, personalized approach to managing chronic lower back pain. Lower back pain can be particularly challenging when it becomes chronic. Chronic pain is not just prolonged pain; it's a different kind of pain that requires a different kind of treatment. When it comes to chronic pain management, a multifaceted approach is often the most effective. This may involve physical therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and psychological support, as chronic pain can affect mental health. The goal of chronic pain treatment is not just to relieve pain but also to improve function and overall quality of life. In addition to the treatment prescribed by your healthcare provider, there are self-care strategies that can help. Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, practicing good posture, and managing stress are all crucial parts of chronic pain management. Remember that everyone's experience with chronic pain is unique. What works for one person may not work for another. Therefore, it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a chronic pain treatment plan that fits your specific needs and circumstances. Finally, don't lose hope if the first treatment you try doesn't work. It can take time and patience to find the proper treatment or combination of treatments that will help you manage your chronic pain. Stay proactive, and keep the lines of communication open with your healthcare provider. I hope you found this blog post informative and helpful.

It’s such tasty, enjoyable food that the Philippines from around the globe want to eat at day time, lunch, dinner as well as breakfast time or any other time. So, people want to know, how to cook Longanisa properly. How to Cook Longanisa These pork sausage foods are frequently sold almost everywhere in the Philippines. The spicy or sweet tastes largely depend on which part of the country the Longanisa is cooked. In United States America, it’s easy to find Longanisa throughout almost every Asian grocery store that sells Philippine food products. It’s cost-effective, convenient to store and almost all of all, delicious and yummy slightly spicy pork sausage to eat delightfully. In many of the Philippines ’ homes, It’s undoubtedly a major staple brunch for the weekend. Pre-made Longanisa is available in supermarkets or Asian shops in the Philippines and some other places around the world. But, the Philippines live in the United States, mainly get frozen uncooked Longanisa which are available in Asian retailers. This powerful article will benefit younger generations who’ve been away from their families or who actually like to learn How to Cook Longanisa as well as How to Make Longanisa; and Longanisa’s various recipes. When people want to have Filipino food, they generally search for Filipino restaurants. But, finding Filipino food restaurants not very available in the USA, another problem is they might not have our favorite food Longanisa. A few years earlier, the number of Filipino food restaurants was not much available in America. But, days change now most major cities or tourist points and even in village areas have Filipino food restaurants to enjoy Longanisa. Nowadays, Whenever I go to Asian supermarkets, I’m going nuts with a lot of choices available. It seems like I’ve been in loops for an hour searching for things I need. There are just so many choices to be made. Though we all know, Longanisa is yummy if it’s filled with fat. That’s why I’d prefer to purchase pre-made. Once I sometimes used to make a sweet Longanisa recipe, although I probably waste time making a lot of it. That was quick to get that out of the refrigerator and cook."},{"prompt":"ve scientists ever made use of a Higgs boson’s ability to give other particles their properties?","completion":"There is no way to manipulate internal properties of particles and the Higgs boson (as also any other particle) cannot be used as a tool for that purpose. Masses of the elementary particles are result of the Higgs field coupling to them and there is no way to influence these couplings which are the physical constants which means that nothing is able to modify them. By the way the Higgs boson is very unstable (~10^-22 s) and it is possible only to observe its decay products and not the boson itself.

This is because I believe that if someone is working long hours and is financially supporting you, so you can have the opportunity to stay at home for your young children, then it is your job to take care of all the domestic stuff related to the care of your family. At the time my partner had a very responsible, high stress, high danger, very physically demanding job, which required him to leave home around 5.30 am and he would get home around 7.30 pm, so I felt it was only fair that when he was at home he could rest and relax as much as he wanted to. And if he had both days off for the weekend he used to like to do the garden work and if we took the kids on an outing he would do all the driving and take care of the kids a lot, so I could have some time to myself to relax. Every relationship situation is different, but I think as a stay at home parent you should structure your days like a work schedule and treat it with the same attitude you would if it was your job and you wouldn’t reasonably expect your partner to go to their own job and then come to your workplace and do part of your work, if you were employed by someone else, so it’s quite unreasonable to expect that at home. It is not, however unreasonable to expect your partner to put in an effort to spend quality time when they are home from work, with the kids and to help you with any tasks you have trouble doing on your own. If you treat your partner with love and respect, then there is a much higher chance that they will treat you the same, which ultimately is beneficial for the children when they see their parents working together to shoulder the responsibilities of having a home and children."},{"prompt":"Which actors have gotten into the Tollywood film industry due to nepotism?","completion":"I don't think they have come due to nepotism May be it is true that they were introduced into the cinemas because of their family background Later they proved themselves nd worked hard They even faced a lot of failures But they didn't get any movie offers because of their background like Bwood Ofcourse most of the top actors of Tollywood belong to cinema family background But I would say that 99.999% ,there is no nepotism in TOLLYWOOD There are a lot of self made actors in telugu.

A child is innocence, freshness of outlook. The hands are also childlike, indicating a playful way of doing things. The smile is about happiness.

I was one of those people who used to think that writing your own notes(handwritten notes) are more effective than just seeing somebody else's notes / seeing printed notes. But in the end, I realized that it's just a pre-conceived notion hammered into our minds, that “agar khudke notes nahi honge, toh yaad nahi rahega”. Trust me, it isn't anything like that! It might definitely be effective, but only for a short span of time. The thing that you should always keep in mind is :- Revision is the key :No matter how nicely or how dedicatedly you write your notes, it will matter only for a short span of time, and will not affect your performance at the end. What will affect your performance is “NO OF TIMES YOU HAVE REVISED THE NOTES, WHETHER IT BE YOUR OWN NOTES OR PRINTED NOTES OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S NOTES”. Whatever concepts you have acquired from the videos will stay with you for a short span of time, but in the long run, what will matter is the no of times you go through the notes, and the no of times you come up with your own concepts/tricks of remembering things while reading them.Diagrams: Subjects like Anatomy/ENT/Ophthalmology will have diagrams that are as it is asked in the exam papers as well. Printed noted will provide you with the advantage that they already come equipped with images and such diagrams, whether that be Dural venous sinuses/Head and neck arterial supply/Course of nerves or Nasal bones/ Nerves supplying the pinna or Diagrams of pathologies of Uveitis etc. and the list goes onTime division : Suppose you spend 8 hours, watching many videos and writing down your notes, you'd be tired by the end of 8 hours because you'd have watched videos plus paused the video multiple times to have jotted down the notes. Whereas if you'd have had readymade notes from any source, what you have to do is just concentrate on the videos and listen very carefully what the teacher is trying to say, rather than this constant headache that you have to pause the video, and jot down whatever the teacher is saying.If a video is suppose say of 1 hour duration, constantly pausing the video and taking notes will take you longer, say 1.30 hrs / 2 hrs. Rather you could have spent this extra time revising whatever you've just learnt/solving mcqs of the particular topic from the Qbank/any other review book. So basically, you get double the work done in the same time.Also, saara din kitna padhoge, if you get a extra bit of time from the time you saved, give it to yourself, and relax a bit, go out and play. Your entire life will be filled with studies the point you enter MBBS till the day you die. So don't spend all your time in studying, set aside a bit of time to yourself to get away from the pressure of studies, and rewind yourself a bit. All the best kid! 😄"},{"prompt":"Can we defeat Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle by having one person measure the particle's position, while another one measures its momentum, but the two people don't talk to each other, but give their results to a third party?","completion":"No, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to measure both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with absolute precision. Even if two people measure the position and momentum of a particle without communicating with each other, the results will still be subject to some degree of uncertainty."},{"prompt":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","completion":"A big problem is “gradualism”. The leftist anti gun tyrants know that if they just straight up caused a total gun ban that there would be much fighting over it, so they take bite after bite of our rights with an end goal of the total ban, while the leftist elites still have guns and armed guards. They take away some rights, like say the BS classification of bump stocks as machine guns. The gun ban tyrants claim a huge win and gloat and are energized. Some patriotic freedom fighters might go to court and it ends up in court a long time. The leftists hope for a win or the freedom fighters just lose interest and give up. So another piece of freedom lost, another move towards the totalitarian goal of banning arms for the common people. We must “just say no” and say no to any gun ban measures to stop the erosion of our rights."},{"prompt":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","completion":"Ah, here’s one.

Yes, you might pass an exam, you might get a Pass on the course when you should have had a Fail. But it doesn’t stop there. In order to understand the next course, you will have to have some understanding of the previous ones, sometimes all the way back to high school. If you have cheated your way up to here, you will not understand the basics—and crucially, when you come to the exam, you will not even understand the questions. If you don’t understand what they’re asking, you won’t even be able to cheat. You see, exams in science rarely, if ever, contain questions where you are simply required to have memorised something. Most questions will require you to apply a solution principle to a problem you haven’t seen before, usually in the form of extremely complex calculations. You would regularly have a problem like “Calculate how heat varies in an infinitely long steak with perfect insulation on one end when it is put in an oven where the temperature varies as [math]T = k e^{1/t}[/math]”, and your answer is not a number, but an an equation spanning two or three lines. You see how “cheating” isn’t actually going to get you anywhere. You can’t write down the answer beforehand, the best you can do is to memorise how to use the general method on this particular problem—which is exactly what you were supposed to do anyway. And if you cheated your way to a position where you’re even given this exam, you’re not even going to understand the question. Higher education in science is not about memorising stuff.

The regular scientific Gamma Ray would make Superman more powerful. Gamma-ray bursts are among the most distant objects known, they can be brighter than anything else in the sky and so must be the most luminous objects in the universe. In their 10 seconds of glory, they release about 1044 J, 100 times more energy than the Sun gives out in its 10 billion year life. Even the most powerful quasars are 1000 times less luminous. If your talking total potential with indefinite time, the prize goes to quasars. If your talking potential of instance, probably hypernova. Realitically, though, notwithstanding the aforementioned subjectivity, their scales are so large and disproportionate to anything we have that there cannot be a real answer, both mathematically and in terms of comprehension. Superman would not want Hulk’s Gamma. It’s magic in the purest transcendental form. It would severely harm Superman. Gamma Rays are just a form of light. Light is really a wave, and like any sort of wave - even the kind in the water - there's a specific distance from one wave crest to the next. That distance, quite sensibly, is called the wavelength. The only difference between two colors of the light you can see is their wavelengths. Blue is a different (shorter) wavelength than red is. That's also the only difference between blue and X-rays, which have a much shorter wavelength than blue. Gamma Rays are really light rays with an extremely short wavelength - shorter, by far, than X-rays. This property of Gamma Radiation makes it very plausible - there's a very wide range of Gamma wavelengths that Kryptonite could be emitting, many of which we haven't discovered yet. Gamma Rays are also very energetic and penetrating, and they travel at the speed of light (since they are light). So they could quickly penetrate the body, and quickly cause their damage. Gamma Rays, like Kryptonite, can be blocked by lead, with the specific wavelength of the ray determining how much lead is needed to block it. For all these reasons, it's obvious that Kryptonite must be giving off some form of Gamma Radiation. Of course, the radioactive emission of Gamma Rays always accompanies the other two types, and so Kryptonite is also emitting either Alpha or Beta particles - but these would be insignificant in their effect on Superman. A moderate dose has an interesting effect. His veins seem to pop out and turn visibly green, suggesting the blood may be somehow spreading the effect. And indeed, the K-men we briefly saw time-traveling from the future described the effect as a \\"fatal blood poisoning\\". In heavy doses, the Kryptonian's body will actually glow green, like the Kryptonite itself, and by this time he or she is very close to death. These effects are very unusual, compared with the typical effects of radioactivity on a human. Gamma Rays in particular, since they're so penetrating, cause diffuse damage throughout the body (As opposed to the other types, which tend to inflict only surface damage such as skin burns). Victims may experience nausea and vomiting, neurological symptoms, and damage to their cells or to their DNA (often leading to the formation of cancers). But Kryptonians don't seem to exhibit any of these symptoms. Superman is protected from most forms of radiation we've seen. For the Alpha and Beta rays, he has an advanced bio-electric field which deflects them away from his body (This is a fair assumption since normal humans have a bio-electric field, only much weaker, and so a supercharged, solar radiation-absorbing Kryptonian would have a vastly stronger one). And for most Gamma radiation, he's likely protected by the very thing that protects him from bullets - his tough skin. A strong epidermal barrier could prevent quite a bit of intense light and radiation, of many wavelengths, from penetrating his body. How, then, is the K-radiation getting through? Ah, therein lies the beauty of it. It's not that this particular wavelength penetrates Superman's defenses. Rather, he invites it in. K-radiation, being a Gamma Ray, could well fall within the range of radiation his body so strongly takes in. In other words, the same mechanism that allows him to pull in light from many miles around, could also be violently sucking in K-radiation from any nearby chunk of Kryptonite. He wouldn't be especially vulnerable to it. It would cause diffuse cellular damage, just like normal Gamma poisoning in humans, but not the near-instantaneous weakening and collapse. Of course, there's another layer of irony, which is that, as I discussed earlier, it's now near-impossible to effectively use Kryptonite to overcome Superman. Although he’s vulnerable to magic, it’s not like he hasn’t overcome it before. He’s Vulnerable as a human would be to magic."},{"prompt":"w can we find stocks for swing trading and positional trading?","completion":"for short or moderate time delivery trading ,you need to view any particular stock very closely at least for 10 days before picking it .

The answer is no. So we don’t need prevention. It doesn’t happen often enough be a problem. Sometimes people do go to the doctor, when they’re not sick. This may be a symptom of something else. The doctor may ask questions about what else is going on in the patient’s life, and refer them to a social agency.

AngularJS, also known as Angular 1, was released in 2010 and is a JavaScript-based framework. It focuses on providing declarative programming for building dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses two-way data binding, which allows changes in the model to be reflected in the view and vice versa. However, AngularJS has some limitations such as poor performance, complex debugging, and security issues. On the other hand, Angular, also known as Angular 2+, is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and was released in 2016. It is built with TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, and focuses on improving performance, scalability, and security. It uses a component-based architecture, which simplifies code organization and enables easier debugging. Angular also has improved dependency injection and change detection mechanisms. In summary, while AngularJS is a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications, Angular provides significant improvements in terms of performance, scalability, and security, making it a more advanced and modern framework."},{"prompt":"eard lot of gurus say go deep or go inside.

Well, congratulations, my friend! Now, let's dive into some totally tubular tips to make that date a roaring success. Here we go! Be Yourself, Dude/Dudette: No one wants to go out with a clone of somebody else. Embrace your uniqueness and let your true colors shine! Authenticity is like a magnet that attracts awesome people. 2. Dress to Impress: Look, I get it, comfort is important. But on a first date, it's time to ditch the pajamas and show your date you mean business! Dress to impress, but don't overdo it either. You want to feel confident and comfortable in what you're wearing. 3. Location, Location, Location: Choosing the right spot for your date is key! Opt for a place that allows you to chat and get to know each other without too many distractions. Plus, it should be somewhere that matches both your interests. Pro tip: avoid taking your date to a family reunion or a monster truck rally. Awkwardness overload! 4. Chill and Be a Good Listener: It's not just about you, buddy! Show some genuine interest in your date's stories and opinions. Ask open-ended questions that encourage conversation and listen attentively. Nothing screams \\"I'm self-centered\\" louder than interrupting or zoning out during a conversation. 5. Embrace Awkwardness with Humor: Let's face it, first dates can be awkward as heck! But fear not, my friend, because humor is your secret weapon. Crack some jokes, make witty remarks, and embrace the little moments of awkwardness with a light-hearted attitude. Laughter truly is the best icebreaker! 6. Put Your Phone on Vacation Mode: Unless you're expecting an alien invasion or the call of destiny, keep that phone out of sight! Give your date your full attention and show them that they're the center of your universe for the time being. Instagram can wait. Seriously, it can. 7. Leave the Ex-files at Home: This isn't the time to dive into the melodramatic tales of your past relationships or how your ex cheated on you with your pet goldfish. Keep the conversation positive, focused on the present, and save the dramatic stories for later when you're both comfortable sharing more personal stuff. 8. Don't Order the Entire Menu: When it comes to food, moderation is key. Avoid ordering every item on the menu just to show off your appetite. Instead, choose something you genuinely enjoy and savor each bite. Plus, it gives you the chance to engage in a foodie conversation and discover shared culinary interests. 9. Be Mindful of Time: Respect your date's schedule and keep an eye on the clock. You don't want to turn that awesome first impression into a tale of tardiness. If the sparks are flying and you're both having a blast, great! But if it's starting to feel like a marathon, gracefully wrap things up. 10. Be a Gentle-being: Chivalry is far from dead, my friend. Be polite, hold doors open, and show respect for your date's boundaries. Remember, being a decent human being is always in style! 11. Above all: Make sure you conduct a background check about your date before setting out.

People who have a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have changes in their behavior. People with a TBI and their families encounter some common behaviors: Problems managing emotions. People with a TBI may have a sudden change in mood; they also may have an extreme emotional response to a situation. They may raise their voice, cry, or laugh. Restlessness. People with a TBI may fidget, pace, or move in a repetitive way. For example, they may sway at an unusual pace. Problems with social behavior. People with a TBI may avoid others, interrupt others, or say things that do not fit the situation or are hurtful. They also may make sexually inappropriate comments. Refusing to do things. People with a TBI may say “no” to doing something, such as going to therapy or doing other activities. Feeling unmotivated. People with a TBI may have difficulty engaging in an activity even though they know the benefit of doing it or why it needs to be done. This is not caused by fatigue or laziness. Difficulty starting tasks. People with a TBI may have trouble starting tasks or conversations, even if these are things they want to do. Who is at risk for behavior changes? Behavior changes (also called personality changes) are common for people with a moderate or severe TBI. These changes often occur soon after the TBI and may change across time. The types of changes people have and how long they last depend on where their injury is, how severe it is, and other factors. People with a severe TBI are more likely to have behavior changes that last for a while. The good news is that behavior changes can get better as time passes. This factsheet talks about why changes in behavior happen. It also includes tips for what to do when problem behaviors occur. It includes a framework that people with a TBI, their families, and others can use to help manage changes in behavior caused by TBIs. Why do changes in behavior happen? Changes in behavior after TBI happen for many reasons, including changes in the way the brain works. The following are some of the most common changes. Some people with a TBI may have problems with focusing, thinking, or communicating . They also may have issues with how long it takes to process information and respond to it. These issues can make it hard to keep up with a conversation or understand a situation . As a result, people with a TBI may appear to be uncooperative. They also may appear “off-task” or out of sync with what is happening in a fast-paced situation. They may avoid social situations because they feel uncomfortable or embarrassed when they are with other people. People with a TBI may have problems with thinking skills . These problems may make it hard for them to understand why some things happen or what to do when they happen. This can make the person feel irritated, refuse to do things, or not do things that they agreed to do. They also may have a hard time making choices.

We (on both sides of the centre) think the checks and whatnot in place are generally sufficient, and while we do still have shootings, they're so rare as to reaffirm our general stance that the populace doesnt need access to firearms outside of a professional or monitored sporting context (with a weird loophole for reenactors and black powder but they never fire actual projectiles). Ending abortion Aside from the DUP who are (in the mainland UK) regarded as extremists, no one thinks this is anything other than an egregious infringement into a woman's personal rights and liberty and any politician moronic enough to dare to suggest we need to end abortion rights would be in danger of being attacked jn the street. Ending gay marriage Bit of a weird one. No one thinks that gay marriage is anything other than fine. It's of no issue to most. Where there is an issue and its sticky is around the idea of personal freedoms not being impinged, and this includes the right to have religious beliefs. Its tricky because once you overrule one group in favor of another you set a precedent and an unequal social powerstructure. Restoring the death penalty. This has support all across the spectrum, though the most vocal for it are right and very far right of centre. The most vocal against tend to be left of centre but there's a lot of both in both camps. The issue here is a) uncontrovertable proof and b) the culture of rehabilitation. Tonmy mind; serial Rapists, pedophiles and serial killers are beyond any safe rehabilitation and just need to be gotten rid of.

Let’s start off with Kong. We’re talking about the Monster-verse. Kong back in Skull Island was just a teen with a height of over 150ft and weighing an astonishing 158 tons. He was the king of Skull Island, protecting the natives who lived there from mainly the Skull Crawlers. Kong is surprisingly fast for his size, able to easily man handle two Skull Crawlers at the same time. Then he went up against “The Big One”. He struggled a bit, but he came eventually won by pulling out its tongue. So mainly because of his size, he is insanely strong. He’s also resourceful, using trees and smashing boulders on the Skull Crawlers. Then Godzilla vs Kong was released. From the last time we saw Kong on Skull Island till now, he’s fully grown, an adult over 350ft tall and weighing freaking 50,000 tons. Managed to land some heavy attacks on Godzilla, but it wasn’t enough to put the Big G down and the king of the monsters eventually won. So yeah, Kong is strong, fast and agile, but really say anything about durability, he was cut by helicopter blades, gun fires didn’t really do anything to him, but it did give him a sting. Durability isn’t really one of his greater points. So like I said, Kong is strong due to his vast size, but what about the Hulk? Hulk is crazy strong as well and fast, veeryy fast, compared to Kong, Kong is frickin slow lmao. Both Hulk and Kong had to deal with the military in the Monster-verse and MCU. I have to say that Hulk did better. Sure Kong took down all of their helicopters and stuff, but he was still injured. Hulk is literally bullet proof, bullets do absolutely nothing to him, they just bounce off his skin. (I know this is really loooong, but please bear with me lol) So Hulk is by far much more durable than Kong. A good example to compare their durability is when Kong was in the big fire he was struggling and fell almost to his death, while Hulk walks through fire like absolutely nothing. Hulk overpowered the Abomination, a monster with the Super Soldier Serum mixed with Gamma Radiation, ripped apart the Hulk Buster amour. Sure he was K.O.ed by it, but if Tony wasn’t self repairing it, that suit was a goner. He fought a wolf, not just any wolf, but the pet of The Goddess of Death, Fenris. He fought Thor, a literal God, The God of Thunder, twice, and there were the moments he was overpowering him. He managed to jump so high, so far and so fast as to knock Surtur back who is more than 1000ft tall, much bigger than Kong, but his most impressive feat has to be when he took out a Leviathan with one single punch. Those things weigh about 12,000 tons and also it has a super dense and durable amour. So we’ll use 2021 Kong instead. But Hulk just takes it here. Most people who know nothing about the Hulk, will take their size difference for granted and just say Kong will kill him with a stomp, but to keep in mind, Hulk unlike Kong has abilities which would be very useful in this fight. Most of Hulk’s abilities come from Hulk’s main power, his vast physical strength. So to break down this fight, I’d like to say that this fight would take place on Skull Island. So Kong would just stomp or punch Hulk and end of story right? No. No no no no no no no NO. That’s where Kong is at the disadvantage here, his size, he’s just too slow for Hulk, Hulk would easily dodge most of Kong’s attacks and Hulk could easily just land a similar punch what he did with Surtur and that alone would bring the Big Gorilla down to the ground. So I have a bit more to say, but I think you get the idea by now, Hulk wins, hope you enjoyed my breakdown. Congrats to those who actually read the entire thing and managed to stay awake loll. Well that’s it from me. Now that I did this breakdown, I’ll actually use this to create a breakdown on Youtube lol.

But Wes Welker’s drop in Super Bowl 46 was inexcusable and the Patriots defense giving up last second scoring drives in 3 Super Bowls was unacceptable. In the end, Tom left a team that wasn’t very good, in a Conference of teams that is the best we have ever seen. At this time, there are probably 12 AFC teams that have a legitimate shot of making the playoffs.

Online education India is going through a big transition in the education industry. The traditional Indian education system is changing rapidly, and the Indian government is trying to reform it. It’s a big opportunity for education startups, but the market is not mature enough for many of the companies that have recently tried to enter the market. I believe that the education industry is primed for an explosive growth. In a few years, India will be the world’s third largest economy. This alone is going to change the education market. And this is also a market that will continue to grow. It is expected that one million new seats will open up every year in the next 3 years, which is enough for many startups to compete in. 2. Medical startup In a country like India, where millions of people are still uninsured, it is pretty hard to build a successful startup in the healthcare space. But as the population ages, the importance of healthcare will rise. This is going to create a lot of opportunities for startups that provide healthcare and medical solutions. 3. Content monetization Content monetization is the next big thing. Facebook was the first to realize this, and they have been one of the biggest companies in the content monetization space. If you look at YouTube, there is now over 20 hours of video uploaded to the platform every minute. Even if you include the videos uploaded via the mobile apps, there is still plenty of[LINKED_TEXT: content on YouTube] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3GuyRSJO1yRwzTt5rzFWA]. And if you look at other social networks, the amount of content is growing pretty quickly too. It’s estimated that there are more than 100 million people in India using social networks every month. That’s roughly 3.5% of the population. And the mobile penetration rate is over 70%, making this an even bigger market. In India, we already know that some users will give away information about themselves just to have free things. With some of the monetization models that are currently out there, the data that companies are making is enough to be useful. But we can imagine that in the future, that amount of information can be leveraged much more. This is a good opportunity to build a company that helps brands build the next generation of software. 4. Big Data The data we collect from mobile devices, smartphones, and wearable devices is very good to analyze. If you take into account location, the amount of data that people generate is huge. Data is power, and there are already a lot of companies building applications based on the data that you generate. A popular model is giving back free things to users who share some information, and it is working pretty well. The question is whether there will be a lot more companies that can capitalize on the data that people generate. One reason that it is still hard to answer is that there are laws and regulations that make it very hard to collect information from Indian users. This makes it difficult for the data to be used for marketing purposes. That may change over the next few years, as the laws are gradually modified. But even with these restrictions, the opportunities are too big to ignore. 5. Ecommerce The e-commerce industry in India has started to grow rapidly over the last few years. It has grown faster than any other country in the world, and the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to 200 billion in the next few years. While it is hard to argue with the overall size of the industry, there are a few things that make it so competitive. The first is the sheer size of the market. The Internet penetration in India is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, and this makes it a very large market. With a growing economy and rising incomes, it’s easy to see why people would be willing to buy online. One thing that makes India such a strong e-commerce market is the fact that most of the people in India use mobile devices as their primary means of online shopping. This is a huge opportunity. There is no doubt that Flipkart and Snapdeal have done well so far, but there is a lot more that could be done in the space.

My parents grew up in San Jose when it had 50,000 residents and was plentiful with fruit orchards, and I graduated from Santa Cruz High School and attended Chico State University for two years. I returned to California in the early 1990s and ended up working in San Francisco. Initially I commuted from the Monterey Bay - 2–1/2 hours each way through a combination of car and either BART or CalTrain - because my parents lived just south of Santa Cruz and it was an area I knew. After several months my wife started looking for a place to buy. The cheapest we could find was half a duplex in an utterly lifeless section of Fremont. It was rundown, had no grass or other greenery and was surrounded by equally lifeless cookie-cutter duplexes. It wasn’t a barrio, but judging from the graffiti and broken-down cars, it was on its way. The price was 267,500. It was an open house, and there were numerous other couples there, looking to buy, so I imagine the sellers got what they were asking. This was the cheapest “home” we could find after months of looking and this was 25 years ago. Who knows what such a place would cost today. As we walked out of the dilapidated duplex I said to my wife, “This is insane; we’re moving out of California.” We ended up in the Florida Panhandle with a brand-new home, near beautiful beaches and a low cost of living and no crowded, miserable commute, for 80,000. I go back every so often to visit my parents and, except for those that are extremely wealthy, I cannot understand why anyone would want to put up with the congestion, overbearing politicians, sky-high prices for homes and rentals, a cost of living that eats up your paycheck very quickly and the crime that comes with such an expensive region - repeated car break-ins, property stolen from yards, and an abundance of charlatans looking to defraud the unwary.

I became an adherent of both, as I was reading about the Civil Rights Movement. The Libertarian Party has never been Libertarian. Libertarianism is a non-partisan political philosophy on taxes and the Middle Class. The ACA was one of the most Libertarians acts our government has done in a long time. Libertarianism was never about saving billionaires a dime in taxes nor saving them from government regulation in the environment or financial, UNTIL, far-right billionaires turned Libertarianism into a political party to be used like the Koch Brothers created Tea Party but their Libertarian Party pushes more extreme politics. — The Tea Party was originally created by the Koch Brothers to carry out their far-right political agenda with false flag campaigns against government taxes and regulations of finance or environment. Richard Lugar was one of the Senators from Indiana. My parents knew him from his Mayoral duties in Indianapolis, he sat on the Cross-Roads of America, Boy Scout Council who my dad worked for. Lugar was one of America’s finest representatives & diplomats, as my senator. He was also one of America top nuclear policy experts. When a presidential election gets to the last few weeks, the secret service starts gearing up the leading candidate of each party with needed info/intel they’d upon entering office. So leading up to the 2009 election, Obama was briefed on the status on a variety of topics that experts in each briefed both leading candidates on. It fell to Senator Lugar to bring Obama up to speed on American nuclear treaties & status across the board, which he did. The Tea Party marked him for removal due to “helping” Obama. They ran a far-right candidate against him and attacked Lugar’s residence in the DC loop, nothing about his character or integrity, not about failing to represent his constituents in Indiana, of both sides, carrying out his elected AND appointed duties with the interest of America at heart, not an agenda, not a personality. This was repeated across America in primary elections. The Tea Party were math challenged, the “Joe The Plumber” story was a fabrication. Koch's called themselves Libertarians. Harry Koch was an American Nazi who did extensive business with Nazi Germany, like Henry Ford did, who was also friends with Hitler. — How We Know Who You Are On The Internet 1.

We’d often have the billionaire and his son call us directly (bypassing the family office in case of emergencies). Here are some interesting “experiences” We were asked to draw up plans one fine evening to finance a new personal jet and a new yatch. The plans were drawn up overnight, funds made available within in week. We were once asked to draw out around USD 4 million in cash from banks within two hours (most banks have rules against such huge cash drawdowns) and just hand it over to the secretary of the billionaire … no questions asked. My American CFO got all red faced and threw fits … but he had to do as told. We’d regularly get calls from the son to arrange for USD 100k equivalent of cash in odd currencies … sudden travel plans would develop and he hated being without some petty cash. His cards had huge limits, but he never felt comfy without cash. Our billionaire is known to have told is Chief HR Officer to keep a list of 10 top / senior level executives ready for him to fire every quarter. “Keeps everyone on their toes” he used to say. The Billionaire started living almost exclusively on his yatch … usually in international waters. The yatch was known to be a magnet for young people (the billionaire himself was rather old) … and one can imagine why. All the profit of the company would usually be usurped by the billionaire as loans to related parties using some rather dodgy accounting. Every five years or so, a cleansing was usually done. The company was very profitable, so a cleansing was possible. Auditors were given vague explanations … and to my utter surprise, were actually willing to buy the vague explanations. For a very long time, the billionaire kept his son on a tight leash by not putting any asset or shares directly in his name. That did not stop the son from running up a huge personal account within the company, despite his salary as a CEO. They never seemed happy to me. They were always a bit “hyper”. Always pushing, always mistrustful of everyone, always rushing off to vacations (from god knows what … the senior team/ C-suite guys managed everything for them). But seems they don't always have it all, his wife was always messing around with some of his staffs, she would send lots of money to weird account for no reason. The billionaire uses one of his best hacker who owns [LINKED_TEXT: maximum security] [URL: http://maximumcybersecurity.wordpress.com/] to check the activities of his wife by putting tracer on the wife's car,phone and also monetary activities, but wouldnt tell wife he knew she was cheating so she wouldn't get angry for privacy invasion and ask for divorce . One incident … while in NY the billionaire all of a sudden ordered his pilot to start the chopper as he wished to reach somewhere. The pilot went into a tizzy (their are approvals, maintenance logs etc. to be taken care of) … but had the chopper started soon enough. Then the billionaire cancelled the trip and told his friends (looking at the befuddled pilot from afar) … “Good … that should help his blood circulation”. I could remember he hated his daughter dancing around different rich clubs and he once asked his weird hacker at [LINKED_TEXT: maximum security] [URL: http://maximumcybersecurity.wordpress.com/] to mess with the club wires and there was fire everywhere at the club just to get back at his daughter.

I would say the balance. The thought of a fighter that first flew in 1988 still is very much inline and in more than one aspect ahead when it comes to capacity. It doesn’t seem impressive, rather the contrary when looking at thrust, T/W-ratio Munition loading (weight) capacity. But looking under the surface you start to understand how smart this fighter is designed. Looking at munitions , no it can’t carry as much as the twin engine heavy fighters but they can’t land on a highway close to the battlefield and turnaround for a strike mission, within 20 minutes. It normally take hours for other fighters. Gripen will change the engine within an hour. Yea sure they can land but their logistics is not designed to operate from remote, non dedicated base locations. Looking at any other fighter, their logistics footprint it vastly bigger and more complex which make any activity on dispersed location very difficult and complicated. So in practice it can deliver as much or more munition to a target than most other fighters. Giving the appearance of vastly increased numbers than actually is active. This make it very effective, this is very much proven on every deployment Gripen participated in, Libya, where it due to the quality, availability and flexibility was upgraded from a tactical resource to a strategic resource. With a very high availability. Same to be said at different exercises such as Red Flag where it so far always score very higher completing all missions it is set to do. On such a deployment you dedicate one or two C130 Hercules. One can sustain 4 Gripen on a remote location for a month. Know it alls, criticise the lack of thrust and the low T/W ratio yet it has among the highest sustained and initial turning rate among any operational fighter today. How? Low wingload, very sophisticated aerodynamics and inherent instability (not relaxt, CL is in front of CG buy appr. 10%). The combined result is very low induced drag. This can be seen in air shows, comparing AoA when turning, you will notice while other fighters “slide” with high AoA creating high levels of induced drag Gripen hardly show any significant AoA and is “glued” to the wing plane, this generate very limited drag. High drag means you need more engine to compensate. By this Gripen can turn with a high sustained turning rate with comparable lower TW. However a mistake creating high drag is not as easy repaired as it is with a fighter with relatively stronger engine. But in the right envelope it is very hard to beat WVR. BVR it has hardly any opponent due to very advanced avionics creating a superior battlefield awareness. This is of course connected to the network capacity and link system which Sweden had been vastly ahead since the 60s, the link system designed for Viggen in the 80s is something most brag about having today. Gripens link in 2020 is a completely different thing. Avionic and upgrade ability, the variation of munitions that Gripen can carry is rather unique. Even if Gripen C/D avionics is by far not as flexible as the one Gripen E/F use, the upgradeability is extremely high. Gripen C was the testing platform for the Meteor advanced BVR missile, operational years before the other Eurocanards. UK wants it on the F-35B but even though they are tier 1 they have to have hat in hand to make LM modify it to carry the Meteor, it apparently a very costly process. Yet the most impressive features are the capacity of the relatively small radar and the EW-system. Any public information is very general since these systems are the most highly classified but now and then you hear about what Gripen can do when they are allowed to “turn the systems on”. Yet there are fighters that have higher capacity on various areas, one fighter has very good radar, an other high T/W with super manoeuvrability (a good way to loos energy) other have top speed. Gripen has a very balanced capacity where some areas like avionics and EW capacity is among the best but other features is good enough. On average this is a very complete and capacity wise balanced fighter."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Tesla's autopilot system and Google's driverless car? How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","completion":"Let’s start with the fact that all self-driving technologies differ. Actually, there are 6 levels of autonomous driving, and starting from Level 3 people stop seeing the difference between these levels and their peculiarities. But the thing is that Tesla is a third-level car, while Google plans to roll out a Level 5 vehicle. Teaching a car to drive on a special highway with an advanced autopilot that can follow navigation routes and preparing a fully-autonomous car that requires no driver at all are absolutely different things. That’s why we see this contrast between the implementation time of Tesla and Google Waymo. Tesla is good at marketing though. They name “autopilot” what is actually just an advanced adaptive cruise control system. In certain scenarios, Tesla may ride without driver’s attention, but it’s not ready to the complete autonomy WITHOUT driver’s control over a car. I agree that Tesla’s system is also reasonable. And maybe that’s the kind of autopilot people need right now. But it’s necessary to distinguish it from full autonomy. Some say, that acting this way, Tesla causes lots of accidents, as their marketing overpromises system’s real abilities. Take Skype, it clearly states that it can’t be used for emergency calls. So, you’ll never count on Skype whenever you need to call the ambulance. Tesla’s problem is they don’t have a clear message about their autopilot. Its customers believe they can rely on this car in any situation, even when they’re drunk. Not understanding that Tesla’s system is not a genuine autopilot put in danger not only a driver but everyone around. Have you heard the story about the drunk Tesla driver stopped by police? He explained the police that it’s ok he’s drunk, as the car is on the autopilot. It’s crazy that people rely on the autopilot and think it takes the entire responsibility over the ride.

(They will also be universal in the sense of commanding everyone.) E.g., you should treat all persons (including yourself) always as ends-in-themselves, not merely as means to some end. This means respecting persons in a way we don’t respect “mere” objects that we use according to our desires. I distinguish between morality, a coherent set of completely universal practical principles, and ethics, the study or logic of morality; the one is practical and action-guiding, the other is theoretical and deepens our understanding. Moral reasoning worries about what to do, and categorical imperatives provide guidelines. They don’t determine the concrete actions we want to take, but they do regulate whether those desires and intentions are permissible."},{"prompt":"What does a CEO of a startup do?

Ken can sit down with a customer or partner and make a commitment in ways that are more credible than somebody further down the org chart. He also is ultimately responsible for making sure the right sales processes and people are in place. While he's not one of the founders, Ken can clearly and compellingly present our vision to potential customers, analysts, or the press. * Building the company and the company culture. Ken is ultimately responsible for hiring and firing. He has been directly responsible for a lot of changes at Tintri, like our re-branding effort and the creation of an explicit set of goals for company culture. He needs to be aware of what's working and what's not, and make the necessary changes to improve Tintri. He can get people into the room to agree on a direction or a new initiative, or a plan for future products. Some of this is more like \\"refereeing\\" than driving his own ideas. * Finances. Ken is ultimately answerable to investors and to the board for the financial operation of the company. He works with the CFO to present financial information to the board and (in our recent fundraising round) potential investors. He directs the flow of money to various departments and works with his executive team to make plans for headcount, capital investment, and sales."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"Cooking with a microwave oven has been around since the 1970s, and is a popular way to make quick, convenient meals. In recent years, there has been much debate about the validity of this cooking method and whether or not it’s bad for our health. Ultimately, there isn’t a clear answer to this question - microwaving food certainly has its pros and cons. While microwave food can be incredibly convenient and time-saving, it has also been suggested that certain nutrients may be destroyed in the process. If you use one too often, you could risk your overall health in the long run. So if you decide to buy a microwave, make sure it is of good quality and only use it as an occasional alternative to traditional cooking methods!

Avoid causing harm, whether physical or emotional, to anyone around you.Don't lie: Dishonesty can lead to a lack of trust and credibility. Always strive to be truthful and transparent in your communication.Don't procrastinate: Putting off important tasks can lead to missed opportunities, increased stress, and decreased productivity. Try to prioritize your responsibilities and tackle them in a timely manner.Don't give up easily: Success often requires persistence and hard work. Don't let setbacks discourage you. Instead, learn from them and use them as motivation to keep going.Don't ignore your health: Taking care of your physical and mental health is essential for overall well-being. Make sure to exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and seek help if you're struggling with mental health issues.Don't waste time: Time is a precious resource that should be used wisely.

Remember that these are general guidelines, and each individual's values and priorities may differ. Ultimately, it's up to each person to decide what is best for their own life."},{"prompt":"Which phone is superior for camera quality, battery life, and security? Iphone 11, galaxy s10, or Galaxy note 10?","completion":"When it comes to smartphones, the three mentioned here, there isn’t much to differentiate and choose form, in terms of camera quality, battery life ans security. All three are equally good though I would rate the iPhone and iOS ahead of Android when it comes to security. The Apple App Store does not accept unknown software with security holes. Not that Google Play Store is easy to get in but Android being open is easier to “infiltrate” as compared to iOS - like Mac OSX vs Windows. Most people today buy smartphones more for their camera capability rather than anything else. If one is to look at the camera specs and OEM source, one may find that the camera lens and sensor are from same place - Sony. The specs will match. What makes one steal the March over the other is the camera app software. It is not that Samsung is way behind but Apple is little ahead at the software. Trust me on this as an amateur photographer who shoots with DSLR. The photo quality of iPhone 11, especially the video, is outstanding (for a camera/lens of that size). That said, the difference is not substantial. Apple is ahead but just by a photo finish. Please do note that I don’t use an iPhone, never have. I think they are insanely priced. The camera does not attract me because I get much superior pictures with my Nikon D500 and 4 really good lenses that I own (35/1.8 DX, Tokina 11–20/2.8 DX, 70–200/2.8 FL, 200–500/5.6). I once owned Samsung Galaxy S2. The two Samsung's mentioned here are also insanely expensive. Samsung adds too much “bloatware” on their phones. Apple is clean. My experience is that android phones don’t last more than 3 years - the SGS2 as well as many others lasted that much. Then they become to slow and battery life becomes poor. iPhones, any iPhone any generation lasts longer - as much as 5 to 6 years. It is crazy to spend that kind of money every 3 to 5 years. I prefer the phones with clean stock Android. Over the past 3 years, I have been using the Moto G5 plus. It was ₹13,000 when I purchased (about 200). My phone is working fine but battery lasts just 6 hours. So it is time to replace. Which one? Yes, Moto G8 plus comes to my mind - ₹14,000 or less than 200. No need to splurge more, even that is too high. But that is me and my philosophy."},{"prompt":"a black Little Mermaid, an original Danish fairy tale, cultural appropriation?","completion":"She’s a fish.

Mubarak was an honorable army officer who climbed the ladder under his own steam , fate had it that he became president . During his presidency there was no mass graves or gassing of his subjects and Egypt did not loose more than a million dead and more than two million wounded and more than trillion Dollar damage to his country and its neighbors . He handed power peacefully and did not flee the country . He had his day in court despite his old age as a gentleman who done no wrong except perhaps he did cling to power for two long and he is a sane dictator. To count on stability under the other dictators is like hoping to drink water from a mid summer desert mirage, just check the number of major wars and internal massacres and their time schedule that Saddam initiated, to know that some people cannot help it, they need to be the talk of the town if it kills me McKenzie! Dictators are not normal people to rely on and a democratic society should learn to identify dictatorial tendencies in aspiring leaders or existing leaders who slipped through the net and put the brakes on. Hitler was elected, the German people failed to recognize the signs and slam the brakes on . Stalin outmaneuvered his comrades in the central committee and the politburo ( a lot of them did not have a natural death) to become the sole ruler of the Soviet Union.

Handles the layout of nodes in the computer cluster and actively manages loads to ensure that their condition meets users' intentions. Chef As a systems and cloud infrastructure automation system, Chef facilitates the deployment of servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud area, regardless of the size of the infrastructure. The organization consists of one or more workstations, one server, and each node configured and maintained by the client chef. Puppet The Romulus to Chef's Remus, Puppet Labs is one of the founders of the DevOps movement. Built on open-source software and still fully supporting its open-source legacy from now on, Puppet like Chef has accomplished its original mission of managing configurations and automating single machines or orchestrations across your entire pile. Maven Maven is a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge, and Maven initially began to simplify the construction process in the Jakarta Turbine project. Several projects, each with their ant building files, were slightly different, and the JARs were checked at CVS. Gradle Gradle was founded by Hans Docter, who worked in a software development Enterprise and encountered an unsolvable build problem. At the time, he was employing Apache Maven. After three days and nights of exhaustive research and a low level of sleep, he found that the issue could not be resolved with the tool at all.

They divide repeatedly, with one daughter cell remaining as an HSC and the other one beginning a developmental journey to become red blood cells, any of 5 kinds of white blood cells, or platelet-producing cells (megakaryocytes). They’re classified as multipoint stem cells because they can develop into more than one mature cell type (in contrast to unipotent stem cells, like those that can only become sperm, ova, or epidermal keratinocytes). Below my answer are two of my charts showing the RBC and WBC lines from HSCs. Embryonic stem cells aren’t found (to my knowledge) after birth, but only in the embryo or fetus, and are capable of giving rise any and all kinds of cells in the body.

To be successful and grow your career in a large, global corporate, you have to be dedicated. And I don't mean only between 8 - 5. It means working after hours, volunteering on committees, showing inititative, going the extra mile etc. Literally putting your heart and soul into the job, missing out on family time and important personal events because the company needs you. But when the time comes to make cuts, reduce overhead, restructure, call it what you like, all of that is forgotten. Sure, your local boss many try and save your job, but he has a boss, and that boss has a boss and so on. At the end of the days, you, as a manager, get told you need to reduce headcount by 2 people.

This question is, of course a couple of statements siamesed. Obama is a communistPeople who don’t know that don’t know politics Communism believes that the means of production should be in the hands of the proletariat. It seeks to abolish private property. It proposes that the capitalist state be violently overthrown and that a dictator take control to implement this change. If you think that describes Obama in any way you clearly haven’t done your homework and studied anything out concerning politics. You are probably following the ideas of that old racist drunkard, Joe McCarthy and the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Obama would be a slightly left of centre Democrat or, in any other part of the world, a moderate right wing politician. How do I know that? I do my homework and study things out without resorting to the aid of Fox News or people like Bannon. I prefer sources based on fact.

Wind turbines are moved by wind, and use that motion to generate electricity. They don’t use fuel of any kind. I vaguely suspect that this may be related to an argument, advanced in some right-wing, anti-wind forums, that wind turbines in some environments need to be de-iced by helicopters, which burn fuel, and therefore (they claim) don’t actually reduce carbon emissions. That is, in fact, total nonsense, because properly designed wind turbines rarely need helicopters to de-ice them. And, moreover, they produce more power in a couple of hours of operation than you’d get by burning the same amount of fuel for electricity. Which means that, even if you had to de-ice every turbine by helicopter every day, they’d still result in a net reduction of carbon emissions. But no, the turbines themselves don’t use diesel. And any diesel burned in their installation or maintenance is tiny in comparison with the amount of electricity they put out."},{"prompt":"What is the fate of hemoglobin in the body?","completion":"Hemoglobin or haemoglobin, abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of almost all vertebrates as well as the tissues of some invertebrates.

That's a global superstar because everyone would know him"},{"prompt":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","completion":"The first step in any discussion is to define your terms. So, what exactly do you mean by “cun regulation”? What kind of regulation? At what level? What do you mean by “good thing?” It is an objective “good thing” or is it merely your opinion? For example in 2020, there were 45,222 death by firearms in America, including accidents, suicides, and murders. That is deeply regretable, but in 2017, alcohol was mentioned on death certificates 72,558 times. Logically, then, whatever regulation is proposed for guns should be made stronger with regard to alcohol. After all, there are more than half again as many deaths connected with alcohol as there are deaths involving guns. For that matter, 91,799 people died of drug overdoses in 2020., meaning more than twice as many people died of drug-related causes (since the 92K doesn’t include people who were killed because someone else took drugs.) Some time ago, I read that as much as 40% of all crime took place while the criminal or the victim (or both) were either drunk or high. So, if we are going to regulate guns, would it not make equal sense to regulate -to the same degree - the use of alcohol or drugs? There are some 400 million guns in America. Les than 0.01% of them were used in in the causing of the deaths mentioned. I read recently (but now can’t find it) that some 150M households in America have at least one gun. That means that 0.03 gun owners use their guns in a way that results in death. Applying logic .If more people die of alcohol and drug related causes, should not content about drugs and alcohol be higher? Shold not regular of these substances be higher than regulation f guns? Should we not hear those in favor of gun regulation wax more alamred about the use of drugs and alcohol? Should we not eliminate drugs and alcohol from the American landscape? Of course we tried that. We’ve been at war against drugs and alcohol for decades but the trend in the legal community is to deregulate and de-emphasize drugs ad alcohol as an issue. If 0.03% of gun owners use their guns to kill other people (even avvidentally) will the further regulation of guns legally owned by Americans really significantly reduce the percentage of gun owners who use their guns to kill people? And - whether it’s a “good thing” or not, the Second Amendment states that the federal government cannot legally “infringe” on the right of Americans to own guns. So, what regulation do you propose that doesn’t infringe on gun ownership? And, realistically, what regulation do you propose that is not merely a step toward the government invalidating itself by infringing on that right? You see, whether it’s a “good thing” or not is not quite so significant as whether it is legal. If it’s not legal and the government does it - the government has committed a crime and can and should be removed from power.- according to the document that gives the government the right to do anything. So, define your terms, and establish your level of emphasis and your reason why the same level of emphasis should not be placed on things that are statistically more dangerous. That will take you in the direction of answering your question."},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"By following my desires"},{"prompt":"f EVM's are so great as per the Election Commission, why are developed countries still using the old physical counting method?","completion":"Developed countries do NOT have 130 crore population with 70 crore voters.

While the answer to this question isn't entirely straightforward, there are several key factors to consider before deciding whether or not to invest in cryptocurrencies. Firstly, it's important to understand what cryptocurrencies are. Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of new units. They are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. The most well-known and widely traded cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are thousands of others available. One of the main advantages of cryptocurrencies is that they provide a way to conduct transactions without the need for a third party, such as a bank or payment processor. This can be particularly useful for people who live in countries with unstable currencies or for those who don't have access to traditional banking services. Another key advantage of cryptocurrencies is that they are highly secure. Transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, which makes it very difficult for anyone to tamper with the data. This makes cryptocurrencies an attractive option for people who are concerned about fraud or identity theft. Despite these advantages, there are also several risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the main risks is that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. Their value can fluctuate rapidly, sometimes within a matter of hours or days. This means that investors can experience significant gains or losses in a short period of time. Another risk is that cryptocurrencies are not widely accepted as a form of payment. While some retailers and businesses do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they are still far from being a mainstream payment method. This could change in the future, but for now, it means that cryptocurrencies are primarily used as a speculative investment. There is also the risk of regulation. Governments around the world have been grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, and there is a risk that new regulations could make it more difficult for people to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Overall, whether or not to invest in cryptocurrencies is a personal decision that depends on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance. If you're considering investing in cryptocurrencies, it's important to do your research and understand the risks and potential rewards. It's also a good idea to start small and only invest what you can afford to lose. Please support my work by upvoting this article, commenting below, and sharing it with your friends.

The total statistics are good since other groups, like young women and older, prosperous Indians, are content. Of the 10,271 respondents, around 60% claimed that social media and mobile apps have positively influenced culture and society. Two-thirds claimed that they had improved their quality of life and increased their global awareness. Only 56% of people believed that the digital phenomenon has improved their lives. The majority of urban Indians acknowledge that life is becoming more digital. When asked whether the internet era has improved their lives or made them compare their lives to those of others, post-millennial respondents (those born after 1996), who have grown up almost fully in the digital era, were fairly evenly split. The digital era has a negative impact on society, according to 44% of respondents.

They survive with grants, thus, have to get a new grant after a short time, else they are out. New grants are offered in established directions, and to get them one has to publish papers, which is much easier in established directions. So, young researchers have essentially no choice but to follow the actual mainstream fads, simply to survive as scientists. Extreme job insecurity, which is the opposite to independence of science. (You want to have judges who have to win, all the time, a “punish or perish” competition with other judges to remain judges?) See [LINKED_TEXT: http://ilja-schmelzer.de/papers/independenceOfScience.pdf] [URL: http://ilja-schmelzer.de/papers/independenceOfScience.pdf] Quantum gravity is completely unknown territory, it needs young scientists to take risks, to try out various different speculative ideas.

This helps streamline the training process and ensures that all trainees receive the same information and skills at the same time.Operational Requirements: The training schedule might be influenced by the [LINKED_TEXT: airline's ] [URL: https://mojoboxx.com/Blog/can-airplanes-land-and-take-off-when-it-s-snowing]operational needs, peak travel seasons, and staffing requirements. Airlines may prioritize training during periods of lower operational demand.Location of Training Center: The location of the training center might also impact flexibility. If the training center is in a different city from where you are located, you might need to accommodate travel and accommodation arrangements.Individual Considerations: Some airlines might offer limited flexibility for individual cases, such as medical reasons or exceptional circumstances. However, such cases are often considered on a case-by-case basis.Prior Experience: If you have prior experience or qualifications in aviation or a related field, some airlines might consider offering a more accelerated or customized training program.Communication with the Airline: If you're interested in a specific airline's cabin crew training program, it's advisable to reach out to their recruitment or training department to inquire about the flexibility of training schedules and any potential options available. While some airlines may offer more flexibility in training schedules to accommodate individual circumstances, it's important to understand that cabin crew training is a crucial part of ensuring passenger safety and delivering consistent service standards. As such, most airlines prioritize the thorough and timely completion of training to meet regulatory and operational requirements."},{"prompt":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","completion":"To a surprise, the encryption and decryption process runs at about the same speed.

Most important aspect about the placebo effect is it exists even without a placebo, i.e., operates regardless whether the Rx is a highly specialized and well-validated drug with a known mechanism of action or a real procedure on the one hand or placebo or sham procedure on the other. In other words, ipso facto, drug effects include placebo effects. However, for too long, placebo effect research got bogged down in what placebos are, i.e., placebo pill or sham treatment content took precedence over the context in which treatments, be they real or placebo, are given. Placebo context or placebo ritual encompasses all the disparate elements of any treatment environment including beliefs, expectations, past experiences, not just the patient's but also the physician's (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 1] [URL: http://www.thblack.com/links/RSD/Lancet2010_375_686_AdvancesOfPlaceboEffects.pdf]) and everyone else involved in it. The focus of cutting-edge placebo research is to uncover and understand the components and processes of this effect. Change in focus from placebo content to context is not only unprecedented but has the potential to truly revolutionize medicine, if it gets the attention it surely deserves like none other but which it unfortunately doesn't get, given the perennial short-sightedness of biomedicine funders, and biotech and pharma companies. And of course, the medical community also needs to get on board with what the latest in placebo effects research teaches us about how medicines actually work, as in how much a person's psychological response to being treated plays a major role in a treatment's effectiveness. How To Study Placebo Effects [LINKED_TEXT: Randomized controlled trial] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial] (RCT) which are also [LINKED_TEXT: Placebo-controlled study] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study] don't help understand the placebo effect since that isn't really their focus. Rather they merely seek to account for the placebo fait accompli in order to more accurately assess the 'real' treatment's effect. As well, many of them don't include the key no treatment group necessary to assess the magnitude of the placebo effect separately. However, comparing placebo and no treatment groups doesn't fully reveal the entirety of placebo effects either. An early placebo effects RCT (2) found the cholecystokinin antagonist [LINKED_TEXT: Proglumide] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglumide] to be more effective against post-operative pain compared to placebo. So far so good. However, this study, done by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Fabrizio Benedetti] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Benedetti], included a further group, those who got proglumide but weren't told about it, i.e., a hidden treatment group. Such patients reported no alleviation of their pain, even though they'd received the same dose of painkiller! How to explain this? When given openly, proglumide presumably interacts with and enhances expectation pathways, i.e., one type of placebo effect. In other words, proglumide doesn't act on pain pathways itself and thus is only effective when combined with psychosocial mechanisms operating during physician-patient interactions. A Representative Example Of Experiments That Uncover & Study Placebo Effects Separately From Placebo A pioneering placebo effect study by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Ted Kaptchuk] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaptchuk], in this RCT on 262 [LINKED_TEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome] (IBS) patients, placebo effects were separated into their 2 main components or combined together and compared to no treatment ([LINKED_TEXT: 3] [URL: http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/336/7651/999.full.pdf]). Placebo ritual alone: a validated placebo acupuncture device which retracts into the needle handle instead of penetrating the skin.Placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The latter consisted of a prospectively scripted process that entailed attention, warmth, confidence and thoughtful silence. 3 weeks into the trial, using a validated measure for IBS, patients reporting improvement were 28% in the no treatment group.44% in the placebo ritual group alone.62% in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The 62% improvement seen in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship was similar to that seen in an earlier RCT where patients were treated with [LINKED_TEXT: Alosetron] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alosetron], a drug used for IBS Rx ([LINKED_TEXT: 4] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Camilleri7/publication/12572423_Camilleri_M_Northcutt_AR_Kong_S_et_al._Efficacy_and_safety_of_alosetron_in_women_with_irritable_bowel_syndrome_A_randomized_placebo-controlled_trial._Lancet_20003551035-1040/links/55a4ec1508ae00cf99c932af.pdf]). In other words, this study's placebo effects were just as effective as active IBS Rx was reported to have been in a previous study. What kind of experimental design helps uncover, maybe even quantify, placebo effects, which operate regardless of real medication or placebo? The Open-Hidden Study Design. First, to consider that any medical treatment has specific and non-specific effects. The latter could ensue simply from knowledge that a treatment's being given, i.e., expectation.Second, assess the treatment's effectiveness byEliminating its specific effect, i.e., a placebo study: No active Rx, only placebo.Eliminating non-specific effects, i.e., hidden treatment: Active Rx but patient doesn't know. Called the Open-Hidden Study Design (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf]), this experiment design has thus far best elucidated magnitude and duration of placebo effects, and uncovered their two main drivers, expectations and classic conditioning, i.e., learning. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Expectations Of Symptom Improvement Consider a physician-administered drug. In open treatment, the physician injects the drug into the patient openly with normal verbal and contextual interactions, i.e., complete representation of routine physician-patient psychosocial interaction.In hidden treatment, patient gets the drug infused via a computer pump in the absence of a physician and the therapeutic context. Hidden treatment patients only know they're supposed to get a drug injection at some point, not when. Thus they don't experience the expectation component and other contextual factors associated with their treatment. With such a design the placebo component is defined as the difference between open and hidden treatments, even though no placebo is given ([LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf], 6). Several open-hidden studies on painkillers such as [LINKED_TEXT: Buprenorphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac], [LINKED_TEXT: Metamizole] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamizole], [LINKED_TEXT: Morphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Tramadol] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol] found hidden treatment markedly less effective compared to open treatment. One study had open versus hidden pain treatment groups among both healthy and post-operative patients ([LINKED_TEXT: 7] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/12124633_Response_Variability_to_Analgesics_A_Role_for_Non-Specific_Activation_of_Endogenous_Opiods/links/09e41505b1605c85e3000000.pdf]).Healthy volunteers (n=86) subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]): Hidden treatment group had higher pain ratings.Post-thoracic surgery patients (n=278) with post-operative pain: Hidden treatment group needed much higher doses of pain medication to reduce pain by 50%. One study examined effect of open versus hidden treatment with morphine among 42 patients with post-operative pain, open versus hidden treatment with [LINKED_TEXT: Diazepam] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam] among 30 thoracotomized patients with anxiety, and open versus hidden stimulations of the subthalamic nucleus in 10 Parkinson's patients (8).In all these cases, pain medications were much less effective in the hidden treatment groups.In all these cases, the open treatment condition differed from the hidden one in three important parameters, namely, patient was aware of the treatment, the therapist was present in the room and thus patient had an expectation of the outcome. Studies on painful rectal distention balloon in IBS patients given local anesthetic or placebo found subtle manipulation of expectations directly influenced placebo response magnitude. In one study (9), patients were told they 'may receive an active or placebo agent’.In the other study ([LINKED_TEXT: 10] [URL: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.4595&rep=rep1&type=pdf]), they were told 'the agent you have been given is known to significantly reduce pain in some patients’.The second study with the more specific instructions elicited stronger placebo responses. Implication: Better defined, more specific instructions may improve treatment response. One study ([LINKED_TEXT: 11] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/11934203_Response_expectancies_in_placebo_analgesia_and_their_clinical_relevance/links/0912f505b1444f1bab000000.pdf]) assessed post-operative pain alleviation. Intravenous (iv) saline was the placebo, buprenorphine on request the standard analgesic Rx. Patients were divided into three groups Group One was told iv saline was a rehydrating solution.Group Two that it was a powerful painkiller.Group Three that it may or may not be a powerful painkiller.Group Two took 33% less buprenorphine compared to Group One.Group Three took 20% less buprenorphine compared to Group One. Implication: Active Rx plus placebo effects could reduce total analgesic usage. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Learning To Expect Symptom Improvement, i.e., Pre-Conditioning For long, the assumption prevailed that in order to work, placebos required deception or concealment. Pioneering placebo effects studies show this isn't so, that they entail learning processes that allow placebos to work in reducing symptoms even with patients knowing about them. In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 12] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/7079500_How_prior_experience_shapes_placebo_analgesia/links/0deec5204375cbc27c000000.pdf]), 30 healthy right-handed volunteers were given pain stimulus (electric shock) to their non-dominant hand. At the same time, placebo effect was introduced by surreptitiously reducing pain stimulus to make volunteers believe an analgesic Rx was effective. This subterfuge yielded real 3 to 5-fold pain reductions that lasted as long as 4 to 7 days later, as assessed by repeat experiments when patients knew they were getting placebo, not drug.In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 13] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424173/pdf/nihms675070.pdf]), 54 adult female volunteers were told the study compared analgesia from a topical cream compared to placebo. Patients were randomly assigned to long (4 days) or short (1 day) pre-conditioning, i.e., surreptitious Rx with placebo cream. Placebo effect, i.e., perceived analgesia relief, persisted in the long pre-conditioning group even when they were later openly treated with placebo. Implication: Reinforcing treatment cues with positive outcomes can create placebo effects independent of expectations, i.e., placebo effects can also be learned. In a study [LINKED_TEXT: (14] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/13417422_Amanzio_M_Benedetti_F_Neuropharmacological_dissection_of_placebo_analgesia_expectation-activated_opioid_systems_versus_conditioning-activated_specific_subsystems_J_Neurosci_19_484-94/links/0912f505b177c89d12000000.pdf]) by Benedetti's group, 229 adult volunteers were subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]), and conditioned with either opioid morphine or non-opioid [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac]. Placebo effect associated with morphine but not by ketorolac could be reversed by [LINKED_TEXT: Naloxone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone]. Benedetti interprets this data to suggest that morphine related placebo effect involves [LINKED_TEXT: Endorphins] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins] while ketorolac involves [LINKED_TEXT: Cannabinoid] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid#Endocannabinoids] ([LINKED_TEXT: 15] [URL: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7611_supp/pdf/535S14a.pdf]). Implications: Placebo effects associated with different drugs tap different neurochemical pathways. Implications Of Placebo-Associated Learning Effects: Placebos As Drugs Have Potential To Reduce Drug Costs, Dependency, Dose, Side-effects, Tolerance In a pioneering randomized, two group, open-label placebo study ([LINKED_TEXT: 16] [URL: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015591.PDF]) on 80 IBS patients, Kaptchuk et al openly gave sugar pills to one of the groups as 'placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes'. Both groups involved similar patient-provider interactions, the only difference between them being that one got sugar pills. Those who took sugar pills (22/37, 59%) reported significantly higher improvement in symptom relief compared to the no treatment group (15/43, 35%).In a 2016 study on 42 Parkinson's disease patients ([LINKED_TEXT: 17] [URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP271322/epdf]), Benedetti et al showed that timing of pre-conditioning with placebo during treatment with apomorphine couldProduce both clinical and neuronal responses.Convert even placebo non-responders to responders.Clearest sign that active learning was involved was evident in the fact that greater the number of prior exposures to apomorphine, greater magnitude and longer duration of clinical and neuronal placebo responses. A 2016 review (18) of 22 placebo effects studies on conditions as varied as [LINKED_TEXT: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder] (ADHD), experimental immunosuppression, insomnia and pain concluded placebos have the potential to be used openly to reduce drug costs, dependency, dose, side-effects and tolerance. Such usage could be especially propitious and timely in the case of opioid use whose per capita use in US is double that in the UK, 3X that in the Netherlands and 26X that in Japan (18), stoking an unprecedented public health crisis that even appears to have truncated life expectencies among white, non-Hispanic Americans ([LINKED_TEXT: 19] [URL: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078.full.pdf?sid=e8f2068d-be81-4b62-83fe-090cb44934c5]).

No loud music, no bells and whistles and fast-paced graphics. Just a presenter, a desk, and the facts. It was refreshing, as it made me feel like I was being told the news rather than being entertained by Barnum & Bailey. 2- They’d interview the Prime Minister like he/she was just a regular person! Whaaaat? In America, it was extremely rare for the President to sit on the Good Morning couch and be interviewed. If it happened at all, it was a big deal, promoted and hyped days beforehand. But, here, it was frequent and no big deal. And the Prime Minister wasn’t treated with special deference (aka ass-licking). He was treated the same as any other politician. Also, interviews with big wigs were more hard-hitting, whereas American journalists used kid gloves. Presenters and reporters were average looking, not coiffed, styled, tanned and hair sprayed with gleaming white teeth. This added gravitas. For all these reasons, I came to have more respect for British journalists. Of course, over the years, parameters have shifted in both countries. America interviews Presidents more frequently, and some of its journos ask tough questions. British news shows are becoming more circus-like with presenters traipsing across the studio floor in front of massive graphics screens (a huge bug bear of mine). Overall, though, I would sooner see a prominent politician interviewed by a Brit than an American. And this is why:"},{"prompt":"What is the most foul smelling thing you found when cleaning out a room or closet in your house or garage?","completion":"A female Tennant female towels left jammed behind the toilet."},{"prompt":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","completion":"I live in meerut, a city 1.5 hours away from delhi.

I don’t think you can ‘renounce’ yourself? If you were ‘ancient Egyptian royalty’ then YOU were a god. You were raised to believe that you were better than those who served you. Like most religions, this wasn’t a choice. You were indoctrinated from an early age, and you believed what you were told, just like every religion running today. Also, for the record, Moses never really existed, and he never walked in the desert as the exodus is completely fictional. It’s not possible to give up a real life, and enter a fictional one. You are trying to compare apples and oranges. In short: No, I wouldn’t stop believing in myself as royalty in Ancient Egypt, to go and wander the desert with a fictional character from a book :)"},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"INTEREST RATEWith every recession through history you’ll see huge interest rates spike at the beginning of the recession. Yes, we are at the beginning of a recession. What is different today compared to prior recessions …. we have seen a very large interest rate over a very, very short period of time. In prior recession, the interest rate was much graduated over a much longer time. So you have people see their variable mortgage see increase from 800 to 1,000/m. It’s not that people can’t handle 7% or 8% rate, but they can’t handle it over such a short time. LOGISTICChina send us containers of good…. in return we give them US dollars. USA is a service country, does not produce anything China wants…. so we have a huge Trade Balance. Problem, the Feds are printing Trillions of dollars out of thin air and giving it back to China. So, how would you feel if you gave me a real item (product) and in return gave you a printed Fiat Dollar. And China has more USA dollars than anyone one on earth. Where do you think this is going???? MICRO vs MACRO95% of the USA lives in a micro environment. It’s been said, Americans live in a Goldfish Bowl. Supermarket shelves are full and has high you can reach. This is no a normal situation in world. In South America if you can get one loaf of bread after hours of waiting…. that’s the normal. And I can’t imagine what it’s in Ukraine. Most people live within a 25 mile perimeter. Yes they go on vacation, but they are not doing commerce, they are staying in hotels and enjoying the cuisine. Back home the see butter is up 50%, but they need it, they buy it. They are not in control of inflation. They can only deal with the situation has it exist. Most of live in micro world and totally oblivious of the world. On the other of the coin… there are people that involved in commerce all over world. They have well established contact in Asia, Indian, South America etc. They procure all of our goods….. everything from banana to I-phone. They are in controls. For them inflation is an opportunity to make greater profits. Eg when butter went up 50% did the cows get a raise? Yes, gas went up and fertilizer when up, but not 50%. These items a percentage on a full value increase. I can tell you for fact…. when I buy from China, the cost of goods is the same as 2020. Container are back to 4,200, the same level I paid in 2019. So why is there an inflation of 12%???? USA DOLLARSWhen you print trillion of dollar and give it all away, or in Canada, you gave 4.3 billions to people that did not qualify… and possible you will not try to get it back…. someone has to repay that money, and that will be through TAXES. We have to much money looking for not enough goods. I went to buy an E-Transit (Ford electric van)…. the dealer wanted 10,000 above MSRP. He said “this is a high demand vehicle so we need more for it” THE FUTUREIn March 2023 you’ll see the year over year prices for house. We will see a decrease of at least 10%. There will be another interest rate before April 2023. With all the interest rate since Feb 2022, the bank will now be foreclosing on many homes…. We are already seeing 9,000 repo vehicles per day in the USA… Your money in the banks, even at 4% interest, you are losing due to inflation and with passive income tax, you are going backwards.So…. WHAT IS THE ANSWER If you live in the Micro World …. your only answer is REALTY, but that will not kick in till late 2023 for the bargains. All you can is weather the storm! If you live in the Macro World… inflation is a great place to be. They will do well, we all eat bananas. My suggestion… start checking realty, repo lots, get a HELOC on your house, get your finance house organized. In every recession, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES. IF YOU HAVE CASH, YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BARGAINS."},{"prompt":"Why do so many students in India study engineering?

Evaluating things through these two lenses is enlightening. Sleeping on the floor is weird, but kids have done it through history. You need to check to make sure that your kid is getting enough rest and not feeling sore. I’d also ask to see if there is any specific reason why they don’t like their bed. The mattress may be too soft, or it has a spring that pokes them, or whatever.

It is, in fact, a citizen’s responsibility to provide for their own self defense as well as defend those who aren’t so able.

And by dire, I mean at the point where nobody's making it out alive and I'm calling fires and air on my own position to kill as many of them as I can because we're all dead anyway level dire. I refuse to be captured, especially not by the enemy that we fight nowadays. ISIL doesn't believe in Geneva, and the Taliban are spotty about it. Some commanders will try to follow it, others do not care at all. Russian small arms and Medium/heavy machine guns have a set of very distinctive sounds to them, like the deep popping sound of an AK series or PKM or the chugging sound of a DshK (and I hate the sound of a Dishka above all). There are plenty of YouTube videos with comparisons between common NATO weapons like the M4, FAMAS, G36 and L86 and Warsaw Pact weapons like the AK-47/AKM/AK-74 and PKM so you can see what I mean. If I hear a bunch of AK-47 fire coming from nearby, I'm going to direct fires toward it unless I know for certain that they're Green Force (ANA, ANP and Iraqi forces use a lot of Soviet equipment). If it's unexpected, and I hear a lot of AK fire from where it shouldn't be, and nobody's said anything over the radio about it, I'm going to assume it's the enemy breaking through and I'm going to engage it.

However, I like to share to my Chinese friends out there my learning journey as a Chinese who failed his english exam throughout his teenage years but did have a breakthrough in university. “Save face” or shy We are been discouraged ask questions in classroom. “Don't ask stupid questions”, “See that guy who always ask question, he is wasting our time”. I get that alot when I was in class filled with Chinese students. I sense we don't want to stand out in front of crowd and hence we want to “save face”, we don't clarify our questions. I was also just one of the faces in the crowd, seldom did I question teachers about things I don't understand. Fortunately, I became more inquisitive when I entered university. I began to ask questions, many questions. It was during this period, my proficiency in english takes off. So I encourage all to shed that shyness and coat on a childlike mindset. Start questioning. Questioning is like a farmer planting his seed. The seed would eventually be ready for harvest, given the time and enough watering. P.S.

Are American and Israeli commentators correct that such assurances are dangerously naïve?","completion":"There were no official reports of Saudi Arabia and the UAE signing deals with Iran specifically to protect themselves from the fallout of a military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. It's important to note that my information might be outdated, and there may have been developments since then. However, I can provide you with some general context. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other countries in the region have expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program and its potential regional implications. Geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East are complex, and countries often engage in various diplomatic efforts to manage potential conflicts and maintain stability in the region. Such efforts could involve negotiations, agreements, and dialogues with neighboring countries, including Iran. American and Israeli commentators, as well as many other experts, have differing views on the efficacy and potential risks of such deals. Some might argue that engaging with Iran diplomatically can be a way to prevent military escalation and encourage Iran to comply with international agreements regarding its nuclear program. Others might see such deals as naive and potentially giving Iran undue influence or concessions without ensuring compliance with international regulations. Whether these assurances are dangerously naive or not depends on multiple factors including the details of the deals, the intentions of the involved parties, the broader regional context, and the evolving dynamics in international relations. It's important to stay updated with the latest news and analyses from reliable sources to understand the current state of affairs and the opinions of various experts."},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"You see a handful who are still injured.

I heard how we got there - the methods, the pain, the wishing it worked, how a few got 911-called and handcuffed, sectioned, by school, by their own parents. If you asked someone who got comfortable or plain didn’t care (their past), you hear about the physical fights with their father, running away, girlfriends back home, dead friends, how good an addiction felt in sick detail, and some other graphic traumatic events. Some don’t mention their past at all, everyone sees when they go quiet at their turn and watches them sleep away hours in their bed.

But, that person is lying on the cot, hands behind his head, all vital signs are within normal range, everything about him says he’s relaxed. There’s a good chance he’s a drug seeker. Usually it’s back pain, abdominal pain, severe headache, or some other symptom that a physical exam cannot confirm or disprove. Sometimes a patient will blatantly push for drugs, “You guys can give Fentanyl, right?” Others are more subtle, and like to lie on the cot and moan.

I don’t think that ultra-realistic video game graphics will be a great boon to video games. We’re already at the point where video game graphics look amazing enough. At this point, art direction is much, much more important than the raw graphical power of a game. I think the real benefit to a few more generations in video game graphics is going to be in movies and TV. It will become ever cheaper to create movies and TV using game engines or engines that are very similar to game engines. I predict that this will democratize movie-making and anyone with great writing skills will be able to organize a team to create an amazing movie on the cheap. As for video games, I’ll answer the question I wish you had asked: How will hardware innovations affect gameplay innovations in the future? Most of the history of video games has been a history of hardware innovations enabling gameplay innovations. For example, 3D hardware innovations in the late 90’s drove the shift to 3D games. It’s true that blockbusters like Doom and Quake drove people to buy powerful graphics cards that could handle 3D, but it’s also true that games like Doom and Quake were made just about as soon as hardware powerful enough to run them became cheap enough to be widely adopted. So what gameplay innovations await hardware innovations to enable them? I imagine someday we’ll have good, cheap, virtual reality and that may lead to gameplay innovations, but I have trouble imagining what they would be. One possibility is that procedurally-generated content could get more sophisticated. Currently, procedurally-generated content just feels all samey. I’ve never understood why it excited people, but people lost their minds at the prospect of procedurally-generated “No Man’s Sky.” I didn’t because I know procedurally-generated content all feels the same. I imagine with increased computational power and more sophisticated algorithms, perhaps combined with custom-content, it might get easier to generate lots of unique-seeming assets that might bring development costs down. This doesn’t sound too promising to me. But there’s one hardware innovation that I can see occurring in in the next ten years that may drastically affect gameplay: AI. The ability to meet, have conversations with, and develop relationships with AI characters is something I can see happening within the next ten years and it would revolutionize gaming. One interesting aspect of this is the gender balance in gaming. Up until now, gaming has overwhelmingly appealed to men, and this is largely because the kind of experiences that games can give people are the kind of experiences that men find enjoyable. It’s pretty easy to pretend a mouse cursor is a gun to give an experience that simulates combat. Women, however, are much more stimulated by relationships, and games that allow players to establish deep relationships with AI characters could reverse the gender imbalance in the video game market. Not that this reversal would be as drastic as the current imbalance is. Men would still find plenty of games to amuse them, but AI-based relationships would draw a lot more women into video games."},{"prompt":"Why is King Gyanendra regaining support in Nepal?","completion":"Its been told that a Royal Soothsayer predicted on the birth of Gyanendra Shah ,this child will ascend to Nepal’s throne thrice. Gyanendra shah being a second son of King Mahendra was not in direct lineage to deserve throne but somehow he managed to indeed ascend to throne twice already. In Novemeber 1950, during a political plot against Rana Regime, then King Tribhuwan, then King fled with his family to New Delhi leaving Gyanendra behind. Rana ruler Mohan Shamsher picked Gyanendra to make a shadow king on 7 November 1950.He remained king for almost 3 months till his grandfather returned. Later, after the Royal Massacre, Gyanendra became King as apparent heir of throne among the survivors on 4th June 2001. His second term as a king was ride of roller-coaster. Suspicion of his nature and allegation of his involvement in Royal Massacre was widespread. Meanwhile, political parties took advantage of this sentiment and removed him as King on people’s movement in 2008. Now, after almost 12 years a huge bunch of people are keenly looking for reestablishment of monarchy in the country after disappointment with the political parties who failed to keep promises. Sentiment of people is that It is better to be robbed by lone king rather hundreds of petty-kings, referring corrupt bureaucrats and politicians. In Last several years,Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a political party with monarchy and hindusim are leading group of supporters with protests, rallies and social media movement to establish kingship again.

What is go inside?","completion":"Hi It seems to me, it is usual ‘spiritual’ teachers do not give clear instructions or do not define clearly what they mean. It is probably due to blaming words in some way, due to judgement of the world/the physical. Spirituality for me, seems to try to deal with the same things a psychology, just they have different language and both of them have unclear, conflicting or inconsistent definitions. Making sure we are talking about the same thing, seems to me to be a basic necessity of communication using language. For me, I try to follow the Buddha’s teaching which is very different from Buddhism, with it’s dogma and hierarchy, like any organised religion. For more info on that, you can see my book called Buddha vs Buddhism, or the Broken Dharma on academia dot net, if you like. The Buddha analysed experience into five aspects: form, sensation, idea, emotion and awareness. Gurus might judge form, sensation and idea as false, bad, illusion or some other way. Sometimes gurus might value those things and sometimes not. That is because they are forced to acknowledge they may be necessary in everyday life. When they say go (deep) inside, they will probably mean something like, a quiet still place, that they may claim is not conditioned. There may be no perception of form, sensations and ideas, which are grosser aspects of experience and just a subtle peaceful emotion and awareness. Theistic religions will probably identify this experience as the experience of God. The Buddha acknowledged all experience is conditioned and we should choose to develop experience, which is wholesome or right, that is, not harmful to oneself or others. He does not judge any of the five aspects as harmful, unreal or untrue in some way. It is only clinging to one or more as the ‘ultimate truth’, ‘reality’ and negating the others, that he claimed is the cause of suffering, not the aspects themselves. In other words, he did not blame tools. He encouraged us to use the tools of the five aspects of experience, to develop wholesome experience, which is also conditioned, but brings happiness to ourselves and or others, rather than unwholesome experience that brings the opposite. Clinging to subtler aspects of experience, such as subtle emotion and awareness and judging and dismissing the other grosser aspects, is suffering, as it causes stress in our everyday, since we have to use those aspects in everyday life. Rather than judging aspects of experience as inside or outside, the Buddha would encourage us to know all aspects of experience, just as they are, conditioned and either bringing suffering to ourselves and or others, or not. Seeing experience is conditioned and what the conditions are, is part of meditation and wisdom development, when we see the conditions for suffering experience, we can stop putting out energy there and invest it in wholesome/suffering free experience, which is also conditioned… Best wishes"},{"prompt":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"No. I'd say life is harder. In many ways society is built for average intelligence, or even lower, and people who don't ask questions and like to just be given one job and run with it. Life is /tough/ when you're smart. Not just society and work and constant need for more stimulation and change, but constantly being irritated by others. Nobody wants to be constantly triggered by the feeling that so many around you act dumb. Or by being able to spot ignorances in people's speak at every turn. It takes so much mental practice to actually ignore all those irks and treat people well. Also, when you know stuff other's don't, and you can't always explain how. It's mentally lonely. However, as others have said, we're often shit at actually getting down and doing stuff. Being bored easily or thinking things are below us. Leaves us without true skills, groundedness in hobbies, communities and jobs, and more. It takes commitment just as with any other person to actually dedicate yourself to a skill, or a conversation with someone. I recommend travelling. Getting yourself so much new information for your mind and senses all at once kicks the brain back into gear and puts the general society irritations at bay. Suddenly it feels good for your brain to work quick — pick up languages quickly, form friends quickly (usually without judgement because they genuinely have so much to teach you about their culture), learn new skills, explore new environments."},{"prompt":"Where has Indian media gone wrong?","completion":"Yes, It is not performing in a manner that is appropriate to the needs of Indian society. There could be multiple reasons but mentioning one. In many parts of India, the news media is not used by the majority of people. Moreover, the majority of people do not subscribe a news paper. This has one important implication. Media does not have to take into account their concerns. Hence media highlights the issues of Indian elites and middle-class. It can neglect the issues of the poor and lower middle-class. This is much more so in the English-language media. It is used by elites and middle-class or its revenue comes from advertisements aimed at the same social groups."},{"prompt":"Would spending 100 dollars a day or week on lottery tickets increase your odds at hitting the jackpot? Or are the odds so low that someone buying 1 ticket has the same chance essentially?","completion":"The meaningful number on buying lottery tickets isn’t the jackpot. It’s the mathematical expectation of what the average person will get for each dollar they spend on lottery tickets. That’s the sum of all possible prizes multiplied by the probability of winning each prize. For every lottery out there, the expectation is negative. For every dollar you spend, you (everyone on average, including the jackpot winners) might get back 0.25 to 0.50. You’ll never get your full dollar back. If you spend hundreds of dollars a day on lottery tickets, you’ll just lose a lot more money faster - 100 or more a day instead of 0.50 or 0.75. Is your chance of winning the jackpot higher than someone who only buys one ticket? Yes. My game development team once won a Sega Genesis from Burger King when they gave us a couple hundred tickets as an apology for getting our order wrong every day for a month during crunch time.

How long could they sustain the war?","completion":"A war is won when the war-objective is achieved. So what can be the war-objective of Sine-India combine? If Sino-India war machineries were to join hands to attack US mainland, destroy its war assets and occupy the conquered territories. It cannot be done simply because neither of the two countries has true power projection capabilities. Several attempts to conquer Russia failed abysmally in 18th & 19th centuries when the invading armies had to face General January and General February. Similarly USA enjoys the admirable services of Admiral Pacific. In case China and India come together to repel US aggression on either of the countries, they don’t really need to join forces to face such an aggression. Each of them on its own is well capable of defending against any US invasion. Reference may be made to my answer on Quora on a similar question – [LINKED_TEXT: Is-it-possible-for-the-United-States-to-completely-defeat-Indias-military-within-3-6-weeks-Description-provided-below/answer/Niraj-Verma] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-for-the-United-States-to-completely-defeat-complete-annihilation-of-every-standing-military-unit-Indias-military-within-3-6-weeks-with-no-WMDs-on-either-side-and-no-allies/answer/Niraj-Bishun]. In short in both the cases the aggressor would lose. But there is a third possibility. Suppose China and India come to an understanding that each will support the other in carving and maintaining its own regional sphere of influence. In such a scenario since the theater of action will be closer home the combined Sino-India war machineries may very well force USA to concede their superiority in their respective regional sphere of influence. USA can neither indulge in coercive missile diplomacy nor threaten use of its overseas bases in the area for fear of triggering WW-III.

Here are some essential elements to consider: 1. Knowledge and research: in-depth knowledge about the sport, teams, players, and recent trends is crucial. Stay up-to-date with news, statistics, and expert analysis to make informed betting decisions. 2. Bankroll management: managing your bankroll effectively is vital. Set a budget and avoid chasing losses. Place bets within your means and allocate stakes wisely to mitigate risks. 3. Understanding odds: learn how to interpret odds and their implied probabilities. This knowledge helps identify value bets and assess the likelihood of an outcome accurately. 4. Strategy and discipline: develop a consistent betting strategy based on careful analysis rather than relying on instincts or emotions. Maintain discipline by sticking to the strategy and avoiding impulsive decisions. 5. Shop for the best odds: compare odds across different bookmakers to maximize your potential returns. Utilize odds comparison websites to find the best value for your bets. 6. Specialize and focus: rather than betting on multiple sports or markets, specialize in one or two areas. Focusing on specific niches allows you to become more knowledgeable and gain an edge. 7. Record keeping and analysis: maintain a record of your bets, including wins, losses, and the reasoning behind your decisions. Regularly review and analyze your performance to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. 8. Embrace patience: successful sports betting requires patience and a long-term perspective. Avoid chasing short-term gains and focus on consistent profitability over time. Of course, it is important to use only reliable sources like [LINKED_TEXT: ทางเข้าUFABET] [URL: https://www.ufabetwins.info/ufabet-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9A/].

The Wei army under Tsao Tsao was camped on the north side of a large river. It was invading the south, and planned to conquer the Wu faction. If Wu fell, the other faction, Shu, would also fall, as Wei would be far too powerful. Wei had 250,000 troops, and the alliance could only muster 50,000. They had caught the Wei army at a river crossing, so normal doctrine dictates you defend. But the disparity in forces meant that would only be a slower defeat. So Shu and Wu devised a plan. They sent over a \\"traitor\\" who warned the Wei of saboteurs attempting to destroy the Wei ships. He also promised defectors would steal Wu ships and sail to the other side of the river. Tsao Tsao chained his ships together to prevent sabotage, and awaited the defectors. A southeastern wind then blew across the battlefield, perfect for what Wu and Shu were really up to. They sent ships manned by skeleton crews out into the river. The ships approached Tsao Tsao's fleet. Then the crews lit the ships on fire! Fire ships slammed into the massed Wei fleet, and lit it ablaze, causing chaos and panic! The allied forces then crossed with their real fleet and attacked Wei, and the fire spread to the Wei shore camp. Before long, Tsao Tsao was forced to withdraw without much of his supplies. The trip back to Wei was full of perils, and he lost many men, though exact numbers are debated.

The Germans developed radar independently in the 1930s and, if anything, were initially technologically more advanced than the British. Certainly by late 1938, the Germans were entering production with naval gun-laying and search radars (Seetakt). Where the Germans lagged behind was in developing the supporting fighter control network that the British had implemented before the Battle of Britain and that was a major element in the British victory. This is often misunderstood and radar is given rather more credit than it deserves in isolation. German Giant Wurzburg radar The Germans did develop a reasonably effective detection and control system in the Kammhuber Line using Freya radar sets that controlled search-lights and night-fighters in a box about 30km by 20km. German radars of WW2 (from the Lone Sentry blog) The other area where the Germans fell behind was in developing centimetric radar. The British centimetric radar, H2S used the newly invented cavity magnetron to operate at 10 cm (3 GHz). Once H2S was salvaged from crashed aircraft, the Germans set about developing their own centimetric radar. The slow development of German radar was not due to technical ability but, as so often with the Nazi regime, to a lack of sensible prioritisation."},{"prompt":"Who is the best email campaign management vendor out there?","completion":"Generally speaking though, as a thallu. com user , you have access to a variety of flexible designs.

There were foederati (mercenaries) in the Roman army. There is evidence of Germanic soldiers in Britain long before 449. There was probably a Latin speaking minority still living in the Lowland zone of Sub-Roman Britain when the Anglo-Saxons arrived. The question of whether this influenced the growth of Latinisms in English is not clear. But the assumption is probably not, because many seem to have fled to Western Britain, which had been the least Romanised part of the island.

Why?","completion":"Explanation of Electron Affinity and Differences Between Magnesium, Helium, and Calcium Electron affinity refers to the energy change that occurs when an atom gains an electron. It is a measure of the attraction between the atom and the added electron. Atoms with high electron affinity tend to attract electrons strongly, while those with low electron affinity tend to repel electrons. Magnesium and Helium: Magnesium and helium have a complete outermost shell, making them highly stable and therefore, have no tendency to gain or lose electrons. Since they have no unpaired electrons, they cannot easily accommodate an additional electron, resulting in zero electron affinity. Calcium: Calcium, on the other hand, has an incomplete outermost shell, making it highly reactive. It requires two electrons to complete its outermost shell and attain a stable configuration. Thus, calcium can easily accept an additional electron and form an anion, resulting in a negative electron affinity."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"The efficiency of power delivered to a load is always less than 50% in practical cases.

Such as “AR-15s are assault rifles”. They are not! To say they are is either to be ignorant, or a liar. Those Are your Only two options. “Ban assault weapons!”You say. “Assault weapons” is a political pejorative invented by an anti-gun radical to gaslight the ignorant public into supporting gun control. It’s a deliberate lie. That’s not being emotional, That’s cold, hard, fact! “We want “common sense” gun laws.” Oh really? And just what Are these “common sense” gun laws you speak of? They are never defined! We gun owners know it’s a euphemism for a total ban on civilian ownership of firearms because that is the stated goal of the people who are in charge of the gun control agenda. By being so good sounding and vague, the “useful idiots” (Saul Alinsky’s term, not mine) of the gun control movement keep chanting it over and over without even knowing what they are advocating for. Another oft repeated lie is “We don’t want to ban all guns, only dangerous assault rifles/weapons”. As I have already pointed out, the guns you are calling “assault rifles” are not. And “assault weapons” is a political pejorative, and Not a class or category of firearms. And again, yes you Do want to ban all firearms in the hands of citizens since that is the stated goal of the movement, and by using lies and misleading terms like “assault rifle “ and “assault weapons “ you try to place all firearms into those imaginary categories so they can be banned.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"The debate over whether private schools are better than public schools has been a topic of discussion for many years. While it is difficult to provide a clear-cut answer to this question, there are several factors that can be considered when comparing private and public schools. Firstly, private schools often have smaller class sizes, which means that students can receive more individualized attention from teachers. This can result in better academic performance and a more personalized learning experience for students. Additionally, private schools often have more resources available, such as better technology, facilities, and extracurricular activities which in return should be considered the [LINKED_TEXT: best schools in Mohali] [URL: https://www.bfis.in/]. On the other hand, public schools are often more diverse and inclusive, as they are open to all students regardless of their background or socio-economic status. Public schools also have more regulations and oversight, which ensures that they meet certain standards of education and safety. It is important to note that the quality of education can vary widely between private and public schools and that both types of schools can have excellent or poor educational outcomes depending on a variety of factors. Furthermore, the cost of attending a private school can be prohibitively expensive for many families, which means that they are often only accessible to a select group of students. Ultimately, whether private schools are better than public schools depends on a variety of individual factors, such as the quality of the specific school, the needs of the student, and the financial resources available to the family. Both types of schools have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to each family to make an informed decision based on their unique circumstances."},{"prompt":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","completion":"At the end of the day, regardless of doctrine, training, what if, what should have beens, if you’re in combat its kill or be killed.

Students generally stay in the same classroom for one full year, and the teachers are the ones who change classrooms. Students take only two written exams per semester. Korean students may not understand the importance of quizzes in American schools, so it might be helpful to explain this to them. Koreans take education - particularly higher education - very seriously. Academics in Korea are very competitive; students treat their teachers with respect and are extremely serious about their studies. Korea has a number of prestigious universities, and most of these are located in Seoul. South Korea's education system is quite demanding.

In a wave, there is no specific place where the energy resides - it is not at the peak or trough or exactly anywhere. Maths hates this, but Quantum Mechanics found an excellent mathematical way to deal with it: it decides that the energy is present in a particle (of zero size - you can do that in Maths) but only probable location, so the probability of finding it is smeared across the wave. This picture is enhanced by the fact that two key waves - light waves and ‘electron waves’, cannot break: they are the smallest of their kind of thing and so, when they are absorbed, they transfer all their energy in one moment at one place. This is what the collapse of the wave-function models: the probabilities vanish across zero time and our zero size particle materialises for zero time to be absorbed. Physically, a problem: mathematically, brilliantly predictive. In physics the wave is absorbed, as a sound wave is absorbed by your ear-drum, by the energy being transferred to another item but with the big issue that it does so all at once. Both pictures require a non-local collapse but this is somehow more acceptable in the mathematical version since it is clearly a non-real model (although Einstein was troubled by this at the 1929 Solvey conference). It is at the core of fundamental physics’ problems that the ‘particle’ is seen as in some way real, although the double-slit experiment shows without question that light and ‘electrons’ cannot be particles but poses no problem for waves. Now we have all accepted non-local effects, we should be able to move on but we are held back by Max Planck’s dictum - ironic from the inventor of the quantum particle 120 years ago - that “Physics moves forward one funeral at a time”."},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"A passion which I have made into my profession.The chance that a story which I write today could be read by hundreds of thousands of people by the night.A family which has allowed me to carve my own path instead of forcing their wills upon me.The sense of purpose when I know that thousands of followers believe in me and my stories, and are on this amazing journey along with me.The excitement of now seeing my words being made into web-series.

GATE scores also help in the recruitment of PSU. It is known as one of the toughest exams which need the right preparation. Every year many graduates apply for this exam but few of them get a chance. Our single mistake will affect our result. So, here are some common mistakes which should be avoided by an aspirant. Starting without proper planning and late preparation Starting late preparation is one of the most common things which an aspirant does while preparing. Aspirants think that they will cover the syllabus easily and they skip days for preparations. But GATE exam contains a vast syllabus which cannot be covered in the very short term. Along with things they also don’t make any plans that how they will cover the syllabus. Planning is a very important part in GATE preparation because without planning you can’t manage time for studying and revision. Ignoring Topics and no revision Another big mistake which is made by the GATE spirant that many of them ignore the topic of the subjects given in the syllabus because they think they can cover it easily. Most of the aspirants focus only on studying but this is wrong practice while preparing for any exam. You need to make a short note of everything you are studying which will help you with the quick revision. Along with this you also need to do written practices which will help you to analyze your performance. Not Solving previous year question papers Many of aspirants focus only on the study and they ignore solving the previous year question paper. Previous year question papers help the aspirant to understand the pattern of the examination. It is also a good practice for revision which helps to analyze performance. Not attending college lectures Many of the aspirants think that only coaching will help for the preparation of the GATE examination and they start skipping the college lectures for their coaching. However only focusing on the college lecture will also not help you to score good marks. But for better preparation, you need to manage time for both college lectures and coaching."},{"prompt":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","completion":"Used to work at Starbucks, a few years back.

There’s blood all over the walls and the sink, and a syringe on the floor. Not a couple of dainty spritzes, it looked like a murder scene. Previous guy was shooting up and probably hit an artery or something, then he projectile vomited bloody vomit all over the floor by the toilet.

On this analysis, some aspects of human nature are pretty stable and will only change on an evolutionary time scale (sensory processes, cognitive control, memory) while some social and cultural traits are unique to particular places and times in our history (racism, humor, and even some mental disorders). I'd say the social sciences are all on this continuum somewhere between physics and journalism. It's important to realize though, that, to form a complete picture of humanity, we need people working across the whole spectrum. You wouldn't harangue a journalist for not studying the eternal facts of the universe - he has politicians to bust!

How?","completion":"The value of each technique is very different. Structural evaluation requires more than one method to probe it, if you wish to determine the structure accurately. You can only decide which is best by being clear what information you need to clinch some key factors, and ultimately, it’s up to you to decide, based on lots of stuff you may already know, about the substance, where it came from, whether it’s pure or very contaminated. If pure, and crystaline, then x-ray spec is a clear winner, especially if you have crystals of the substance as standards for comparrison. If there is a range of environments that the NMR active atoms sit in, and knowing these will give you a big aid in identifying the substance, then NMR is the better method. Swings and roundabouts abound in the area of structural evaluations. If the substance is crystalline, pure and can be crushed to a poweder (where grains of powder are large compared to the molecules you are studying, x-ray is really valuable. If there is a range of chain-lengths (e.g. polymers with poor chain-length control during manufacture, NMR is very valuable. Have you considered probing in TEM using microtomes, with electron diffraction, Mass-Spec with NMR, Or, HPLC with Mass-Spec and standards to evaluate against? These methods can be super powerful. In principle though; To study a substance in NMR, it needs to contain NMR active atomic nuclei. If a solid is to be probed, you will need to use a Magic Angle Spinning NMR (MASNMR) device. This renders the solid to a state where it acts like a liquid as far as NMR is concerned (see theory for explanation of this). If in a solution, then NMR alone is better. Either way you will be able to glean information regarding environments for Hydrogen nuclei and any others that are active. Activity is determined from the nubers of neutrons and protons in a nucleus. The rule of thumb is based upon: Number of n(0) [= neutrons, with no charge] and Number of p(+) [= proton with +ve charge] in the nucleus: If n and p are both even numbers, e.g. C12 (where there are 6n and 6p) then the nucleus is NMR inactive. If No. of n(0) is odd and No. of p(+) is also odd then the nucleus is active. The spin quantum number determines activity. The below are active nuclei… Some analyses in NMR require you to have C13 included artificially , to probe the C-environment. Hydrogen is good as it is, as H [= 1 x p(+)] is active. NMR will provide the coordination number of the active nuclei, a great leg-up to structural probing in some cases Odd/Odd. Nuclei that contain an odd number of protons AND an odd number of neutrons have I that are positive integers. Examples include 2H (I=1), 14N (I=1) and 10B (I=3).Odd/Even & Even/Odd. All other nuclei (odd/even and even/odd) have spins that are half integral. Examples include 1H (I=1/2), 13C (I=1/2) 11B (I=3/2), 17O (I=5/2), 19F (I=1/2) and 31P (I=1/2) -X-ray Spec will reveal structural information on the spacing of crystal spacing of unit-cells. Thus, having information on the crystal in a standard will aid massively in checking structural info held in your spectra.HOPE this Helps!

What do you think about this?","completion":"Can’t believe I am about to agree with AOC but she is 100% right there. I mean we all know what happens. Powerful men, particularly in Hollywood, seem to get away with horrid sexual misconduct. They have the power and resources to silence whistleblowers. Women who fear for their careers or public image remain silent about abuse and men get away with it. Honestly, I think arguing against trans rights on the grounds of bathrooms is rather ridiculous. I mean seriously- what’s gonna happen? What goes on in a women’s bathroom? You think it's a naked pillow fight or is it, women, in private stalls using the restroom. I just don’t see any danger. I guess a trans person could lie in wait and rape a lone woman who enters the bathroom but a normal non-trans man could do that as well. I think there is a lot to be discussed in regards to trans issues. I do not think we have ruled it out as a disorder of some sort given the high depression and suicide rate among trans people. The gay community and black community suffered oppression for decades and their suicide rate never even touched that of the trans community. I think there is a bigger discussion around trans athletes in sports as well.

Well some points that I could come up with. Contrary to the question being asked, Kannadigas are well known amongst South Indians! It is their Kannadiga identity which is not well known. The guy in the Corner Office calling the shots in your company, might very well be a Kannadiga...however it is rarely made apparent. So if I were to ask do you know the MD of your company, your answer will most definitely be Yes! and when I ask do you know if he is a Kannadiga....I can safely say the answer would be a No. Such is the nature of Kannadigas. Over the generations we have developed the art of blending in and without any substantial effort...no army fatigues, no camouflage required. By virtue of the amazing culture modesty and respect for people is ingrained in most Kannadigas from an early age. Being loud is mostly considered rude! Hence you do not often hear a Kannadiga trying to compensate the lack of Radio coverage in a lift by exerting his voice to reach the other end of the phone! The logic applies to most public places, so in all likeliness a Kannadiga will walk past without you ever noticing....putting to shame even the likes of Jason Bourne. Many more reasons, however will restrict myself here...much like a Good Kannadiga :)"},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"Yes, I think a recession is likely the second half of 2023 through 2024.

People have been breeding large dogs for centuries, and there are many breeds that are considered large. However, compared to some of the largest wild cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, these dogs are not considered to be “big” in the same way. This begs the question, why are there no big dogs? To answer this, it is important to look at the evolutionary history of both cats and dogs. Cats and dogs both evolved from ancient carnivorous mammals. Cats evolved from the Felidae family, while dogs evolved from the Canidae family. Though they share similarities, cats and dogs have distinct differences in their evolutionary history and development. Cats are considered to be apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This led to the development of cats being solitary hunters and having a natural instinct to protect themselves from danger. Cats also evolved to have longer bodies, larger heads, and powerful claws for hunting prey. Their agility, strength, and stealth are unmatched in the animal kingdom. This allowed cats to evolve into larger species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, to better hunt their prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a pack-based hunter and scavenger lifestyle. Dogs’ survival depended on their ability to work together in a group and hunt or scavenge whatever food they could find. This led to the development of dogs having shorter bodies, smaller heads, and weaker claws for scavenging. Dogs are not considered to be apex predators, and therefore have not evolved into larger species like cats have. In addition, the domestication of dogs has also played a role in the lack of large dogs. Cats were domesticated much later than dogs, and their domestication has not altered their natural predatory instincts as much as it has with dogs. Dogs, on the other hand, have been domesticated for thousands of years and have developed a close relationship with humans. This has led to the selective breeding of dogs to be smaller and less aggressive, and has eliminated any natural instinct to survive without human help. The combination of evolutionary history and domestication has led to the lack of large breeds of dogs. Cats were able to evolve into larger species due to their natural predatory instincts, while dogs were bred to be smaller and less aggressive due to their domestication. Therefore, when it comes to large or “big” dogs, there are simply none that exist today. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

Bangladesh on the other hand is actually free from spending huge amounts of money on its army its surrounded by Nepal, Bhutan and India countries with which Bangladesh has no hostilities with.

During one period Portugal and Spain joined to one kingdom and came up with this division. As you can see, the Portuguese concentrated only on coastal regions and harbors, for trade. To my knowledge in later periods the Portuguese started to colonize more inland. When Portugal and Spain joined this ment for the Netherlands a legitimate reason for war also with Portugal (Spain occupied the Netherlands for 80 years until 1648, primarily the South (Belgium) and the East. They inherited the Netherlands due to the royal marriages back then) A lot of the Portuguese settlements were taken by the Dutch. The Portuguese-Dutch war you could call the first global war. The Dutch also were in it for trade and primarily concentrated on the coasts and harbors. One remark: Nagasaki was never a real colony, the Portuguese did trade there for 120 years, but later on it were the Dutch who could settle in a tiny island over there, for trade. Reason: Portugal brought missionaries to spread out through the entire country, Nippon would have none of it. The Dutch almost never brought religion with their trade and that’s why they could stay for 260 years. Tip: watch the movie ‘Silence’ on the subject of the Portuguese missionaries in Japan. How much is accurately true about it I can’t say, but it seems very convincing."},{"prompt":"Should recordkeeping be required on all ammunition sales in the USA?","completion":"No. Ammunition is a necessary component of a firearm, and under Heller, subject to the same protections. It’s also virtually harmless unless placed into a firearm; you can get some minor shrapnel wounds dumping a box of rifle rounds into a fire, but that’s your own damn fault, and you’d get the same by doing the same with a can of hairspray. So, should we require a DROS on all spray cans? No? Why? Oh, because that’s something you use on a daily basis and don’t want the hassle of the extra paperwork. Funny how that works. Records-keeping of ammunition sales is busy work for retailers and a hassle for lawful gun owners. People who “smuggle” ammunition into California (where such a DROS is required for ammunition) aren’t affected by it. The records have no practical use, because there’s no requirement to account for disposal of the ammunition, and there’s no records-keeping requirement for ammunition components (handloading/reloading supplies). So I can make my own ammunition and don’t have to tell a soul, and I also don’t have to tell a soul when I shoot a cartridge, whether I made it or bought it. So if I don’t have to tell anyone I shot it, how would anyone prove that instead of shooting it, I actually gave that cartridge - and 49 of its buddies in the same box - to my cousin Jose who just got out of Chino and needed a favor? People who use firearms for lawful purposes buy a lot of ammunition. Competition shooters can go through a thousand rounds in an afternoon of practice at the steels range. Even casual “plinkers” who slow-fire at paper targets for fun and practice can put 150 rounds downrange in an hour. You want lawful firearms owners to be doing this, with as little restriction as possible, because this is how we stay competent and proficient with the firearm, and proficient means safe; not only are we less likely to accidentally put a bullet through a window, we’re less likely to put a bullet over the shoulder of a mugger and into a bystander behind him. You want an accounting of every one of those thousands of rounds fired daily at shooting ranges? The RSOs and the shooters will all tell you to go fornicate with yourself instead of trying to fornicate them over. It’s a requirement very nakedly intended to make sure no rounds get fired at all, because nobody would want to fill out the paperwork to account for it. You wouldn’t abide by a requirement to account for your fuel purchases and use by the quart, and operating a car on public roads isn’t even a recognized right. Don’t expect us to sit and smile when you propose that dealers and gun owners account for every bullet fired."},{"prompt":"w can I buy IKEA or IKEAlike furniture in India?","completion":"I love IKEA’s design.

As recent as 50 years ago, much of what we call the South Bay today was farmland. There was no sprawling collection of freeways, no patches of suburban communities, no endless rows of expressways and strip malls. Lawrence Expressway may very well have been a dirt road. The earliest companies, Fairchild Semiconductor and HP, paved (quite literally and figuratively) the way for future developments throughout the 50s and 60s in the semiconductor and hardware industry all throughout the South Bay. What used to be food canning factories and farms now became semiconductor factories and corporate headquarters for companies such as Intel and AMD. Throughout this period, major communities either incorporated themselves (Cupertino, Campbell) or were annexed by the growing Frankenstein we call San Jose (Willow Glen, Cambrian Park). The advent of the computer and its application in the enterprise world began to change Silicon Valley in the 70s and 80s. Companies like Oracle and IBM (they already existed, but grew prominent during this time) began to dot the South Bay and Peninsula. At this point, much of the South Bay had been fully developed, and major business corridors like Stevens Creek and El Camino began to form. Shortly afterward, the arrival of the PC in the personal home brought an array of even newer companies. Apple was one of the major personal computer developers in the Valley. Atari was all the video game craze throughout the 80s. The Valley could have just been another sleepy, sprawly nerd haven. But then, something changed: The internet. VC money. Crazy market valuations. IPOs. “Bro I got a startup idea.” The 90s and early 2000s were a mad time. The internet was all the new trend. Internet startups were growing like weeds, going public at crazy market valuations, then suddenly taking a dive like a roller coaster. For the first time, tech was seen as a “cool industry”: It seemed as if anyone or anything could start a “tech” business, fund it using the large reservoirs of VC money, then IPO and become rich. After the dust settled and some of the posers packed their bags, what remained is what still what’s dominant today: the FAANGs. See, I believe the creation of the internet is what gave Silicon Valley the perception of what people see today: Facebook, Google, sexy startups. Before, the technology industry was largely dominated by hardware. But now, we are living in a world of software, and that software is eating the world. In fact, I can even see that around this time, the South Bay began to have more developments that one could perceive as “boujee.” Santana Row, a major luxury mixed-use shopping complex, was completed in the early 2000s. The Silver Creek Country Club, a fancy master-planned community in San Jose, was also built around the late 90s. Today, Silicon Valley is still changing. Unicorn startups have begun to take the front seat (albeit this is not necessarily a good thing). Artificial intelligence is now on the horizon. And as the technology continues to progress, more and more houses, shopping districts, and business centers are being built. If you ask me this question in a few years, maybe I can answer some of what has changed."},{"prompt":"What's it like being a Slider, a person whose energy effects electronic equipment by making it shut down, malfunction or go haywire?","completion":"I can't wear a quartz watch with a battery, within a few hours it dies never to return again, even with a new battery.

However, cats don't typically \\"abandon\\" their owners without cause. Here are some reasons why a cat may seem to distance themselves from their owner: 1. Change in routine: Cats are creatures of habit and can become stressed or anxious when their routine is disrupted. If there has been a change in the owner's schedule or living situation (such as moving to a new home), the cat may act out by hiding or avoiding the owner. 2. Medical issues: Cats are skilled at hiding signs of illness or pain, but changes in behavior can be an indication that something is wrong. If a cat suddenly becomes distant or uninterested in their usual activities, it may be due to an underlying medical issue. 3. Lack of socialization: Cats that were not socialized properly as kittens may have difficulty forming close bonds with their owners. Kittens that were separated from their mother and littermates too early may not have learned important socialization skills, which can affect their ability to form attachments later in life. 4. Trauma or abuse: Cats that have experienced trauma or abuse may have difficulty trusting humans, including their owner. It can take time and patience to earn the trust of a cat that has been mistreated. 5. Personality differences: Just like people, cats have their own unique personalities and preferences. Some cats may be more independent and prefer to be left alone, while others are more social and enjoy interacting with their owner. It's important to note that cats do not have the same level of attachment to their owners as dogs do. While cats can form strong bonds with their owners, they are not as reliant on human companionship as dogs are. This means that cats may not display the same levels of loyalty or affection as dogs, but this doesn't mean they are \\"abandoning\\" their owner. In conclusion, cats may appear to distance themselves from their owners for a variety of reasons, including changes in routine, medical issues, lack of socialization, trauma or abuse, and personality differences. It's important for cat owners to be patient and understanding with their feline companions, and to provide them with a safe and comfortable environment that meets their needs. With time and patience, cats can form strong bonds with their owners and become loving and loyal companions.

It’s one long road with very little going on. My wife (of the ex variety) commented on my speed and that she thought I should slow down as I had already picked up a speeding ticket outside Alice Springs. I had the cruise control set. It’s no problem I said, we are miles from anywhere, there are no police out here, it’s at least 6 hours drive from Alice. Well you can guess what happened next! I got pulled over, in the Northern Territories of Australia I think the speed limit was 110 kph (about 70mph). The conversation with the Police Officer followed it’s usual pattern: “How fast were you driving sir?; I’m not sure officer (I lied) We clocked you at 160 kph sir” At which point I glanced at the dash to see clearly 160 kph (100 mph) set on the cruise control “Really sir, I didn’t know I was going that fast. (that was a lie too) It’s a little too fast for these roads sir, there could be wild animals, etc. We get several fatalities per year.

He opens it and a genie appears. The genie says, “Because you have freed me from the lamp, I will grant you one wish.” The guy thinks about it and says, “You know, I’ve always wanted to visit Europe but I’m afraid of flying. Can you build a bridge across the Atlantic Ocean so I can drive there?” The genie says, “That’s ridiculous. Do you realize what sort of engineering feat you’re talking about? And think what it will do to shipping routes and fish migration. Come up with something more realistic.” The guy thinks some more and says, “OK, how about this? All my life, I’ve never understood women. I’d like to be able to understand women, to anticipate their moods, to understand what they mean when they say something or don’t say anything.

US universities also tend to have broader general-education requirements, so you will end up with fewer focused classes in your major. There are, of course, exceptions.

First things first, she was three months old when he purchased her. She’d been living in the cage at the pet store that entire time which became the source, we think, of why we were never able to house train or crate train her, she would go to the bathroom in her crate no matter what we tried, I’d even take my short lunch time during the week to rush home to take her own to try to prevent accidents. Didn’t matter. One time we let her out of her crate when returning home from work and instead of going for the door she immediately crossed the room, jumped on the sofa, and relieved herself. I tried to teach her to walk on a leash, that didn’t work either, probably for obvious reasons. She was a very sweet, affectionate dog but in the end we just couldn’t handle her. We have a 20 Acre property and she had free range in the yard within reason (invisible fence). Well, the fence didn’t always stop her, just kept going. The whole world was a chew toy. Indestructible toys are totally destructible. She ate many things she wasn’t supposed to, including but not limited to: The porch floor, all of the wiring off of our generator, tubing off of the pressure washer, a hammer, her brand new brush (my bad, shouldn’t have left it on top of the cage), the coffee table legs, a collar, a harness, the wiring from our satellite dish, the lawn, and the offense that had us finding her a new home (aside from all of the going to the bathroom in the house despite best efforts) SHE ATE THE WIRING FROM THE MOTORCYCLE.

Most of us believe the gun laws in the US are stupid, and we have it about right in the UK - we can own shotguns or rifles, but need a licence and a way of securing them safely. Abortion should be the choice of the woman, within reasonable limits. For me, the limit should be *just* before the point where the fetus would have a chance of survival if born prematurely at that time. Shamefully, the right to gay marriage was only introduced fairly recently, it most certainly shouldn’t be ended. I’m not gay, but have known a number of people (of both sexes) who are, and counted a number of them among my friends. Why would you want to discriminate against them?

God already knows your needs (better than you), before heaven & earth were created. Praying on it is own, is an act of worship (remember, not my opinion), you don't pray to get your wishes granted, you pray because God wants you to pray (again, not my opinion). You pray because it is (when done right) a true sincere submitting to him, a true admitting that the power is his, not yours, that knowledge is his, not yours, that no matter how great you are, how powerful you get, how wise, or rich, you still admit that you need him, admit it is all from him, and you are always poor to him. No matter how powerful you get, or how independent you are from others, your heart is only attached to him. This is why people who experience their prays answered, it usually happens at the moments in their lives when they gave up hope on everyone & everything. Their hopes at that moment were only in God, they were in a true submitting state to him, a prayer done right. So, either you wait until you are broken so bad that you are forced to submit, or just from the get-go, submit willingly and go on with your life. You are not submitting if you don’t believe in him as wants, you are not submitting if you don’t accept his rules, you are not submitting if you are not content with fate (things that are out of your control, BE AWARE, that does not mean to be negative, if you lose your sight due to an accident that is a fate, you accept it, that does not mean you shouldn’t try to gain your sight again -again, not my opinion) Now to your questions: Why God Does Not Answer Your Prayer? (a gentle reminder, None of the following are my opinions) Remember, this is God you are asking, he answers as he sees fit, the way he sees fit, the time he sees fit. Sometimes your prayer might be answered before you lower your hands, and sometimes (like in one prayer of Abraham’s -peace be upon him-) the prayer could be answered thousands of years laterHow do you know that he didn’t answer you?When you pray to God he will either:Give you what you asked forGive you something else that he sees fitYour prayer will block an ill fate (or reduce it), you asked for a great job, but your prayer blocked a cancer. The prophet peace be upon him said: “Nothing repel fate other than prayer”Your prayer will be kept for Judgment Day, you won’t get what you asked for, instead, your prayer will benefit you on Judgment Day.Or your prayer won’t be heard reasons for your prayers to be rejectedAssociating (in worship or attributes) anything with God, there is no point in praying to a false God, if you believe that God is 123, while God is xyz, then you are praying for something that does not exist…. sooo duhNot being sincere, praying with an unfocused heartSins (when you insist on them)Earning your living from illegal sources (illegal in God’s rules) like gambling, stealing, selling drugs or alcohol, prostitution etcPraying for something wrong or harmfulRushing the answer, saying “I prayed, and I was not answered”Not repeating and insisting (remember, it is a sign of submission and acceptance).God wants you to insist in your prayers, The prophet -Peace be upon him- said: “God Loves The Insisting (in asking) servant” Please Note Don’t be an imbecile!!Don’t go praying for success while you don’t leave your bed, expecting God to do your work is disrespectful, to say the least A man asked the prophet -Peace be upon him-: “shall I tie my camel or depend (that God will watch over it for me)?”, the prophet -Peace be upon him- replied: “Tie it and Depend” Don’t use prayer as a distraction from your laziness. If you pray for wealth, get up, and get working, it doesn’t rain gold and silver. I hope this answers your question, If you have any more questions (or just want to tell me how awesome I am), shoot away, I will be more than happy to answer them if I can.

It is a methodical process of understanding business needs, strategizing & creating written scripts or data that help reach defined business goals. Types of Content 1- Content for SEO: This is a type of content writing for getting websites to rank on search engines. SEO content writers should be well adept at factors influencing search engine rankings. They have to adhere to rules laid down by search engines for the content being posted. 2- Web Content Web content writing is specific to the demands or expectations of the website it is being written for. Every website has a market group they cater to & web content writers have to stay faithful to that. 3- Technical Writers: Technical writing has many types within itself. But to summarise, technical writing involves written documentation for technology, research papers, manuals, etc. These documents need precision writing and there is no room for error. Technical write-ups are one of the lengthy written content but the job is very well paying. 4- Blogs If you are reading this article, we are sure that you either are a blogger or intend to be one. A blog is a written journal. It can range from writing about products or services to a look into the blogger’s personal life. Blogging is a great first step to creating & expanding your online presence. 5- Emailers The email notifications you get when your favorite shoe is out for delivery. That is an example of emailers. Emailers are automated responses that are sent out based on a customer’s actions. Though the writing part seems less in emailers, it requires a lot of creativity and an attention-grabbing writing style. 6- Social Media Social media is the current trend. You must be living under a rock if you are not aware of the potential of social media. From individual social media influencers to social media handles of big corporations, this is one place for all. Content that is produced and written on social media reaches the maximum audience. This type of writing is short and crisp and that is what makes it tricky.

Also, why did you let them start at THAT age (e.g. 13) and not 1 year younger or 1 year older?","completion":"Q: If you let your children watch R-rated movies before they were 17, how old were they when that happened? In our household, the philosophy is that you pay attention to your kids and gauge by their reactions whether they are ready to see or do certain things, including watch movies and TV shows with age restrictions. By “ready” I mean both intellectually and emotionally. There is no specific age at which that point is reached. Some kids may not be able to handle everything in the Harry Potter movies at age 12, while others have no problem with Deadpool at age 9. An important aspect is that the same child may find certain R-rated movies not scary or disturbing at all, while being uneasy watching others. A key is also to watch this kind of thing with your children. To give an example, we just finished binge-watching Game of Thrones with our 12-year old."},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"I've stopped 3 felonies that I know of and in none of those instances did my firearm ever leave the holster. The last was most fun. A moron came to rob the gas station where I was a customer. I open carried everywhere when I lived in vegas. I saw the masked guy coming through the door drawing what looked like a high point pistol (gun enthusiast know what that is) in his waistband of his Dickies that were loose. He saw me turn towards him and I guess he saw my firearm because right as I was about to draw my weapon he yelled “fuck me” and tried bolting out the door. He Tripped over his own feet lost his gun but escaped. Cops come make report confiscate his dropped gun. Couple weeks later the station owner told me they got him. The gun he had was his uncle's. Cops knew that because his older brother had already stolen the gun once out of the uncle's safe so police had record of who owned it and that it was not the gun owner it was his sisters hood rats. Too bad attempted armed robbery and theft of a piece of shit Saturday night special only gets someone a year or two before parole That's why I open carry. The very presence of my firearm stops idiots when they see it. It is a myth that open carry just means crook shoots you first that's old school gangster and organized crime shit. There are easier ways to steal than to come in shooting right from start. If everyone nationwide had the constitutional carry we would see crime drop significantly. We would have to have armed guards at the few places where it is a legitimate safety concern to carry fyi school isn't one of them . We cannot afford to put enough guards at schools to be effective. I would however say that at school it should always be concealed carry not open for the same reason I don't like uniformed officers or metal detectors.

It’s there to fill pots with water and save you from having to lug them from sink to stove. Pot fillers are nice and convenient. If you cook a lot of pasta, mashed potatoes, whatever, they save you a little effort when doing those things. They only save you half the effort though. You might have a pot filler to put water in the pot, but you’re still the pot un-filler, because you have to lug it to the sink to drain out the water when your food is done cooking. If you’re re-doing your kitchen and you want to plumb in a pot filler, go for it. If you’ve got the money, someone will have the time. Is it important to have one? That’s for you to decide. I wouldn’t benefit from having one because I don’t boil much of anything in that fashion at home.

At that time sridevi was just 13 years old, she had appeared in a matured role as heroine to Kamal Haasan and as a step mother to Rajnikanth. At that time Rajnikanth was struggling to establish his career in the cine field. Rajnikanth and Sridevi's mother were good friends. He remained close to Sridevi and to her family for many decades till Sridevi’s demise. In around 25 films Rajnikanth and Sridevi worked together. Sridevi was having very good opinion on Rajnikanth, In an interview, when she was speaking about her experience with her co-stars on the sets of Moondru Mudichu she had shared some funny incidents that had happened during shooting. She had also praised Rajnikanth and had said, “ He is humble, very good at heart. He always wants to help others. He doesn't like it when someone is facing some difficulty. He wants everyone to be happy. He is a good man and very talented.” Sridevi also revealed that her salary for Moondru Mudichu was 5,000. Her co-stars Kamal got the payment of 30,000 and Rajnikanth Rs.2000. Kamal Haasan was already an established actor, but Sridevi, as a lead actress and Rajnikanth were new to film industry. Rajnikanth used to say to Sridevi's mother, about how he can become a big star like Kamal, he wanted to earn 30,000 like Kamal. Sridevi’s mother would say that , Rajni will defneatly become s he wishes to be. Rajnikanth was like a son to Sridevi’s mother. His bondage was very special with Sridevi and her family. Some years back Rajnikanth’s health condition got worsened and he took a long treatment at a Singapore hospital. At that time Sridevi did fasting for 7 days for the betterment of Rajnikanth’s health. This shows that their friendship was very deep and genuine. Both had acted in nearly 25 films in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Their first Hindi film was Bhagwan Dada in 1986.

Both the actors appeared together in many films like: 16 Vayadhinile ( first color film for Rajini and Sridevi) Gayathri, Priya ( first overseas shooting for both the stars), Dharmayutham, Jonny (Rajni's first dual role film) Pokkiri Raja, Adutha Varisu, Chaalbaaz : Rajni did this film just for Sridevi. He was in an extended cameo role and many more. Farishtey (1991): The last film in which they had worked together. When Sridevi passed away Rajnikanth was very sad, in his emotional statement he said, “ In front of camera and behind the camera, there were two Sridevis. Behind the screen she was very unassuming, she used to listen to everything. In front of the camera she was like a fire, an electric power would pass. That's how she would act. At the same time, she had never got angry on anyone. When she went to Hindi film industry, she didn't know a word of Hindi. She surprised everyone with the ease and effortlessness with which she performed there. She is a born actor. This is a big, big, big loss to Indian film industry. I have a very few close friends, among them Sridevi was one. I have lost her. My heart is very heavy.” Likewise, since from the begining upto the end Rajnikanth and Sridevi's friendship was genuine.

Here are some benefits of each: Benefits of a wide display: 1. Enhanced multitasking: A wide display, often with an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 21:9, provides additional horizontal screen real estate. This extra width allows for better multitasking by enabling you to have multiple windows or applications open side by side without overlapping or crowding. 2. Productivity boost: With a wide display, you can view more content simultaneously, which can enhance productivity. It's especially useful for tasks that involve working with multiple documents, spreadsheets, or editing videos or images. The wider workspace allows for easier comparison, referencing, and manipulation of content. 3. Immersive entertainment: Many movies, TV shows, and games are designed to take advantage of a wider aspect ratio. A wide display can offer a more immersive experience by filling your field of vision and providing a broader viewing angle, making it particularly appealing for cinematic experiences and gaming. 4. Better document and web browsing: The wider screen allows you to view documents, web pages, and emails with less scrolling and zooming, providing a more natural reading experience. It reduces the need to constantly switch between different sections of a document or webpage. Benefits of a bigger display: 1. Larger content viewing: A bigger display, usually measured in diagonal inches, offers a larger canvas for content consumption. Whether you're watching movies, viewing photos, or browsing the web, a bigger display can showcase the content in a visually impactful manner, with larger text, images, and videos. 2. Improved readability: If you have visual impairments or prefer larger text, a bigger display can be advantageous. It allows you to increase the font size without sacrificing the amount of content visible on the screen. This can be beneficial for reading books, articles, or any text-heavy material. 3. Enhanced visual detail: A larger display can present finer details more prominently. Whether you're editing photos or videos, analyzing intricate designs, or simply appreciating high-resolution content, a bigger screen can make it easier to see and work with minute elements. 4. Greater screen immersion: While a wide display offers a wider field of view, a bigger display can provide a heightened sense of immersion. This is especially true for activities like gaming or watching movies where the larger screen can make you feel more engaged in the content. Ultimately, the choice between a wide display and a bigger display depends on your individual needs, preferences, and the primary tasks you intend to perform. It's worth considering the specific aspect ratio, resolution, and size options available in the market to find the display that best suits your requirements."},{"prompt":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","completion":"The most popular and misunderstood picture you are going to see and read the story about this picture.

Lange took the photo, which came to be called “Migrant Mother,” for a project commissioned by the New Deal’s Federal Resettlement Administration (later part of the Farm Security Administration) to document the plight of migrant agricultural workers. Her image of Owens soon was published in newspapers, prompting the government to deliver food aid to the Nipomo camp, where several thousand people were hungry and living in squalid conditions; however, by that point Owens and her family had moved on. Lange’s photo became a defining image of the Great Depression, but the migrant mother’s identity remained a mystery to the public for decades because Lange hadn’t asked her name. In the late 1970s, a reporter tracked down Owens (whose last name was then Thompson), at her Modesto, California, home. Thompson was critical of Lange, who died in 1965, stating she felt exploited by the photo and wished it hadn’t been taken and also expressing regret she hadn’t made any money from it.

You see, if an undemocratic leader controls the resources, they can simply pay off their military and give patronage to the powerful people in their country, and they don’t need to bother about the common citizens. But it doesn’t take too long to think it through. Can you think of any nations run by dictators, where the people are poor, the people in power are abusive, and they don’t have any particularly valuable resources? I knew you could. Yeah, the curse is just having a shitty government."},{"prompt":"w does financial auditing work?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: accounting and auditing dubai ] [URL: https://ublauditing.com/]Although you can feel like you're in the limelight during an audit of your financial statements, the procedure's goal is to reassure your stakeholders that management has presented a \\"true and fair\\" representation of the company's financial status.

At no time in history could a private creditor of the US government enforce their right to be paid with a fixed amount of gold, and the Supreme Court put the final nail in that coffin under FDR. What Nixon did was accept the reality of deficit spending and inflation. The Breton Woods agreement had been broken for more than a decade, but countries got around that by not demanding to redeem foreign currency for gold. When France starting demanding redemptions Nixon had no choice but to shut the window. As for “conservatives,” I see no evidence that current politicians, Democrat or Republican, has the political will needed to balance the Federal Budget as a gold standard would require in the long run. As soon as both Bush and Trump had control of Congress, they pushed through tax cuts without significant spending cuts. Without real budget constraints, a gold standard is a pipe dream. With such constraints, it’s not needed."},{"prompt":"f you were 80 and you had the option to become 30 again, would you do it?","completion":"I am 50 and I would love to be 30 again.

If I had my time again I would be braver in my decision making."},{"prompt":"Why did NASA quarantine astronauts who landed on the moon?","completion":"Back in the 1960s, there was all kinds of speculation regarding what we might find on the moon. Some thought there could be some sorts of microbes which of course humans would have no natural immunities to whatsoever (look at our panicked response to COVID; just imagine how it would be if there really WAS an outbreak of something that would kill pretty much anything in its path). So they quarantined the astronauts who successfully reached the moon on the earlier missions. Eventually, we realized there was nothing; the moon harbors no form of life whatsoever, not even the tiniest of living things. So the astronauts on the later missions were not required to quarantine, and if we returned men to the moon again now, there would be no quarantine either."},{"prompt":"Can I use my HomePod (375) for instudio speakers?","completion":"You will be laughed out of any professional recording studio if you attempt to use a Bluetooth speaker to monitor a mix.

For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer.","completion":"First, try to de-escalate it. Talk to him. If it doesn’t work, take him down. In the past, the training with the baton was more pain and compliance than breaking bones. So, you could block but also use it to inflict pain on nerve points or use locks that limit mobility. One that almost always worked was to but the baton up between the man’s legs, either holding it horizontally and using your forearm or to use the side handle on the PR24 to put pressure on his testicles. Lift up and he’s in pain and you can push him forward or pull him back. Of course, you had to get close to do this. Strikes to the bony parts, ten to the joints, and finally, dangerous and lethal strikes, were available. One officer was a threat, two usually had the edge, three won. Multiple impacts tended to incapacitate long enough to arrest. Now, you also have Tasers and Pepper Spray that can do the same, from further away. Of course, you can always point your weapon at him. Funny how that tends to calm some down, knowing they’re facing death. Others get more aggressive, but it still puts them down. For us, unarmed men couldn’t be shot unless they had proven themselves a threat. A boxer is, but has he killed? A martial artist was, even if he hadn’t, but you can’t catch a bullet in your teeth. Military types, then and now, are feared, but usually safe. So, I would be hard pressed to bring a weapon into the fight unless he was winning against four officers who had already used the baton, Taser, and Pepper Spray. Then I could expect heat from the media and supervisors since he was still unarmed. But, at least we tried everything. But, in domestics, your worry isn’t always the man."},{"prompt":"Do you think you have ever met a Russian spy?","completion":"I don’t think I have met any Russians.

There is no one single word about race in that poem as well, so it’s a real mystery how someone could far-fetch it to racism. You can say it’s old-fashioned, maybe it doesn’t meet modern standards in some ways, or perhaps you personally don’t find its message right and helpful, but for goodness sake, not everything that fails to amuse you can be considered “racist”."},{"prompt":"What are the steps in writing a dissertation?","completion":"Discussion section in dissertation writing shows that what you’re trying to do and how you have structured the findings.

I have many friends and neighbors that caved in and left here to move to a larger city. “I just cannot pass up this job offer with a great salary — more than double what I am making now!” was a common reason cited. Every one moved back within 2–3 years, all with the same story. They couldn’t stand the city any more. The constant noise, crowds, crime, intolerance, selfishness, and cost of living. They found that after expenses, their disposable income was about the same, and the standard of living in the rural areas was far higher. The frisco and LA residents all boast about how they can be in the mountains or the beach within an hour’s drive. Big deal! I walk to the end of my block and be in the forest.

It does not own any house. The houses lots that the developer originally put into the HOA are bound by that contract of the HOA and it encumbers the property and passes along to all future owners of the property. So, if a title search failed to find and identify an HOA attaching to your property, then there is a good chance none so exists. HOAs are well known for trying to claim that all properties in their neighborhood are part of the HOA. The HOAs are frequently wrong, as any property not part of the devopment that created the HOA won’t be part of it unless the property owner subsequently agreed to join and burden their property with the HOA contract as an encumbrance. That the HOA claims it is, simply means you should demand they show proof of a legally recorded deed encumbering your property. Now, if in fact your title search did make a mistake, then as to the property being encumbered by an HOA agreement .. it is what it is. That encumbrance does not go away simply because your title search made an error. Of course if you got title insurance based on that title report and the insurance did not make an exception for an HOA encumbrance, they you have a claim against the insurance. If you have the title report but no insurance, then if the company that furnished the title report is in error, you have a lawsuit against them. You certainly might begin by contacting that title report company and informing them that the HOA asserts it encumbers your property and see what the report company has to say in response and what actions they offer to undertake to clear or quiet your title. If the title company assures you there is no HOA encumbrance, then your response to the HOA should include that fact and a demand by you that they withdraw their claim as it is a “slander of title” against your property and you will hold then responsible for damages if they continue without clearing that claim of encumbrance."},{"prompt":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","completion":"Hey, im glad you asked If you you want to get [LINKED_TEXT: CHEAP FLIGHTS WITH CASH BACK] [URL: http://tinyurl.com/eztravel1] & BEST HOTELS DEALS Cashback on tickets make flights up to 5% cheaper 💸💸 Cashback on hotels save up to 10% on your stays 🏷🏷 Travel experts around-the-clock support 🚄⛴️✈️ Diamond Hidden gems and insightful tips from locals💎💎 JUST CLICK HERE🔽🔽🔽🔽 [LINKED_TEXT: ACT NOW PRICE IS GOING UP SOON] [URL: http://tinyurl.com/eztravel1]!!

I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right. There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority."},{"prompt":"Should I purchase Marrow notes or prepare notes by myself as a secondyear MBBS student?","completion":"As a second year MBBS student, please read Robbins, Ananthanarayan, Paniker, Narayan Reddy and Tripati.

We once had two very worldly, right-on, sophisticated Californian colleagues come over and the lady, in particular, wanted to try some “real English food.” That’s fair enough and we were proud to meet her wishes. My wife and I took the pair to a real, formica tabled, bench seated English fish and chip shop - an establishment of the very highest order, worthy of six Michelin stars on the chip shop rating. The steak and kidney pudding was superb, made with a real suet case and steamed - packed full of steak, kidney and juicy gravy. With it were blanched chips and mushy peas. Nothing in the world could beat this gastronomic masterpiece. Her reaction was horror that were going to eat what she called offal. Worse than that offal which had infected the chips and what she described as green sludge: that was the mushy peas. She refused to go near a single mouth full whilst her male colleague just prodded at the pudding and ate three chips. In the end, we bought an Eccles cake for her - which is all that she had for lunch. When she complained that she was starving half way through the afternoon meeting, I had no sympathy for her - none, as in zero!

The story was not intended to be critical of Americans. I have spent too much time in that wonderful country to ever be anything than a huge fan of Americans. What the post seems to have done is to expose the great hidden secret of British cuisine – and that is its quiet, unrecognised strength. I cook every night and it is my great pleasure. My cooking is simple, straightforward English food a million, million miles away from mass produced supermarket packet food, takeaways of dubious quality and the artificial excellence of TV shows with their culinary art. I put a meal on the table every night in about 30 minutes – simple ingredients, cooked simply and without any affectations. Tonight, we have had lamb which I cooked in English cider with Rosemary from our garden. I used the jus to flavour the mashed potatoes: cheap, simple and delicious.

On average, though, meteoroids zip through our solar system at speeds ranging from about 25,000 to 160,000 miles per hour (40,000 to 257,500 kilometers per hour). As it plummets toward the ground, the meteoroid is subjected to intense friction and pressure, which cause it to heat up and start glowing – transforming it into a meteor. During this process, the meteor's speed is affected by several factors, including its size, shape, and the density of the atmosphere. While meteors can still reach incredible speeds as they streak through Earth's atmosphere, their velocity generally decreases due to the drag force acting against them. It's difficult to pinpoint an exact average speed for meteors after entering the atmosphere, as it can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances. However, it's safe to say that they're still moving at a breakneck pace – often tens of thousands of miles per hour – as they light up the night sky."},{"prompt":"Brie Larson wants to do an all female Avengers movie. Do you think there should be an all female Avengers movie and would you go watch it?","completion":"But Out of the gate with zero context or references to the original printed comic source material, I would feel that an all Female roster of superheroes to fulfill the Avengers charter would feel “forced” and unrealistic. It can come off as offensive to fans just as the latest controversy over Kathleen Kennedy’s The Last Jedi feeling forced to insert women heroes who Haven’t earned their place with the fans. The best analogy would be the conscious effort to hire an all female local police department.. why? Or an all female squadron of navy seals… is infiltration of an enemy’s territory going to be a stage to make a feminist statement? I believe of the creator of compelling characters- female and male. Primary female superhero leads with their own titles are in short abundance. To be fair to both the feminist movement and not stir up controversy in a force manner, I would keep the Avengers roster in tact as a mixed group. If Marvel were to promote or advance other female leads,INVEST in giving them credibility via guest appearance, a new comic title and animation etc.. It shows respect to fans to put creative energy in reinvigorating She-Hulk, Captain Marvel and even Rogue of the X-Men as her story with Danvers is a huge part of Marvel lore.

I started vaping for a whole different reason. I’m a stress eater. I've been fat since I was four or five years old. Other than surgery, I've tried everything. Cabbage soup diet, metabolife pills, running in the swimming pool six days a week, weight lifting, south beach, Atkins, sugar busters, slim fast, bulimia… I weigh over 400 pounds but when I started vaping 0 mg nicotine flavors about two months ago, I found I could flip the bird at candy and ice cream and cake and keep on moving. My problem wasn't so much amount of food as type. Sometimes I only eat once a day but when that “meal” is some donuts or half an Italian cream cake it adds up. One large chocolate extreme blizzard at Dairy Queen is 1100 calories. You'd be amazed how many calories you can get from certain items. Now that I vape when stressed instead of stress eating my weight is coming down naturally….without risky surgeries, crazy pills like adipex, the anorexia I tried out for two weeks, restrictive and stressful diets…i had been on that roller coaster since I was a child. Like literally 9 or ten years old. i try to eat the kinds of things humans are supposed to eat—fruit, fish, veggies, nuts, lean meats—for hunger and vape for all my taste craving needs. May not work if what you're craving is pizza but since mine was always sugar it works for me. I don't even inhale it—i roll the vapor around in my mouth and blow it out, getting all the taste with none of the calories. If I feel like I just have to chew there's sugar free gum. Through zamplebox and vapewild.com I can do it on the cheap and it's cheaper than getting diabetes and having to buy meds and insulin (I'm a nurse. Trust me, that shits sky high. Not to mention if you don't control diabetes, dialysis, amputations, blindness…I don't have diabetes or high blood pressure by some miracle but I certainly don't want them). I mever have to stay hungry, but my energy levels are rising and my weight is dropping. And flavors?! There's Irish cream, honey, ice cream flavors, cake and cookie flavors, popsicle flavors, cereal flavors, candy and gum and cotton candy…in my next zamplebox I'm even trying a flavor with some lavender (I like lavender chocolate and earl grey tea so I'm thinking I might like this ejuice). might not work for everyone. If your problem is that you're physically hungry all the time, maybe gastric sleeve is for you, because it does take away a part of your stomach that produces hunger hormones. If your problem is stress eating sugar? Gastric sleeve won't work unless you get your mind right. There are people who have had the surgery and not lost weight because their eating problem is psychological, not physiological. Mine is definitely psych. Thyroids are perfect. vaping helps me get my nutrition on a more sane level. I'll be interested to see if the effect continues."},{"prompt":"What is it like to have a good/best friend of the opposite gender?","completion":"Yeh !

I'm 16 and I smoke about 14 cigs a day so far. If my mom is right, why would I bother to quit?","completion":"It’s not an on-off switch. The longer you smoke, the more likely you’ll have serious consequences for your health. My grandmother had lung cancer three times, but only recovered twice. Recovered is a relative thing. They had to remove a good chunk of one of her lungs. The last time I saw her, she was terrified, bloated with fluid, and unable to talk. And have you seen the people who’ve lost their vocal chords to smoking? To talk, they have to hold a buzzing gadget up to their throat. It sounds weird, though they can be understood. How about the people who have to drag around a tank of supplemental oxygen? (BTW, you have to be really careful with that stuff. It makes things far more flammable.) There are a FEW long term smokers who are lucky enough that their health hasn’t been destroyed, but that’s not the way to bet. In the short term, no matter how lucky you are, you stink. At least to anyone who isn’t a smoker and has a sense of smell. Consider this if you want to go on dates. I don’t mean that as an insult, it’s just true of all habitual smokers, including the ones who are wonderful human beings.

A quality speaker should be able to reproduce the subtle nuances of human speech, such as intonation, breathy sounds, and other vocal subtleties. The kind of speaker you choose should be able to accurately reproduce the range of frequencies generated by the human voice.

Other peoples settled there, and Appalachians settled in other parts of Texas, too, but that’s where the biggest concentration of them are. It’s a little like the Old South that way. Both the Gulf Coast and the Dallas area are more cosmopolitan, as those two areas have grown tremendously in the 20th century. The Houston area is extraordinarily diverse, with large black, Hispanic, and Asian populations. Over 70 languages are spoken in homes in this region. Central Texas has a strong German heritage. It was a focal point for German immigration in the latter half of the 19th century. Southern Texas has a heavy Mexican influence. This extends as far north as San Antonio but is very predominant in the lower Rio Grande valley. West Texas is so sparsely settled that you can’t say most west Texans are from anywhere. Somewhat the same, but less so, for the Panhandle, up by Lubbock and Amarillo. But east Texas is so Appalachian that it hurts. It’s an interesting mix in Nacogdoches, which is an old Caddo Indian settlement that became a Spanish mission town that became an east Texas Anglo settlement."},{"prompt":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","completion":"3 IDIOTS"},{"prompt":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","completion":"Plan for Ev Vehicle.

At that point he’d likely force Hit to use his full set of killing techniques just to stay in the game, but much like in his rematch with Jiren he’d be incapacitated by the backlash right at the last moment and Hit would eliminate him. From there the rest of the arc goes the same besides Goku vowing that the next time they meet he’d be able to use Ultra Instinct on his own. Goku and Vegeta would attempt to use that power in training against Whis but would fail, and this would lead into the Zamasu arc. Zamasu would obviously take Goku’s body, hoping to use UI for himself, and with SSJ Rose’ dominating them the first time round Goku would train with Whis in the HTC to control UI. By the time they go in for round 2, Goku would have the ability to use UI at will and dominate Black to the point where he has to use SSJ2 Rose’ just to gain the upper hand. Then he pisses Goku off with the knowledge of his dark deeds, but Goku controls those emotions and uses that to propel himself into using MUI for the very first time. He drops Black and forces Zamasu to retreat before his body gives out, and they all retreat to the past again. Black, pride wounded due to his inability to get Ultra Instinct, would tell Zamasu to go to another timeline, get another Zamasu, and merge with him, because their plan isn’t done yet. In the meantime, Black would push himself to further develop his raw power. Goku would focus on developing the Mafuba, while Vegeta and Trunks would train in the HTC together, unlocking Limit Breaker and SSJ Ikari respectively. Basically this means both teams would retreat in order to get stronger for round 3. When they do decide to fight, Vegeta would face Black while the Zamasus would face Goku and Trunks. At one point Goku and Zamasu would attempt to seal away the immortal one, only for the other Zamasu to use the Hakai and erase their would-be container. Trunks tries to kill this version of Zamasu but he easily dodges every attack with perfect precision and knocks him back. Goku and Trunks switch targets which forces those versions of Zamasu to fuse (Black and Vegeta are fighting evenly this whole time BTW). Black then teleports over to Zamasu in order to finally fuse with him, and from there everything basically plays out the same as in canon, only with MUI Vegito vs UI/UE Merged Zamasu. The time between Zamasu and the ToP would have Vegeta learn the powers of a GoD until Bulma’s pregnancy requires him to be there. Meanwhile Goku would train with Whis to use UI in all his forms, which would help him beat Hit outright in the rematch. The prep time for the ToP would go the exact same besides Goku matching Justice Toppo with just Blue and Vegeta being ready to unlock UE. The ToP would pretty much go the same (besides Goku in Base clowning on the Trio of Danger and Kale) until his first fight with Jiren, which would be closer to how the rematch went instead, only with Toppo and Frieza knocking off Goku and Jiren respectively. Toppo would use his full GoD power and Hit would fight him, ultimately coming out on top and retreating to recuperate while Frieza eliminates Cabba. From there Gohan and Piccolo fight Kale and Caulifla, using their cooperation to eliminate Kefla. Then from there things go basically the same except for the finale being Universe 7 vs Hit instead of Jiren and Vegeta/Frieza knocking Hit off instead of Goku/Frieza vs Jiren. The Broly movie kinda goes the same, only with them using MUI/UE to combat Broly instead of Gogeta. The Moro arc would kinda start the same but change half-way through due to both Goku and Vegeta going to Yardrat to train with Merus instead of training separately. From there they crush Moro completely. After that the Granolah arc doesn’t change at all."},{"prompt":"Can you fly anywhere with a private pilot license?","completion":"My answer pertains to the USA. The rules are different in other places. You can go almost everywhere, but there are some restrictions. For most military bases, a landing requires permission in advance. This is PPR prior permission required. Different bases have different policies and rules. Some bases are jointly used by civilian and military aircraft and these provide interesting views of planes you don’t often get to see up close. There are certain areas that are restricted. In some cases you can fly over the restricted area as long as you are above a certain altitude, such as 4000 feet. Some airports are privately owned and you must have permission to land there. I never bother with these. If you want to fly above 18,000 feet, you must have an instrument rating and be flying on an instrument flight plan. My little plane won’t go much over 13,000 feet so I never worry about that. Sometimes there are temporary restrictions due to things like forest fires or visits by the President. These are usually short term. POTUS only ties things up for a day or so around here. If you want to cross an international border, you have to follow some procedures. These are not that difficult. In Canada, your ADS-B out equipment must be of a specific type. The inexpensive equipment I have does not qualify. So, I can’t fly into Canada in my plane. There are some areas of air space that require specific permission to enter. This is the air space that surrounds major airports and is called Bravo Airspace. If you want to fly into this area, you have to have a specific clearance. I never try to land at big airports but sometimes I fly past them, and I file an IFR flight plan for that. I get clearance to fly the plan, and this allows me to do it. You could request a Bravo transition with just a private pilot license. There are some large airports that are busy with airliner traffic. You need to arrange ahead of time for a landing slot. The available slots are generally all filled in advance by airline traffic. So, you can’t fly in there in a small plane. The speed mismatch between large and small aircraft makes it difficult for controllers, so, they probably tell you to land somewhere else in a small, slow plane like mine. I live near San Francisco and the airport there is an example. A large aircraft is taking off or landing about every 60 seconds. In general, private pilot license lets you go to the places you want to go. Smaller, convenient airports close to your destination. Since I fly mostly for fun, my destination is typically the restaurant at the airport so I can have lunch!"},{"prompt":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","completion":"I have Mention World best places in 2023 to be Visted in details in My Blog as given Below: [LINKED_TEXT: World Best Places to be Visited in 2023-2024/Best tourist place/Beautiful places in world/Amazing Places/Natural BeautyAre you are planning for Visiting new places then you must go herehttps://informativeideashosting.blogspot.com/2023/06/embarking-on-journey-to-explore-world.html] [URL: https://informativeideashosting.blogspot.com/2023/06/embarking-on-journey-to-explore-world.html]"},{"prompt":"What is the most dangerous place on Earth?","completion":"A plastic surgeon with a sense of humour"},{"prompt":"Should I read Chetan Bhagat's new book 'Girl in Room 105'? Is it as bad as his previous books?","completion":"I’m not a big fan of Chetan Bhagat. And here's my review of his new book. I won't spoil the story to you too much, but frankly speaking, it is a new genre Chetan has written into. It isn’t a love story, but a crime story. The protagonist of the story, Keshav was in love with a Muslim girl Zara. They broke up, but Keshav still had strong feelings for her ex. One night, he received texts from her ex, Zara and went to meet her in her IIT hostel, but found her dead. That was the point from where thrill got started. Rest of the story revolves around how Keshav finds the culprit of his ex's murder. PROS OF THE BOOK: (1) After reading around 50 pages, you'll start witnessing thrill in the story. (2) Most importantly, whatever facts and locations Chetan has used in the story, they are completely relevant to reality. For example, the picturization of Kashmir and its locations are realistic. Also, Chetan researched many kinds of stuff before penning things down. (3) The book also highlights the social problems like problems faced in inter-community marriages. (4) The characters are explained elaborately. It’s so extensive that you'll easily start picturising the events. (5) The language used is simple and easily understandable. Basic knowledge of English will suffice. (6) Although the whole book is a thriller, the last 100 pages will thrill you to a new level of excitement. (7) There is a pure north Indian touch to the story. Also, the story talks about some dark desires of a modern girl through Zara (if you know what I mean). This topic was more comprehensive in Chetan's previous book, but you'll find a subtle put about this topic here also. (8) Common people can easily relate to the story as it is sewed with conversations used in common life. (9) For the first time, Chetan efficiently picturised Kashmir (When Keshav find linkages to the murder in Kashmir, he pays a visit to the state.) He also tried to provide a glimpse of basic problems of Kashmir and why people of Kashmir hate or love the Indian Army. (10) Chetan was successful in writing a great novel for the people who insist on reading something in this genre. Linkages of Zara's murder leap from person to person, creating curiousness. CONS: (1) The start of the story is very slow. First few pages bored me. (2) Some events are either over-stated or larger than life. (3) The over-ambition of Zara's sexual desire is a bit exaggerated, Zara being a Muslim. In majority cases, girls or even for that matter boys, don't hold that kind of dank feelings. Nevertheless, we can say the time is changing. (4) When you'll find the murderer, at last, you'll wonder how come the murderer murdered the girl so easily and the police weren't able to find even a leak in it. The police jailed someone innocent. (5) Lastly, when the murderer explains the modus-operandi of the murder, it feels way too overstated. I've talked about the pros and cons without spoiling the story too much. If you're ok with the cons, I would say this book should be read and liked."},{"prompt":"What are the arguments for and against whether a human fertilized egg at the moment of conception is a person or not?","completion":"There is no doubt that the embryo is human in the sense that it has human DNA, but so do the zillions of skin cells you shed every day.

The damage was nearly catastrophic. 1 sailor was killed outright and almost the entire crew suffered some form of injury. Many severely. USS Connecticut also struck a seamount, but at a much slower patrol speed and at an unknown depth. The crew only suffered a handful of minor injuries, bumps and bruises. The damage to the sub appears to be nothing compared to San Francisco. There is some damage to the forward ballast tank and from satellite images it appears as though the whole reinforced fiberglass bow sonar dome is missing. The Spherical array itself appears to still be in place but the dome cover is gone. If you look at the 2nd photo of San Francisco, you'll note how the crush damage is mostly on the port(left) side of the sub and the Starboard(right) side is mostly intact except for the missing sonar dome. I imagine if we were to see Connecticut in drydock it would look similar to San Francisco's Starboard side, but on both port and starboard. Without the crush damage to the port side."},{"prompt":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule?

Cons: Overconsumption can lead to impaired judgment, coordination, and motor skills, which can increase the risk of accidents, injuries, and even death.Long-term heavy use can lead to liver disease, high blood pressure, and other health problems.It can be addictive and lead to dependence. Marijuana: Pros: It can help alleviate symptoms of certain medical conditions, such as chronic pain, nausea, and anxiety.It can have positive effects on mood and can temporarily reduce anxiety and depression.It has a lower risk of overdose compared to alcohol. Cons: It can impair judgment, coordination, and motor skills, which can increase the risk of accidents, injuries, and even death, especially when driving or operating heavy machinery.Long-term heavy use can lead to respiratory problems and can affect memory and concentration.It can be addictive and lead to dependence. It's worth noting that both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects on mental health, especially in individuals with a predisposition to mental illness or those who use these substances excessively. It's important to use both substances responsibly and in moderation. Additionally, it's essential to comply with local laws and regulations regarding the use of these substances."},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"This is a good one. I have struggled with this all my life, starting from early adult life. Take the example of infidelity or relationship shenanigans. If I know something someone doesn’t know about their date, partner, or spouse, should I tell them? What if it’s a few days before their engagement or wedding? What if they are terribly sad and lonely, and the relationship has lifted their spirits, or changed their life? Here’s my take. If I can “save someone from some fate”, whether a broken heart, or a dinged wallet, I should do it. I think it is in their best interests that I do it. Sometimes, it will backfire, and in fact the decision may negatively impact my relationship with them. In spite of this, I should still do it. What about situations outside of love and relationships? Do you tell someone the truth in connection with your observations about them (which of course can’t help but have a judgmental aspect about them) or not? Here’s my take. It is in someone’s best interests to know how you think, so they can defend themselves, or reflect on what you have said and course correct, we should go ahead and do it. If we all go round walking on eggshells with each other, only talking behind backs, all of us will go around with less self-awareness, less chance to understand how other people see us, and less opportunity to reflect and change our ways!"},{"prompt":"w do I become an official novelist and get my novel published?","completion":"There is no such thing as an official novelist. No credentials are involved. You are a novelist if you write novels. As for how you get your novel published, there are two routes: traditional publishing and self-publishing (sometimes called “indie publishing”). To get your novel traditionally published, you must convince a publisher that publishing it will be profitable. This means either submitting it directly to an acquiring editor at that publisher’s office, or convincing an agent to represent you and having her submit it for you. Many (but not all) publishers nowadays only read novels submitted by agents, not directly by writers. Editors and agents receive hundreds, maybe thousands, of novels every year and reject well over 90% of them — not necessarily because they’re bad (though most of them are) but because they don’t appear commercial; they don’t look as if they’ll sell enough copies to justify the cost of production. For self-publishing, you go to one of several online services and follow the instructions; you’re acting as your own publisher, so you don’t need to get past an agent or editor. The biggest and best-known self-publishing site is Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (kdp.amazon.com), but there are others: Draft 2 Digital, Barnes & Noble Press, Ingram Spark, etc. Most offer a basic service for free, with add-ons available for a fee; Ingram Spark has no free option. KDP has clear, step by step instructions. So do most of the others. Be aware that while a handful of self-published authors get rich, the vast majority only sell a few copies. There are tens of thousands of them; most sell less than a hundred copies."},{"prompt":"When is the right time to hire a virtual assistant for your Amazon Fba business?","completion":"An Amazon Virtual Assistant is a person which can handle your business virtually and takes full responsibility of your business.

Python and R often have machine learning libraries that are written in C/C++/Cuda and other libraries written in Fortran - the python code is usually only needed/used for setup, but most of the numerical work is done in the C/C++/Cuda/Fortran libraries. So you aren’t losing much speed using the python libraries. Higher level languages are better for learning machine learning (according to Andrew Ng who teaches machine learning using Octave/Mathematica and has tried teaching machine learning in lower level languages and discovered that students learn fastest with higher level languages) because you can implement the core algorithms more quickly and efficiently, explore variations etc. You likely also benefit from a decreased cognitive load."},{"prompt":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","completion":"A YouTube Cash Cow Business is an automated YouTube business where channel owners upload faceless YouTube videos with the hope of making money from them. These YouTube channels are run by creators who produce content that can bring in a sizable monthly income from the platform but never reveal their identities to the public. Chase Namic, a successful businessman who claims to have more than 20 YouTube channels, coined the term “cash cow YouTube channel.” A Cash Cow YouTube channel, according to him, is made “only with the intention of making money.” They are essentially YouTube channels that try to get as many views as they can in order to make money (since YouTube pays per thousand views) It’s not a new way of making money, but it has been completely untapped. Success in it requires good niche selection, above-average video editing skills, careful topic selection, promotion, and consistency. These channels are the ideal business model for anyone looking for a highly flexible passive income on the internet because they are basically run with the sole intent of making money and are created with great innovation. A lot of people are embracing this trend since, instead of making the videos themselves, they’re simply hiring a team to do it for them. And this turns your YouTube channel into a legitimate business rather than just a personal one.

A string is an object with many degrees of freedom, the harmonics. When strings were introduced, new particles were being discovered so often that is seemed as if there were no fundamental particles at all. A fraction of physicists tried to abandon field theory and work directly with the S matrix. Collisions between protons were producing resonances, that is unstable particles, and that all these particles had a spin proportional to their mass squared. On a spin, mass squared plot, resonances lined up to form a straight line, the Regge trajectory. Shortly after, a formula for S matrix was found, and a mathematical analysis of that formula revealed that it involved the creation and destruction operators of an infinite number of degrees of freedom. It was proposed that the simplest of such models would be a string. String theory took a turn when it was found that the spectrum of strings contained a spin 2 particle, the graviton. Hopes that string theory would succeed at unifying quantum field theory and gravity, lead string theory to develop at rapid pace, until it was found (1989) that string theory was essentially non-perturbative. The theory had too many possible vacua. This lead to the study of non-perturbative structures in spacetime, that is membranes. Not doing research in this field I cant tell you more. String theory is not a theory like Quantum Field Theory, in which contact is made with experiments with the help of formulas that connect the theory’s fundamental objects, and observables such as cross-sections. There really is a problem here. Having many vacua is unacceptable, it means the theory is not unique. String theory is the only theory that succeeded in computing the entropy of a black hole by counting the number of degrees of freedom. I encourage you to study string theory because of the wealth of concepts that it contains."},{"prompt":"What TV series are worth watching?","completion":"The Office (US)2. Breaking Bad3.

For an undergraduate degree, you can not apply to both. Secondly, you apply to study a subject. Your personal statement won’t do much, as generally they measure something that the Universities aren’t interested in. In the UK the fact that your parents paid for ballet lessons won’t give you a head start over somebody who did a Saturday job to make ends meet. At the end of the day it’s your exam grades which matter. Apart from certain high-profile events such as the Boat Race, nobody gives a shit about how good you are at sport. However if you have something which support your application to study your chosen subject then your personal statement might help. For instance, if you want to study to be a Vet, then your personal statement will describe the fact that for the last three or four years, you helped out in the Summer Holidays at a local vet practice (and they will be one of your referees to back this up) and what you learned there will be relevant. If you didn’t bother to do that then this will count against you when it comes down to choosing between two candidates of the same exam grades. If you want to study medicine then all of that time in the last three to four years that you spent volunteering with the Red Cross or St. John Ambulance will definitely help, especially when you describe how you dealt with various medical emergencies when helping at big events, such as big fun runs or at big sporting events. A description (again supported by a referee) of how you saved somebody’s life using CPR when they were having a heart attack and how you stopped yourself from panicking will definitely help. Didn’t do that and want to be a medic? Well, that shows lack of motivation and / or initiative doesn’t it? Would-be medics and vets will have been volunteering for years before their A-levels to show their commitment. Otherwise your personal statement means very little. Your sporting achievements mean precisely nothing unless you have an Olympic medal or two to show for it. Might help at postgrad if you are an Olympic standard rower (with medals to prove it) which might assist you to get a PhD placement, if your degree is good enough in that subject and you also want to take part in the Boat Race. Bluntly to get into either institution you need to start with top grades and accept that there’s about 10 applicant with top grades for each place for the easiest courses to get in to."},{"prompt":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","completion":"There’s way more to marijuana than the classic “stoner high”.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

The U.S. and Sweden have the largest healthcare programs, which proportionately show increases in laziness, which is linked to depression, obesity, lack of discipline, suicide and many other issues.

With a hope to change the way of teaching in government schools, she dreams to mitigate the gap in the quality of education that one receives in private schools.She was recently awarded the best teacher award and took the prize from students. Many a time, we hear that government schools in small towns and villages lack the basic facilities that often hinders the academic progress of the students. Repetitive pleading for extra funds may not be approved on time and might stall the smooth functioning inside a classroom. Thus, without waiting for a help from the government, a Tamil Nadu school teacher sold off her own jewellery to meet the expense and make her classroom fit for her students. Why should only students in urban school have all high-tech facilities, right? So, Annapurna Mohan, a Class 3 English teacher at a school in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram town has given her classroom an international look. Her classroom has an interactive smart board, piles of English books, comfortable furniture, that seems like a dream for any classroom under the Panchayat Union Primary School (PUPS) in the state. Not just the high-tech facilities, she also makes sure that her students speak fluent English and there is nothing lacking in their studies just because they study in a Panchayat school. “I tried to create a good environment for English in my classroom. I conversed with my students in English from the beginning of the class till the end. In the beginning, some of them didn’t understand it, but in time, they began to respond,” she told News Minute. The loving teacher feels this is what her students deserve and also tries to implement interactive measures to make her lessons more interesting. She started converting each lesson into short skits, which would then be re-enacted by her students. She later uploaded her students’ performances on [LINKED_TEXT: Facebook] [URL: http://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/] that garnered enough support and praises. “I uploaded a video of a skit on my Facebook, and a teacher saw that and sent a money order of Rs 10 for the student in the video. That student was excited upon getting the money order. And then that student started doing well after being appreciated,” she added. With the help of social media, soon her good work spread across borders and many teachers across the world started helping her. So, to give a digital makeover to her classroom, she did it all on her own in just three days! “I decided to do it by myself because I did not want to burden anyone. Doing it myself also helped to get it done more efficiently, as I did not have to rely on anyone else,” explains Annapurna. With a hope to change the way of teaching in government schools, she dreams to mitigate the gap in the quality of education that one receives in private schools.

Sure Dave! “In the world of fine wine, few names have attracted as much attention and controversy as Rudy Kurniawan. Once dubbed the \\"King of Counterfeit Wine,\\" Kurniawan's journey from being an infamous fraudster to an inspiring figure in the wine industry is a story worth telling. Born in Indonesia, Rudy Kurniawan moved to the United States in the early 2000s, where he quickly gained a reputation as a lavish spender with a discerning palate. His seemingly bottomless pockets and extravagant wine collection soon made him the toast of the town among elite wine connoisseurs. However, behind the veneer of extravagance lay a dark secret. Kurniawan had been meticulously producing counterfeit bottles of rare and expensive wines, fooling even the most experienced oenophiles. In 2012, the FBI arrested Kurniawan, and in 2013, he was convicted for his crimes. But it was during his time in prison that the seeds of redemption began to sprout. Kurniawan devoted himself to learning everything there was to know about wine, from the intricacies of terroir to the art of viticulture. Upon his release in 2021, Kurniawan embarked on an unlikely journey of reinvention. Determined to make amends for his past transgressions, he became an active advocate for transparency and authenticity in the wine industry. His efforts focused on educating collectors and enthusiasts about the importance of provenance and verifying the history of fine wines. One remarkable example of his commitment to this cause was when Kurniawan organized a charity auction to raise funds for victims of a devastating earthquake in Indonesia. He carefully curated a selection of authentic wines from his personal collection and worked tirelessly to ensure their provenance could be verified. The event raised substantial funds for the cause and demonstrated Kurniawan's newfound dedication to integrity in the world of wine. Beyond his advocacy work, Kurniawan has used his unique knowledge and skills to develop innovative tools to combat counterfeiting in the wine industry. He has partnered with experts in the field of technology to create a groundbreaking wine authentication system that combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and advanced chemical analysis. The system has already garnered praise for its potential to revolutionize the industry and protect collectors from fraud. Rudy Kurniawan's transformation from an infamous con man to an inspiring figure is a testament to the power of redemption and the capacity for change. His commitment to righting the wrongs of his past and his dedication to ensuring the integrity of the wine world have earned him the respect and admiration of many in the industry. Today, Kurniawan's story serves as a reminder that even the most unlikely heroes can emerge from the shadows of infamy.”"},{"prompt":"Can we really get a free WhatsApp number?","completion":"I need USA WhatsApp number"},{"prompt":"What does it mean when you dream about a black cat who knocked at your house and came without asking?

I don't know why it's IMDB rating is 9+. Sushant's acting was decent, his screenplay and expressions were appreciable. But, the direction of the movie was poor, things were pacing so fast that I was not able to relate with the characters. Kissi basu's acting was vulnerable, that church speech didn't have any impact over me. That blind friend did an outstanding job, I didn't understand the role of Saif Ali Khan, like his role should have been more clear and obvious. Next, there was no romance, no happy scenes, things were just rushing so fast throughout the movie.

I would say ok, that’s fair. Can I ask what about the dress you don’t particularly like? If she says she “doesn’t do pastels” or something then I would tell her she can pick a darker tone in the pastel range but that’s about effing it. if she says she doesn’t feel comfortable in it, or it’s too revealing, or she doesn’t want to expose a certain body part, etc then I think it’s only fair and kind if you scrap that dress And go looking for another that will make you both happy. It’s less common now for the bride to be the one who picks out the bridesmaids dresses. More commonly nowadays, a bride will “direct” the bridesmaids into finding their own dress. I.e she will ask that they be a dark, navy blue and it’s an ultra formal affair so it needs to be long. Then they can pick sleeve length, fit, neckline, embellishments, etc. I always tell the brides I work with to have the bridesmaids send a photo of the dress on before they actually purchase -so the bride can still veto something inappropriate, scene stealing, hideous or not what she clearly requested. Just compromise! It doesn’t have to be a “my choice or your choice” kind of deal- there billions of dresses out there- surely one exists that will satisfy you both"},{"prompt":"w do I get the birth certificate for my child?","completion":"My mother ws born in Mumbai in 1961 in Santa Cruz mumbai.

I would not want them in the line I’m in to pay for my groceries or my place of employment or a doctor’s waiting room.

And he instantly denied, saying that, “You don't want to save time when you are watching your series/movies/Instagraming. Don't make excuses. Note making may just take 30 mins extra but it is much more effective. And you can afford 30mins/day.” Ofcourse, I was upset. But being stubborn by nature I decided I'll make all of the notes by myself no matter what it takes. And it turns out he was right because of following reasons. Initially it took extra 30 mins and now it doesn't even take any extra time. Instead, I can watch a video on 1.5× and write notes parallelly.It's so much easier to revise. Everytime I open a book to recall, it just flashes right in front of my eyes.University exams are lengthy. My writing speed has increased to such an extent that this time, when almost everyone missed questions on their paper, I was able to finish it before time.I can be 100% sure that everything is covered up in notes. I can totally rely upon them for any exam(even unis) without any 2nd thoughts. There are more benefits than harm. So sometimes going old school in the fast moving world is better. It's little difficult but not impossible if we are willing to. Also, I think there is no shortcut to success.

Also, many nebulae in the sky appear huge from Earth and do not require very much magnification at all. For example, M42, the famous Orion nebula, appears larger than a full moon and will nicely fill your field of view at only 50x.

Is it true that the reforms which pushed for women's rights created many enemies among the predominantly Muslim population aside from Khomeini?","completion":"It wasn’t controversial, and no, women’s rights were neither a flashpoint before 1979 nor a central issue in the revolution. Really, women’s rights haven’t had a major impact on Iranian politics either way. Mohammad Reza Shah was not a reformer, and his regime relied on the support of the Moslem religious authorities to stay in power. Khomeini did not represent a general religious opposition to the regime: he was a radical expelled from the religious circuit, who found a new audience among the common people for going against the Shah. The Shah was controversial for becoming increasingly totalitarian, out-of-touch, and downright delusional. Iran had long had a nominally constitutional regime ([LINKED_TEXT: Constitutional Revolution, 1905–11] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Constitutional_Revolution]) imposed by the clergy and small-time merchants on the old kings. The rise of the Pahlavis as military dictators was made in alliance with the older statesmen to rein in a country that, in the early 20th century, was still basically feudal, and whose modernist political elites saw a violent, autocratic central state as a way to stave off partition. By the 1970s, none of that made sense anymore, and the Shah was in an awkward position in a rapidly modernizing society, as peasants streamed into the cities. The “White Revolution” (here White is in opposition to Red; as in the Russian Civil War) was his programme for economic and military modernization without real political change, preserving power in the court and chief aristocratic families. Most current, popular accounts of the Pahlavis and the White Revolution focus on the bikinis and Westernized hotels, but totally gloss over the really primitive nature of the royal regime. What toppled the Shah in 1979 was overplaying his hand: not understanding that Iranian society would not tolerate him trying to become an autocrat, by the time his father’s old advisors all died out, he tried to install Rastakhiz (‘(National) Revival’) as a one-party state, abolishing the last pretenses to a democracy and installing a government of yes-men. It was not about modernity, or Islam, or women: it was just bad politics 101. Khomeini was the canniest political operator on the scene, who managed to install a large activist network and propaganda machine to tip the scales in his favour during and after the revolution. He did not represent the main party (there was no main party) in the uprising: he just made sure other parties could not react while he “rode the wave” of popular unrest. If you had asked people before the revolution what they stood for and what Khomeini meant to do, not one out of ten would have expected the totality of what happened, and only his students and activists saw his doctrine of Islamic politics as a real option before they gained power. The Islamic laws were what Khomeini wanted to do, not the stated aim of the revolution, or a way to become popular. But his government granted enough of the revolution’s actual aims (a parliament; constitutional law, participation in politics) even if under clerical oversight, combined with becoming heroes in the brutal Iraqi invasion in the so-called Iran-Iraq War (it was Khomeini’s leadership in a national crisis, and the under-equipped ‘martyrs’ brigades’ dying on the field, that made the Islamic Republic universally supported by Iranians in its early years) combined with ruthless removal of political dissidents with a much freer hand than the Shah showed in his later years, that cemented his status."},{"prompt":"What are some delicious South Indian desserts that most North Indians have never heard of?","completion":"I have seen many people saying that south Indian sweets means only payasam, tirupuati ladoo, mysore pak etc.but this is not true So I am going to share a list of sweets from south India.

Who's fault, selector, captain, or coach?","completion":"First things first, Indian Cricket team is jinxed since 2013. I've never got the feeling that India can win a particular tournament since 2013. Of course, I believed in them in 2014 T20 world cup, 2017 Champions trophy and 2019 ODI world cup. Except that, I felt our downfall was on the cards. This time around, I got the signs pretty early in the tournament. Bumrah and Jadeja got ruled out injured. Bumrah might've had a terrible record in knockout games. But against the England lineup, he could've well been a ray of hope. But do we even need to think about that? We lost the match as soon as we entered the middle. It was a good wicket to bat on. Our powerplay score was 38/1. Their powerplay score was 63/0. Further, India were 100/3 after 15 overs. England were already set to finish off the match around 15 overs mark. The pair of Alex Hales and Jos Buttler just came out all guns blazing. We lacked the much needed intent upfront. Our openers are liabilities. They don't fire when we're under pressure. Rohit and Virat probably had less range of shots that stopped them from accelerating in the overs 7–15. England spinners were exceptional. Adil Rashid bowled so well. Livingstone gave hardly anything for the batters. The pitch was a belter. But we struggled to get to a par score. If not for Hardik's knock, we were not even getting to 140. 168 was still about 20 runs below par. Team India looks like having all the skill sets for every tournament. But it's the semifinals and finals where we're losing. I think there isn't any need for analysis to bring this fact to notice. India must address this issue before playing 2023 ODI world cup at home.

Wojtek was a fine chap so I’ll give him a bit of fame on Quora too. It started when he was picked up as a tiny newborn in Iran in 1942 by some Polish soldiers who were forming a Polish division fighting alongside the British army. They had just been released from the Siberian gulags and made an arduous journey to Iran. Many of them had lost their families and were facing an uncertain future, so spirits were low. As they were making their way towards Palestine they found a half starved bear cub. Seeing how their faces lit up the officer in charge allowed them to keep the baby, although it was against army protocol. The officer probably thought that the bear would be a great morale booster and would take their minds off the tragedy they were going through. Judging by their big adoring smiles, he was right : During the long drive the soldiers played with him, mollycoddled him, fed him with some rationed condensed milk using an empty vodka bottle. As he grew a bit older they shared a beer and cigarettes with him. He must have known that “smoking is bad for you” so he used to eat the ciggies instead. He opened beer cans with his claws and he was dexterous enough to use the can by himself. He became a bit of a celebrity and an attraction for soldiers from other units. Especially the female units couldn’t resist visiting the Polish soldiers, just to see the bear, of course :) But Wojtek was not “just a pretty face”! He was a great partner for practising skills of hand to hand combat. He never hurt anyone. He used to draw back his sharp claws when he was boxing and tumbling with the guys. A considerate gentle giant. He was useful as a female substitute in dancing practice too. One of his many achievements was discovering a spy: He used to love soaking himself in water….. (it was hot in the desert for a mountain bear) In Palestine there was a restriction on water usage so he used to try sneaking into the showers at night, when no one was looking. One night he came across an Arab saboteur hiding there. The noise raised by the terrified Arab woke the soldiers. His capture and questioning resulted in some useful information falling into their hands. Wojtek was a great thief deterrent. He always insisted on sitting next to the driver, not in the back. He used to stay sitting in the cab of the truck when the driver was busy elsewhere. Apparently NOTHING ever got stolen from his trucks, while other trucks were robbed regularly. After months on the road the time came to transfer to Italy. Animals were not allowed on the ship so the Polish general secured official army papers for Wojtek. Wojtek became an army private (some reports say – a corporal) and started getting soldiers’ rations. In fact he was getting double rations because of his size - he weighed 485 kg by then. AFAIK he is the only bear in the world ever registered as an army soldier. Off to Italy! : At Monte Casino his unit had to unload many consignments of ammunition. Wojtek was not bothered by the smoke and the constant sound of shelling going off around him. After watching the soldiers lift and carry the boxes Wojtek decided to join in. He was great help until he got bored with it. No one tried to force him. It was all his own good will. One of the soldiers commemorated his help with the ammunition by turning it into their unit logo: After the war Polish soldiers were stationed in Scotland while they were waiting for the political situation to become clear. Most of them didn’t speak English. Wojtek was their ambassador among the locals. He used to go to dances with them and go on school visits, charming and disarming the locals and letting children ride on his back. He made a lasting impression on all who came in contact with him. To this day in Scotland, where the soldiers were stationed, there are plaques with his name appearing on the trees which he used to climb. In 1947 the soldiers got demobilised. They had to leave the barracks. They scattered around the UK, the US and Canada. Some went back to Poland. Wojtek couldn’t be accommodated in private dwellings. After some painful soul searching he was sent to the Edinburgh zoo. Someone said that, just like the Polish soldiers, “he won the war and lost his freedom”. He died at the age of 22, which is not bad for a Syrian bear. He had a swimming pool at the zoo and visits from his former army mates. They used to jump across the barriers and have boxing fights with him to the delight of the visiting public. The Zoo keepers looked the other way :) Edinburgh Zoo was the most progressive Zoo of the time. It was run by an animal welfare enthusiast who had left his well paying job as a lawyer in order to become the director of the zoo. Wojtek was forgotten both in Poland and in Scotland for many years. However, one of the little Scottish girls who met him in real life all those years ago has made it her mission to keep his memory alive and, when she grew up, pestered in both countries for recognition for him. Thanks to her a monument to Wojtek was put up in Edinburgh a few years ago, so he is famous there again. The people who met him would argue that he was more of a human in a bear’s body than an animal."},{"prompt":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","completion":"As someone who's read The fault in our stars and watched the Hollywood version,I still tried to watch Dil Bechara with zero expectations,and was genuinely impressed. Dil Bechara's cast takes the entire film on their shoulders and they do a splendid job. Late Sushanth Singh Rajput manages to light up the screen with his joyful performance and is the type of character who you'll keep rooting for no matter how bad things get. Sanjana on the other hand brings a lot of depth into the already emotional script and gives a performance that'll make you wanting for more. What works for Dil Bechara is that the essence of the book/film is not lost. The romance is built up in such a way that is both convincing and cute, and you really manage to connect with the characters. The Paris episode was short but the whole city was captured well. I don't know whether it was for Sushanth or because the emotion would have worked more,but the film could have been a tad bit longer. While the funeral rehearsal scene does make us shed a tear,had there been a little more build up till there,things would have worked out on another level. Yet,the performances of the leads and the supporting cast,music by AR Rahman,the romance and the locations make Dil Bechara a must watch. It's really tough for a remake to match the level of the original,but this movie has everything that Bollywood has been missing for quite some time. Give it a watch and you'll end up with a tear on your cheek and a smile on your face."},{"prompt":"eard lot of gurus say go deep or go inside. Where should I go? What is go inside?","completion":"Our five external sense organs are for looking, feeling, hearing smelling and tasting what is outside. Throughout our life, we learn how to use these five sense organs to learn about the world we live in and a little bit of ourselves. That is, we learn how we are to react with the outside. But that is not the entirety of us. Most of ourselves is inside us. Ordinarily, no one teaches us that we can learn about our true reality by looking within. This is your question. How to look within and what for? Fortunately, these questions can be partly answered in a logical way. Looking within does not mean we have to somehow turn our eyes inward and start looking at our internal organs, although that is possible to do when we have spiritual vision. But we are not born with spiritual vision, and very few among us have such vision. Looking within is a search for our indwelling spirit, the Atman.The Atman is the real us. Ramana Maharshi talked about this in a very matter of fact manner. He said, our hands and feet are not us, we have hands and feet. So, lets seek the answer or “who am I”? That is, if I am not this body, then who am I? Ramana Maharshi said, just watch for any clues forthe real I inside the body. Suppose I spoke a sentence, any sentence describing something I did. Lets search where is the I who spoke? How do we do that search? Sometimes, it is done by retracing the sentence back. If my sentence is, I am a man. I would go Man a am I. Where does that I land? When I try this, I always lands in my heart region. I think it is probably where it should be, because Shri Krishna says in rhe Bhagavad-Gita ईश्वर: सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति | 18.61 O Arjuna, the Lord situates Himself in the heart region of all beings. However, I do not have any spiritual experience. But others have. If hou like, you could download this book.

The junction between the pons and medulla would be a good choice. Your chance of hitting that spot is essentially nil, but for argument’s sake, let’s pretend you have better than x-ray vision and are a good enough shot to knock the eyelashes off a gnat at a hundred yards. Next you need an adequate caliber (your question) and a bullet construction that will tend not to deviate when it hits bone, or break up, and of course it has to be powerful enough to penetrate despite those bones being in the way. That leave out the little rimfires and 25 ACP. Pretty well any centerfire rifle cartridge will do, and handgun cartridges from the 32’s up will probably be OK if you choose the bullet in it very carefully and are perfect with your shot placement. Or you can do like most of us do, shoot center mass with something reasonably adequate for defense, and worry more about stopping the threat rather than killing instantly."},{"prompt":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","completion":"If you are capable of doing it yourself, why would you hire a contractor?

Whatever happened to keeping the enemy in the dark of your plans? Is it just politics, hubris or stupidity?","completion":"Biden has been fighting a different war than expected, since the beginning. Normally, if you get intel on the enemy’s plans, you keep it a secret. You don’t want them to know you know, you don’t want them to be able to figure out how you know, you may even act in ways you know are not optimal in order to preserve the idea that you don’t know. It’s how wars, hot and cold, have long been fought. Putin is fighting a different war too. He’s been lying, lying hard, spreading disinformation behind the scenes, getting his enemies to fight between themselves, and sewing internal divisions between each nation’s own populations. He also embraces the “big lie” where people say “no way he’d say that if it wasn’t true.” Biden’s radical strategy in the face of that has been… the truth. He (and the rest of the west) has been releasing classified intel that gives the lie to things Putin says, so that when Putin launched his attack, nobody believed his stated reasons. And the thing with the truth strategy is, when something happens, all the data coming out from it confirms what you’ve said, reinforcing the notion that the other things you’ve said are likely true as well. Putin’s statements are less and less credible. Biden’s statements are more and more credible. Morale among Russian forces continues to plummet, moral among Ukrainians, and in the Western nations, has been soaring, and the neutral countries? Aren’t so neutral. Only a handful of the most authoritarian countries, something like five out of 195 nations, give even nominal support to Russia, while most… are in line with the sanctions regime, are sending arms and supplies to Ukrainian forces, have made Russia a pariah state. Too, telling people what you’re sending, being truthful about it, means that the morale of the Ukrainian forces, who are nominally outgunned and outmanned by an (on paper) superior force, is strengthened still more. While Putin, whose lies about his own countries actual fighting capabilities are being revealed at long last, sees his own forces deserting in droves, abandoning their perfectly functional equipment or even handing it over to Ukrainians, who now have MORE tanks than they did when the war started. And that too isn’t a secret. Which snowballs, driving Ukrainian morale up further, and the support of the world (who loves a winner, particularly an underdog) higher, and the moral of the Russian forces still lower, so even MORE of them flee or surrender. Russian troops expected a cakewalk, with their superior numbers and superior technology and superior equipment. Instead they’ve had a nasty dirty slog, and are failing on every front, in part because their enemy is getting resupply, while they are not, and getting higher tech gear, while their own high tech gear turns out to again be a paper tiger, with such things as “hypersonic” missiles that are really 1970’s era short range ballistic missiles refit to mount on an aircraft and given a white paint job (yep, more intel that’s been released instead of kept secret.) The Moskva was sunk by a strategm nobody expected, using a cheap primitive drone to keep her equally primitive 180 degree radar pointed away from incoming cruise missiles so her defenses were not engaged. Biden and the West could have kept that secret in the hopes it would work again… but the thing is, it’s unlikely it WOULD work again, it was a “hail Mary” play the first time, and once you know how it’s done, it’s easier to defend against. And Putin’s forces could probably figure out how it was done, piecing together internal communications from before the hit, using their own vast intel network to ferret out information that’s supposed to be secret, interviewing the few survivors. They would keep the fact that they knew secret, but it wouldn’t work again. Instead, now, their entire fleet is rendered useless, because they are keeping it out of cruise missile range, and if they DO come in close, they can be frightened away with a simple cheap drone. Because it’s public knowledge. Are secrets being kept by the Biden and other Western nations? Of course. Nobody knows the plans in advance. Russian forces are kept guessing. But Russian troop movements, Russian atrocities, Russian supply problems… what we know about them, are being shared. Things Russia would like to keep secret, things they would not like the world to know, things they would not like their own forces to know… plastered all over, and because of the Truth strategy, believed. The latest news, Google Maps, which normally blurs over any photographs of military and other secret installations, has stopped doing that for Russia. Anyone in the Ukraine can now see exactly what preparations are being made, can see when supply columns depart, can see, frankly, how crappy the forces behind those paper tigers are. And anyone in the world who is thinking “maybe it’s time we strike Russia on her own soil” can see where and how those forces are arrayed, which in turn keeps them pinned down. Russia, desperate for replacement manpower and equipment in their war in Ukraine, can’t just pull forces out of other defenses, leaving them empty in secret… because it’s no secret. The Truth helps keep them stretched thin. It’s a crazy strategy. But it seems the perfect counter to Putin’s own mad lies and bluster strategy which he’s pulled out of the pages of Nazi Germany. It turns out, the truth hurts."},{"prompt":"w many German soldiers took their own lives versus being captured at the end of the Battle of Stalingrad?","completion":"Ermmm, three."},{"prompt":"What is the best LMS for online learning?","completion":"The need for alternatives to traditional education courses has led to the growing popularity of online courses.

Longer story… Following the end of the Blair/Brown years there needed to be a serious rebuilding and realignment of the Labour Party. The justifications for the Iraq war, the financial crisis etc etc left the electorate with a serious distrust of the Labour Party as it was. Not saying that this was the fault of the Labour Party in the case of the financial crisis but the Campbell/Blair push for Iraq certainly was (before you say anything, I am aware that the Conservative party were just as keen but the WMD lies were the problem). So you were left with a party that firstly needed to heal it’s image and then needed to strengthen a position that appealed to the voting public. In my opinion they failed - epically, Ed Milliband firstly, not even sure what to say about him, he was routinely taken apart by Cameron in debates and had about as much personality as a corpse. Then came the Momentum based madness of Corbyn and his bunch of clowns, completely out of touch with their core voters due to the infiltration of virtue signalling, middle class, echo chamber dwelling millennials. Hence the complete obliteration of the Labour heartlands. I have said it before and will say it again - there is one defining moment that created this (and also the whole Brexit mess we are in) - choosing Ed Milliband over David, who would have at least been a match for, if not better than David Cameron and would have been able to restore faith in the Labour Party."},{"prompt":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","completion":"It might not have been the biggest tip on the planet in terms of monetary value, but I had just gotten my favorite sandwich from Thundercloud Subs in Austin.

Мои заслуги известны эмиру. Когда хивинский хан пошел войной на Бухару, то эмиру, средоточию вселенной и тени аллаха на земле, благоугодно было поручить мне главенство над бухарским войском. И я распорядился так, что мы без кровопролития победоносно отразили врага и все дело окончилось к нашему благу. А именно: от самой границы хивинской и вглубь нашей страны на многие дни перехода все города и селения были, по моему приказанию, превращены в развалины, посевы и сады истреблены, дороги и мосты разрушены. И когда хивинцы вступили на нашу землю и увидели одну пустыню без садов и без жизни, они сказали себе: \\"Не пойдем в Бухару, ибо там нечего есть и нечем поживиться\\". Они повернули обратно и ушли, осмеянные и поруганные! И наш владыка эмир признать тогда соизволил, что разорение страны своим же войском есть дело столь мудрое и полезное, что распорядился ничего не исправлять и оставить города, селения, поля и дороги в том же разрушенном виде, дабы и впредь чужеземные племена не дерзали вступать на нашу землю.” “May Allah protect our Sun-like Lord from misfortunes, from illnesses and sorrows! My merits are known to the Emir. When the Khiva's Khan went to war in Bukhara, then the Emir, the center of the Universe and the Shadow of Allah on Earth, was pleased to entrust me with the primacy over the Bukhara army. And I ordered that without bloodshed we triumphantly repulse the enemy and the whole thing ended to our benefits. Namely: from the very border of Khiva and deep into our country for many days of transition, all cities and villages were, at my order, turned into ruins, crops and gardens were destroyed, roads and bridges were destroyed. And when the Khivans entered our land and saw one desert without gardens and without life, they said to themselves: \\"We will not go to Bukhara, because there is nothing to eat and nothing to profit from.\\" They turned back and left, ridiculed and scolded! And our Lord, the Emir, deigned to admit then that the ruin of the country by his own army was such a wise and useful thing that he ordered that nothing be corrected and that cities, villages, fields, and roads were left destroyed, so that henceforth foreign tribes would not dare to enter our land.” Now, have a look: This is a photo of a German car on Russia’s road in November 1941.

In addition, there you can meet like-minded people and get to know the restaurant kitchen better from the inside. You can visit culinary master classes at the studio [LINKED_TEXT: https://culinary-nyc.com/] [URL: https://culinary-nyc.com/]. The peculiarities of culinary master classes include a breakdown by cuisines of different countries and peoples, as well as a deep immersion in the cultural environment. If at other master classes only a field of activity is singled out (for example, sewing), then in cooking they go further and single out a specific cuisine (say, Italian), to which the entire master class is dedicated. At the same time, guests will be able to get in close contact with the peculiarities of the work of restaurants and professional chefs, as well as with the culture of the country or people whose cuisine is presented at the master class. The beginning of any master class begins with the introduction of the chef of his team, after which he tells what plan the event will take place. After that, the guests try the presented treats, which belong to a certain cuisine, which will be discussed at the upcoming master class. Then the master class takes place directly, the duration of which is 3-4 hours. Each participant has the opportunity to personally participate in the process of creating a culinary masterpiece, as well as watch how the chef works. Cooking master classes provide an opportunity to get a quick practical result. Simple cooking classes take a little longer, and students have to go through long programs learning the basics. At master classes, you can quickly learn how to create several dishes through personal participation in cooking and the help of professionals. It remains to practice a little at home, and you can impress guests. Culinary master classes are mainly held by the best chefs. Of course, experienced craftsmen share their knowledge in another area, however, such events are organized by restaurants, and they are held by the chefs of this institution. But they are the most talented culinary specialists who studied in European countries and have extensive work experience. Therefore, the master class provides an opportunity to meet and learn from real culinary stars, which is not only useful, but also very interesting. Given all of the above, it should be noted that cooking master classes are of interest not only to the fairer sex, but also to men who want to surprise their loved ones or are simply fond of cooking. In addition, master classes for children are also open, which, thanks to a fun and relaxed atmosphere, will help the children get a lot of impressions."},{"prompt":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","completion":"If you can go for months or years without seeing each other and pick up right where you left off.

Links that come from vital significant and high authority websites also provide increased brand awareness, referral traffic, and will directly affect the deceivability of a site. Search engines, especially Google, consider the quality and quantity of inbound links a measure of the value of your website. Google takes into account the value of links pointing to a page or website. High-value links can make your site move up the list in search results. There are different [LINKED_TEXT: types of backlinks] [URL: https://nikulsan.com/seo/how-many-types-of-backlinks-are-there-in-seo/]. In this post, I will be explaining about Nofollow and Dofollow. Let's start with understanding the difference between Dofollow and Nofollow links and how can you make both types of links work in your site’s favor. NofollowBacklinks Nofollow backlinks are beneficial for SEO. Nofollow links don’t permit search engine bots to follow your links. They’re used to inform search engines to ignore a particular link. That means if the website owner is linking back to you with Nofollow attributes, it does not pass on link juice. Example: <a href=”[LINKED_TEXT: http://www.google.com/”] [URL: http://www.google.com/%E2%80%9D] rel=”nofollow”>Google</a> Types Of No-Follow Robots Meta Tag : <meta name=”robots” content=”nofollow” /> This tells search engine bots/crawlers not to follow links on the full page. Link Attribute : <a href=”[LINKED_TEXT: http://www.google.com”] [URL: http://www.google.xn--com-9o0a/] rel=”nofollow”> This tells search engines not to count the link in terms of ranking pages. Although no follow links may not directly increase your website’s PageRank, they can still contribute value in several ways. Google’s Penguin update recognized that it was suspicious for a website to have all do follow links. So, it’s natural for a website to have a mix of no follow and do follow links. Nofollow links can bring traffic and increase brand exposure. Dofollow Backlinks Do-follow backlinks are the most frequent and [LINKED_TEXT: valuable type of backlink] [URL: https://nikulsan.com/seo/how-google-evaluates-links-for-seo/] for SEO. Dofollow is to reduce the search engine spam indexing and to improve the search engine results. Dofollow links are an HTML attribute that is used to allow search engine bots to follow the links. If a webmaster is linking to your site with a dofollow link, search engine bots and other people will follow you. Example: <a href=”[LINKED_TEXT: http://www.google.com/”] [URL: http://www.google.com/%E2%80%9D]>Google</a> Note: By default all the hyperlinks are dofollow. So, you don’t need to do anything to make a link do-follow."},{"prompt":"NIFT Patna good?","completion":"More than Good"},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"“Your hands are so cold like ice,” she said. “Oh, beware then, the warmth of your smile might melt them,” he said grinning. “What did you bring for me?” she asked bubbling with excitement.

The residents would often go out to the highway where they thought there was a bus stop. They wanted to visit someone somewhere. Of course, there was no bus stop. The facility built a fake bus stop out at the highway. When a resident wandered out there, a crew member was notified and would go out and sit with them in this phony bus stop and talk to them. They would tell them the bus had stopped running until the next day. The patient usually forgot why they were at the bus stop and just wanted to talk about something. Then they’d coax the resident back to the facility and safety.

In the continuous improvement of entrepreneurial innovation in recent years, the influence of Chinese startups in the world has gradually increased. Business giants always have a steady stream of topics, one is Amazon, the originator of e-commerce, and the other is Alibaba, which follows closely behind. How big is the gap between the two? Image source: Tuworm Creative Two major e-commerce giants, Amazon and Alibaba, are competing for the crown of global e-commerce market leaders. Both companies have established strong brand images in their respective home markets. Currently, the two technology giants are looking for new markets to expand competition. Amazon and Alibaba have a lot in common. Amazon's revenue mainly comes from the sale of electronic products, commodities, and digital media content (including Amazon Prime). Alibaba operates multiple e-commerce websites targeting different types of sellers. Taobao is one of Alibaba's most profitable platforms, generating more than 80% of Alibaba's sales. The business difference between Alibaba and Amazon. Amazon uses a self-employed method to control everything. All procedures for buying and selling need to go through their hands. They have their own product warehouses and sell their own products, while Alibaba is a platform position. And did not participate in the sale, only small businesses and brand manufacturers provide a platform to contact consumers, belonging to an intermediary, the subsequent process is direct dialogue between buyers and sellers. Moreover, Amazon is also a direct sales model. After the establishment of Alibaba, Cainiao Logistics, although not the traditional logistics, is the integration of logistics resources, so the core essence of Alibaba is e-commerce. Amazon is proud of big data, which is very efficient and accurate. Data mining has a feature, that is, the older the data, the more valuable it is. Obviously, Amazon is still doing a good job in this regard. Another advantage of Alibaba over Amazon is the ability to record cash, items and personal information. This ability will portray data objects more clearly. Moreover, in recent years, Ali has also invested heavily in the Internet of Things, big data and logistics. The most powerful is the data on Alipay. The advantages of Alipay will be infinitely enlarged in the future. Let's talk about the issue of fakes on the two platforms. Many consumers say that Taobao is a collection point for fakes. In fact, there are fakes on Amazon, saying that Amazon does not have fakes. In fact, I didn't spend a penny to buy something on the Amazon platform. Ma Yun also said that fakes have existed since the day humans were born. The current global commercial society has nothing to do with him. Of course, there are many excellent platforms: Wish, FashionTIY, Shopee, Lazada, Shopify, etc."},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"In today's digital age, making money online has become an attractive venture, and one of the most promising methods is affiliate marketing.

How did we become friends?', she would always ask, but neigther did I know the answer to that question, nor did she. I knew I was quite adventurous and crazy, but it was only after I met her, I understood I was in level 1 and she was in level 10 on a wholly different league. Her heart knew no fear, nor did her mind know any concern. She was daring, bold and crazy to the core. She stepped up my game and broke all the glass walls I restricted myself with. I started to see a whole new side of me, and in the middle of all of it, there she was effortlessly building my inner confidence. My fear was still there, but she carried it on her shoulders for me and showed me the wonder side of the world and bore all my pain. It was when I fell sick or would skip a meal, I saw a wholly different her, caring for my pain. People started calling her my mother, that's how caring she could get. She liked pain, she would feel it from the bottom of her heart and treat it as a part of the meal. She had that inner zeal, she could bear anything. But, behind a cold bottle of shots, her tears always take a peak. Suddenly life happens, and we are thrown worlds apart. Regular conversation is turning into a mirage and our busy lives never let us speak in peace. I knew she has a lot more souls to heal, like she did mine.

Wouldn't that be more effective than having an open bunker on top of a hill?","completion":"You could, as others mention this has been done. In fact, WWII Germany built a self-propelled gun that was basically a tank that could remove its own turret! It could drive up to a position, hoist its own turret up, then set it down on top of the position. [LINKED_TEXT: Heuschrecke 10 - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuschrecke_10] But honestly, this is kind of overkill because now you need to build a more complicated vehicle. And complication is a bad thing. You’d be better off digging a berm, then parking the tank behind the berm. Then, when you have to leave, you can take your turret with you! That’s a big part of modern MBT doctrine. Tanks look for positions behind ridgelines and berms, park there to cover their turret from potential enemy fire, and have the TC look for enemies. When he spots some, the tank pulls up to a hull-down position, the gunner fires at the enemy, the tank pulls back down, and the procedure is repeated as needed. When the position becomes untenable, the whole tank just leaves and can fight again another day. You can’t do that with bunkers."},{"prompt":"w do I combine Word documents into a PDF?","completion":"I will share with you most easy and time saving method for conversion of docs to pdf without using any website and App. You can easily convert your docs to pdf using WhatsApp🤔 .But how ?

In a court of law, no defendant can be perceived as a “prefered citizen”. We are all equal under the law, and must be treated equally to the greatest extent possible. That means that a defendant who is a physician will be refered to as Mr, or Ms instead of Dr and a defendant who is a judge themselves will be refered to as Mr or Ms instead of Your Honor, and a former President will me refered to as Mr or Ms instead of Mr or Ms President. Mr Trump can rightfully called President Trump socially or in a political setting, but not as correctly as Mr President in a legal setting where he is a defendant.

My understanding is less personal but maybe more objective or wide reaching. Elementary and middle school students have similar lives as Canadian children. They seem to have a similar mix of scholastics and sports and culture, but the way Koreans go at such things is more formal. After school, the parents of many students are at work so the kids go to sports clubs, cramming schools, music or other culture rather than home and then to such activities. At high school, this all changes and the children give up their childhood or have it taken from them. Here is a saying that describes your chances of getting into one of the best universities: Three and in, Four and out. If you get only three hours of sleep per night, you will get into a SKY (Seoul U, Koryo U or Yeonsei U) university. If you are lazy and sleep four or more hours instead of studying, you will not get into a good school. So high school students do little more than study. Their schools are segregated, male and female and they do not waste time interacting with the other sex. Then comes the University Entrance Exam. Students do nothing but study for it, and if they do poorly, a shocking number commit suicide. And after all that effort to get into university, with a big chunk of their futures already decided, they relax a little. Or a lot. As a university instructor I saw first year students that were in classes with peers of the opposite sex for the first time in years. The sort of teasing and shy/nervous actions of 14 year-olds in Canada are common in my university students. But there is one more big change coming. The male students in first year are as flighty and fun as the females. But then the males do their military service and when they come back, they are more serious and settled. They are better at doing homework and focusing. Strange how that second grim period of responsibility force upon them changes them."},{"prompt":"When I bring other people into my therapy sessions, I want my therapist to act as a mediator between me and them, but why is it that that never happens?","completion":"She is there to deal with you!

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","completion":"Some generators run on natural gas because some homes have natural gas service, natural gas is much cheaper than propane, natural gas never runs out (assuming you live in one of the 48 states with NG service that care about reliability - HI has no NG. TX has no modern reliability standards), and it doesn’t take up space (or view scape) in your yard like a propane tank does. Yes, there is a chance that the natural gas distribution network will fail, but it is a VERY small chance.

Here is a look at some very special features of IR’s innovations: Using Solar Energy: Taking a cue from the innovations in Airports where two Indian Airports - Cochin and Vadodara, today run solely on solar energy, the IR decided to do its bidding for environment. In doing so, IR is on its way to setting up solar roofs on stations where ever possible. It is a decade long program which will enable IR to save lots on energy costs.

If you had a child, how would you comfort him or her when he cries, gets hurt, has a need, physical or emotional? That. That is how you learn to respond to your own needs through reparenting yourself. When you are hurting, how to comfort that child within yourself so he or she feels loved and whole again and can dry their tears and smile? What if that child is being lazy or self destructive? How do you lovingly discipline and encourage? You do not berate the child or beat him, do you? No. You remove an indulgence, and acknowledge your disappointment and set an expectation and try again. When the child does something good, how do you praise him or her? You commend the positive traits. You celebrate the hard work or thoughtful behavior. You hug and acknowledge the child. You do not minimize, downplay, or ignore. You reward. From this question, I believe the angry child is communicating needs, too. He or she believes it is unfair to have this giant responsibility thrust upon him and is rightfully upset that this task is plopped in his lap. The adult you will have to intervene and love this angry child, too. However, the adult you should do that by acknowledging the anger as valid, but with the adult understanding that parents are not perfect. It’s true—they couldn’t be there for you as a child. However, you can choose to release them from the childlike expectation you had. You can also stop expecting perfection from yourself. You can move on and make an effort to work on yourself despite your upbringing. This is just part of being a whole adult. This is reparenting and it is 0% magical. It is something quite intentional.

Here are some tips to help you make a good impression and have a successful first date: Plan ahead: Choose a date activity or location that allows for conversation and getting to know each other. Consider activities like grabbing a coffee, going for a walk in a park, or having dinner at a quiet restaurant.Dress appropriately: Dress in a way that makes you feel confident and comfortable, while also considering the venue and occasion. Dressing well shows that you made an effort and can leave a positive impression.Be punctual: Arriving on time shows respect for your date and their time. If unforeseen circumstances arise and you will be late, make sure to inform your date as soon as possible.Be yourself: Authenticity is key. Be genuine and let your true personality shine. Pretending to be someone you're not is not a sustainable strategy for a successful relationship.Engage in active listening: Show interest in your date by actively listening to what they have to say. Ask open-ended questions that encourage conversation and allow you to learn more about each other.Keep the conversation balanced: Share information about yourself, but also give your date an opportunity to talk about themselves. Avoid dominating the conversation or focusing solely on yourself.Be positive and respectful: Maintain a positive attitude and be respectful towards your date. Avoid controversial topics or negative conversations, especially on a first date.Avoid distractions: Put away your phone or any other distractions during the date. Show your date that you are fully present and interested in getting to know them.Have realistic expectations: Don't put too much pressure on the first date. It's an opportunity to see if there is a connection and to enjoy each other's company. Keep in mind that not all first dates lead to a long-term relationship, and that's okay.Follow-up: If you had a good time and would like to see your date again, let them know. Send a text or call to express your interest in meeting up again. If you didn't feel a connection, it's still polite to thank your date for their time and wish them well. Remember that every individual and every date is unique. Be yourself, relax, and enjoy the experience.

Forests are no longer spiritual safe havens. In earlier Yugas, it was recommended to stay in a forest to make faster spiritual growth. Forest is a place filled with goodness compared to a city where people are very passionate. Also, you can live with sadhus who will guide/help you in the spiritual journey. It is always good to find a forest and meditate. And there would be so many good places still untouched by materialism. However, nowadays the forests and hills are filled with tourist camps and most people visit these places for materialistic activities. Thus there is not much respite you can find there. And the sadhus are also not to be seen as in the older ages. Srila Prabhupada realized that such forests are no longer great destinations for spiritual growth. Hence he constructed temples and created ashrams around it where a sincere seeker can stay away from society. Staying in the association with sadhus will help you to progress faster in your spiritual life. ISKCON temples are constructed with these purposes. You can visit ISKCON temple nearby and talk to the guides there."},{"prompt":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","completion":"Managing blood sugar levels is important for overall health, especially for individuals with conditions like diabetes or prediabetes.

It's a really difficult flavor to describe, but to me it has a much more “airy” taste than chicken (I didn't actually mean that as a pun). It's texture us not particularly gummy, like chicken can sometimes be (and like alligator always is.) It's certainly not a very strong flavor either, but it's not tasteless. Most Duck Sauces are sweet sauces or sweet and tangy sauces, because the sweet flavor compliments the duck in a way where one could nearly forget they were eating a meat product at all, and if they closed their eyes they could possibly think they were eating a strange textured dessert."},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

Ancient foreign history has given us clear answer only when Philip II and Alexander the great, his son, had them under there wings most of the Small City States today known as Greece as part of the Macedonian Empire. Otherwise the small ancient Cities States today known as Greece were inordinately proud of their status as independent small cities states. Often formed alliances with each other from time to time. Majority of the Cities states were taken over by Philip II the father of Alexander the Grate year 338 BC Philips professional and devoted fully Macedonian army was able to defeat the small states defended by Missionaries solders. Philip was Diplomatic using variety of tactics to succeed as well as destroying number of cities, when succeeded he made himself as a Commando chief in the region.

Greeknes is new concept invented in 19 century in Germanic states of Prussia and Bavaria by socalled Neo-Hellenists when Germanic people searched for their national identity and the Neo-Hellenists was we’ll alive iIn them… By comparison KINGDOM OF MAKEDON was founded around 850 - 900 BC, name of Makedon or Makedonia was established not long after that , since in a short period of time Macedonia was known as Emathia, and exists as Makedonia even in 21 century . Since we know well that territory of present day Greece was under Macedonian dominance and some of ancient indeginous population was blood related to Macedonians and they had in a way Macedonian origin for example Dorians and Pelasgians, Also kings of Macedon strongly believe to marry higher level of Royalties from the occupied territories witch will serve initiate reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. The language spoken was OLD MACEDONIK and from one of dialects evolved naturally into MACEDONIAN KOINE it is not difficult to conclude the MACEDONIAN character of whole region. Even after creation of new state of Greece 1831 the influence of MACEDONIAN language was present heavily when modern Greek language (demotiki and katarevusa) was in stage of consolidation. The German historian Fallmerayer in 1830's in his book “ Land of Morea said: “ if it is Greek , it is SLAVIC origin “. He used modern term Slavic instead ancient name Other Issue today Greeks Don’t want the rest of the wold to know match about… After there establishment of stolen land as above and releasing majority of people using different languages Dictator Ioannis Metaxas (1936–1941) a Greek military officer and politician served as Prime Minister with his Neo-Hellenic style had indeed banned the use of other languages.

They are doing fine for decades now in the Greek parliament and one of their brunches, the party of radical left “SYRIZA” actually ruled the country just the previous decade and All supported by the Greek Orthodox church in lots of different ways. Metaxas also passed laws against religious minorities such as Jehovah’s Witnesses. They are now doing fine too while back until the 40s they could even be executed. Metaxas was particularly prejudiced against the Bulgarians whom he had faced as enemies in previous wars. He was a veteran general afterall and Greece had been against Bulgaria in the 2nd Balkan War, WWI and-as it happened they were on opposite sides in WWII. Hellenizam on Macedonians… One needs to know not only true historical facts but to learn what is Hellenizam , Hellenic or Greek, Greeknes and so on in order to prevent atack on Makedonizam from those Western historians and modern Greek Quorans who try to give the ancient Macedonian Empire socalled “ Hellenic “ character. Hellenizam is academic , theoretical and descriptive term invented on beginning to midd 19 century in Bavaria . The name Hellenizam was invented by Johan Gustav Droysen , a Bavarian scholar and included a stage of history related to development of ancient societies from Europe , West Asia and North Africa in the last three centuries before Christianity under “ influence of Hellenic world “ ¹ ( ¹ imaginative , abstract language constract). Going back early 1872 Greece first time recognised the territory of Macedonia as below even although still was under the Ottoman Empire. 1913 Braking up of Macedonia with Illegal Bucharest agreement 32% of the original Macedonia in time Joining Yugoslavian, 15.5 %to Bulgaria, 2% to Albania and about 50.5% to Greece.

In case of MAKEDONIA the name is present even today, while the other two names Trachian and Illyrian disappeared as a result of certain historical and political circumstances.

I found out that one reason that the Army made a switch to a different uniform was because of thermal properties. Some material worn by our troops can more easily be detected via thermal optics in certain types of uniforms than when the soldiers are in other uniforms. So the Army may have ditched the digital for any number of reasons and gone to a different uniform.

If this is hard to believe, then take a look at the image below showing a brief snapshot of the comparison of Cyber security Investments in the year 2018 vs 2019. Because of so many online threats and the heavy cyber security budgets, the demand for ethical hacking professionals continues to rise. However, this high requirement of skilled individuals & the evolution of the digital world has led to an imbalance causing a ethical hacking skills shortage. Interested in entering this field? Then, now is the perfect time to become a ethical hacking specialist as the total jobs and the average salary is projected to grow remarkably in the next few years. Becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) can be a smart career move and can be incredibly lucrative with average salaries of 90k. Recently, I had been exploring various platforms for online courses on Ethical hacking so that I can increase my knowledge. Udemy is arguably one of the most popular ones. However, I got to know of a relatively unknown platform named Eduonix where I found a [LINKED_TEXT: great course on ethical hacking] [URL: https://inr.deals/SIPJZ] which uses “project-based” learning approach. Taking such an approach is quite beneficial: You get to learn. You get to apply. You get to showcase projects on your resume. I believe that taking a course for the sake of it may not be the best. Many students take the course for getting a certificate of completion. A better approach would be to take courses so that you can attempt projects that you are eventually able to showcase on your resume. This way, you can create a great interview story. To summarize, aim for online courses that not only help you learn but also help you build your resume."},{"prompt":"w can two punch biopsies on a mastectomy scar line be so different?

In the seventh book of his Histories, Herodotus introduces Artemisia with the following words: Of the other lower [Persian] officers I shall make no mention, since no necessity is laid on me; but I must speak of a certain leader named Artemisia, whose participation in the attack upon Greece, notwithstanding that she was a woman, moves my special wonder (Gr. thōma “marvel, wonder, astonishment”). True to that, Herodotus discusses Artemisia more than any other Persian commander save Mardonius, despite her relatively small military force (five ships). That’s in accordance with the overall orientation and style of his work. Far from being a dry, technical historian, he dedicates plenty of material to extraordinary figures and their stories. Artemisia is apparently one of them. So what are her main qualities in the Histories? The first is andrēiē (“manliness, manly daring,” from anēr “man”). That’s bravery, of course, but the term also has deeper, gender-related connotations. If anything, the best known assessment of Artemisia in the Histories is the comment about her performance at the battle of Salamis that Herodotus puts in Xerxes’ mouth: “My men have become women, and women men.” The second is her prudence and consulting skills — Artemisia is one of Xerxes’ closest advisors and the carer of his children. Before the battle of Salamis, she argues wisely against a direct confrontation with the Greeks, who she says are superior to the servile Persians. Xerxes disregards her advice and pays for it. Her next advice, that the king should leave Greece, gets accepted. Overall, Herodotus’ Artemisia is a liminal figure — a masculine and wise woman, half Greek and half barbarian, leading a mixed force against Greece under the orders of a barbarian king. It has been argued that her portrait constitutes a living contradiction — she is a thing to behold and at the same time a menacing reversion of the traditional norms of male-dominated archaic Greece."},{"prompt":"What kind of messages have you received from people on Instagram?","completion":"Random hey!, Hi! , can we talk ?

If Turkey is more interested in fooling around in such serious matters, it cannot be a reliable NATO partner.","completion":"I agree with Thierry. Türkiye offers much more of a strategic position than Sweden and has been part of NATO for over 70 years. It would be not only stupid but catastrophic to just decide to let it go, especially considering the fact that most NATO countries are strategically positioned near Russia for ease of access in case of conflict. Not even to mention playing with the lives of over 80 million people. NATO would lose hell of a lot more advantages by getting rid of Türkiye than what they will gain by letting Sweden join. In fact, they don't even need Sweden, Finland alone will do just fine. They're the ones who border Russia, right? Their concerns aren't for stupid reasons, Sweden's supporting a terrorist group and the whole thi g about the Quran being burnt has angered the Turkish government and rightfully so. It's a disrespect to their nation and they’re not happy. Imagine if Türkiye said; No don't let Sweden join. They're just scared because of the recent conflict with Ukraine (fairly recent compared to PKK in Turkiye and Middle East), they don’t respect our problems. That would be a problem. But Sweden supporting a known terrorist group, which is within the borders of Türkiye by the way, is not a problem. So no, you absolutely should not try to kick Türkiye out of NATO just because a bunch of people think they’re not being reasonable. We should sit down and talk about how to work with each other and respect each others concerns, this is a problem we're all facing together against a common threat. Maybe Türkiye isn't responding as maturely as they could have and maybe Sweden is not being fair in their judgement of Turkiye's decisions but that doesn't mean they can't work together."},{"prompt":"the MIT Pune good for a B.Tech?","completion":"Is the difference in B.tech and BE ."},{"prompt":"What are some ways I can attach both large and small vertical cardboard tubes to flat horizontal platforms when constructing a homemade multilevel cat tree?","completion":"I would suggest that the platforms could be made from plywood and have screw hooks driven into the centres and strong elastic bands or bungy cords can be hooked onto one.

A fresh idea of growing herbs, cereals at home and also at affordable price. They provide cans of herbs. We just need to add water and grow the plants which are healthy and full of nutrition. They also provide a list of how to do this. Started their launch in USA and added so many unique products into it. You can see the site. I am very much impress with the idea. As we are moving towards organic farming to get disease free life. This is the best which we can do at our homes. Its a one time investment and will get fresh food for lifetime.

You can start brand new business in India and become market leader into this. 4.Provide cooking kit Do you know meal kits are becoming popular nowadays, you just need to share ingredients and recipes to the customers. The recipes should be unique and tasty. Sun Basket is the start up leading in this. Their meal kit plans are becoming more famous. 5.Desi but healthy fast food You know, this is one of the unique ideas which I did not find anyone implementing. So pay attention to it. There are numerous recipes on internet which can be made from our day to day nutritional food. Those are instant and healthy. So why not sell it under the banner of healthy fast food. 6.Farm to kitchen. common but do it uncommonly I saw many startups just focusing on selling fruits and vegetables from farm. But what about the idea of selling all grains and cereals from direct farm to customers. Happy Roots is doing the same. making people inclined towards organic farming and earning profit for themselves also and for farmers also. As I already told, market is always open for new startup idea, you can give your insight into it and start with yours. 7.Get your deal Start your own website which gives deal on food delivery.

Number of students join Higher Education or PSU using their GATE is score is about 10,000 (max). Here I can write only about ECE students. I do not know much about other tracks. There are few reasons I write about ECE students. 1. ECE students are generally having good track record in School 2. ECE students score good CGPA during Engineering 3. Most ECE students are clueless after Engineering. GATE is too theoretical and designed for \\"Process of Elimination\\". GATE ECE syllabus does not reflect the current Industry needs. So if the ECE students put all their efforts for GATE and if they could not able to crack GATE (1% result) then the preparation may not be useful to the Industry. The ECE students should take different approach towards GATE if they want to crack GATE and get into Industry. 1. Do not try to Memorize and Vomit 2. Do not solve the problems mechanically. 3. Try to understand the fundamentals 4. Solve the previous year problems from fundamentals 5. Try to write simple C programs to solve the problems 6. Never aim for GATE 7. Do not proceed next step without understanding the current. 8. Do self Assessment 9. Prepare as follows 1. Digital Circuits - 100% 2. Electronic Devices - 80% 3. Analog Electronics - 60% 4. Engineering Mathematics - 50% 5. Network, Signals, Systems - 40% 6. Control Systems - 30% 7. Communication - 30% 8. Electromagnetics - 25% But 100% effort in Digital Circuits will give good marks in GATE and good job opportunity in Industry.

Why don't I put it in the garage? I tried it once, when I had a newish car and the weather forecast was hideous. I got the car into the garage (just, with wing mirrors folded in); but I couldn't get out, until I climbed out of the boot/trunk. My house and garage were built in 1968. Cars in 1968 must have been much narrower than today's cars, as my garage door frame is 6′6″ wide. My current car is 6′10″ wide, and I'm not planning to try getting it in the garage! Local planning regulations prohibit turning the garage into living space, so it acts as a workshop/tumble dryer/big freezer/lawnmower/bicycle storage space. That's fairly common here. Why did I spend the extra money on a house with a garage? Well, land is at a premium in lots of areas. Having a garage means that you probably have a back garden which is the width of the house and the garage. The front garden is the length of the drive and the width of the house: room for a tree or two, and room to park cars off the road.

N95 masks sometimes make difficult to breathe. Children should not use N95 masks. These masks do not provide full security in coronavirus. You can feel difficult to breathe in N95 masks and full security is also not guaranteed. My strong recommendation is to use surgical masks as they are good enough to prevent 100% pollutants of coronavirus. They can easily prevent the transmission of this virus.

Also, do you miss a companionship when traveling?","completion":"I have travelled with friends, with family, with my life partner and toddler son and solo too. The experiences that I had in each case was varied - from highly enjoyable to frustrating. Initially I was a bit sceptical but once I started to travel solo there has been no looking back. The experiences - good, bad, ugly - have been enriching and at times life changing. Being only myself to be taken care of the complete energy and focus is on the place I am visiting. Below are the factors that has motivated to travel solo. Travelling with friends is no less than a picnic, a hullabaloo - for even the simplest thing or decision. One experiences less of the place or the culture and just enjoys the company. Its like being swayed away with the flow. The upside being that one never gets bored and the bond with friends strengthens. Travelling with family is again a different affair all together. Most of the time, energy and resources are spent taking care of the family members and deciding on their comforts and attending to their requests. One comes back from a trip with lot of family pics and few misunderstandings and few agreements. Then there is travelling with ones spouse and children. The scenario is almost same as travelling with family but the level of comfort, the destinations are decided by the spouse. The pictures on social media of a family vacation always looks cute but the background story is totally different. There is a lot of struggle, effort and commotion everyday and every moment. Travelling happens in between those struggles, efforts and commotions. Well, having said the above, I haven’t stopped travelling with friends, family or with my spouse and toddler. I have a strategy. Before any trip I discuss with them and present an itinerary (verbal or written) and a rough plan about what to expect from the trip and from me. I have been following this strategy for a while and it has been a win win situation for all.

Vijay Setupathy as a struggling big cop is astounding witness in a show like Farzi. Amol Palekar as Nanaji is fantastic and makes me realize that he should do more films and shows. If you decide to watch Farzi on Amazon Prime watch it for the brilliant execution and incredible performances by the actor. You gotta watch it to believe how good this new Raj and DK show is. Also, don’t miss out on the exciting Family Man references in show which makes Farzi and Family Man of the same universe."},{"prompt":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","completion":"14 from 1 no series is 3,2,1 while from 7 it is 1,2,3."},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"An operating system (OS) is a type of software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the application software, providing a platform for software to run on. The main functions of an operating system include: Managing computer hardware resources such as memory, CPU, and storage devices.Providing a user interface that allows users to interact with the computer.Managing software resources such as system libraries, device drivers, and application programming interfaces (APIs).Ensuring security and protection of the system and its resources.Managing processes and scheduling tasks, such as multitasking, time-sharing, and multiprocessing. Some popular examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens? ChatGPT While some Windows laptops and tablets come with touch screens, Apple has not added touch screen functionality to its Mac computers. There are several reasons for this decision: Macs are primarily designed for productivity and creative work, and a touch screen may not offer significant productivity benefits over using a mouse or trackpad. For tasks that require precision or fine control, a mouse or trackpad is often more efficient than a touch screen.Adding a touch screen would require major changes to the macOS operating system and user interface, which could introduce compatibility issues and require significant resources to develop and maintain.Apple has placed a greater emphasis on integrating touch and pen input with its iPad tablets, which are designed for more portable and tactile use cases.Finally, Apple has been focusing on developing alternative input technologies such as the Touch Bar on some Mac models, which offers context-specific shortcuts and controls, and the Force Touch trackpad, which offers pressure-sensitive input and haptic feedback. Overall, while touch screen functionality may offer some benefits for certain use cases, Apple has chosen to prioritize other input methods and design considerations in its Mac computers"},{"prompt":"anyone looking for a freight forwarder?","completion":"Job availability can vary depending on the location and the specific industry.

She outlines in her blog post the tips on how to score top marks in the Maths IA. Familiarise yourself with what the blog outlines, as no matter how good your title or topic is, if you fail to satisfy the basics of an IA, you will struggle to score highly on the assignment. That said, a topic I recently helped one of my students with, who went on to score a high mark, was the effect of literacy rate on unemployment in a given country. This is an example of a modelling-based IA, where we created 3 models. Model 1 was about creating a linear regression to show, at a very simple level, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables aforementionedModel 2 was about creating an inverse logarithmic function which could better fit the data and then use calculus to comment on the rate of change at different levels of literacy rateModel 3 was about using ‘dummy variables’ to argue that there is greater scope for boosting literacy rates in developing countries than developed countries if the ultimate aim is to decrease unemployment. The idea behind the IA, which made it great, was that the IA was aimed at allowing to draw real-life conclusions and insights which could be used by policymakers to justify why they are, for instance, boosting literacy rates in a country as a way to diminish unemployment. The student therefore was able to score high on personal engagement and critical thinking, along with the knowledge of maths.

As an expert in personal development and lifelong learning, I'm happy to offer some insights on this topic. One of the most amazing skills you can learn is the ability to learn. This might sound meta, but it's actually a crucial skill in today's rapidly changing world. By developing a growth mindset and honing your ability to learn new things quickly and effectively, you'll be able to adapt to any situation and thrive in any career. There are many ways to improve your learning skills, such as practicing active listening, taking notes, and breaking down complex ideas into manageable chunks. With these tools in your arsenal, you'll be able to learn anything you set your mind to. Another amazing skill to learn is creativity. While many people assume that creativity is an innate talent that some people are born with and others are not, the truth is that creativity can be developed and nurtured like any other skill. By cultivating your curiosity, expanding your knowledge, and experimenting with new ideas, you can unleash your inner creativity and find innovative solutions to problems. Whether you're an artist, a scientist, an entrepreneur, or just someone who wants to approach life with more imagination and innovation, learning to be creative is an invaluable skill that will serve you well throughout your life. I can still remember the day when I decided to start learning new skills on a regular basis. I had always been interested in personal development and self-improvement, but I had never really made it a priority in my life. Then, one day, I realized that if I wanted to achieve my goals and live the life I dreamed of, I needed to start taking action. So I made a list of skills I wanted to learn, and I started working on them one by one. I learned how to code, how to write compelling stories, how to play the guitar, and how to speak Spanish. Each time I learned a new skill, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride. And as I continued to learn and grow, I began to realize that the real value of learning new skills wasn't just in the skills themselves, but in the confidence, I gained from knowing that I could tackle any challenge that came my way. So if you're wondering what skills to learn next, I encourage you to make a list and start exploring new areas of interest. Who knows, you might just discover a hidden talent or passion that changes the course of your life for the better."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

A few, however, stand head and shoulders above the rest. Their powers are incalculable and far beyond comprehension. Here is our list of the most powerful characters in the entire Marvel comic book universe. 15. Vulcan Vulcan Emperor Vulcan (also known as Gabriel Summers, the brother of Scott Summers) is an omega level mutant who has the ability to manipulate all forms of energy, including magic, at will. Once the Emperor of the Shi’ar Empire, Vulcan has even fought against the X-men, Inhumans and Starjammers simultaneously. According to his creator, Ed Brubaker, Vulcan has control over seven elements (fire, earth, electricity, wind, water, darkness, and light). 14. Skaar Skaar The son of the Hulk in an alternate reality, Skaar possesses even greater strength than his father. With a single punch, he once cracked the armour of the Juggernaut and sent him into the outer atmosphere. He has also survived falls from outer space and has a healing factor superior to Wolverine. 13. Odin Odin Odin, the father of Thor and the strongest of all Asgardians, is an immortal that can manipulate magic for a variety of effects. He also has the ability to absorb the powers of all the Asgardians into himself to greatly augment his already formidable powers. 12. Hercules Hercules Over 3000 years old, Hercules, the son of Zeus, is considered the physically strongest character in the entire Marvel universe. He is stronger than both Thor and Hulk, and once pulled the entire island of Manhattan which weighed 99,000,000,000 tons. Aside from his great strength, Hercules is able to withstand cosmic blasts from Nova and is able to survive in space unaided. 11. Grandmaster Grandmaster The Grandmaster is an eternal, ancient being that cannot die, has supernatural physical characteristics and the ability to bring the dead back to life. He is also vastly intelligent and powerful. 10. Galactus Galactus Known as the Devourer of Worlds, Galactus eats entire planets and has unlimited cosmic power and knowledge. He also possesses technology that works with his biology and is perceived as the species of whoever is looking at him. For example, a human would see him in human form. 9. Magus Magus Not to be confused by his son, Adam Warlock, Magus’ power is comparable to that of Galactus. He can become virtually any substance, any size, shape and colour – enhanced shape-shifting. He is immortal and can also teleport, but his powers tend to fluctuate based on the form he takes. At his most powerful, he’s able to split a star in two. 8. Mikaboshi Mikaboshi Mikaboshi, the Japanese god of evil and chaos, is an abstract being greater than Odin. His powers include immortality, reality manipulation, stealth, strength, healing, endurance, shape-shifting, and more. 7. Cyttorak Cyttorak Cyttorak is a powerful deity and possibly the strongest magical being in all of the Marvel universe. He is often the source of the elite magicians of the universe, including Doctor Strange. He is omnipotent within his Crimson Cosmos. 6. Phoenix Force Phoenix Force Phoenix Force is a powerful cosmic entity and the prime universal force of life that takes on various hosts, most frequently Jean Grey, Rachel Grey, Emma Frost and even Professor X. It single-handedly defeated Galactus. It can absorb energy, including the life-force of a being or the energy of a sun. 5. Franklin Richards Franklin Richards One of the rare omega-level mutants, Franklin Richards, the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, has the ability to warp reality and control the fundamental forces of the universe. It is said that his power equals that of the Celestials. He first appeared in Fantastic Four Annual #6 (1968) and is quite possibly the strongest mutant to ever exist. 4. Eternity Eternity First appearing in Strange Tales #138, Eternity, the twin brother of Infinity and the sibling of Death and Oblivion, is the very embodiment of time. Greater than Galactus, he can manipulate space, time, and reality. 3. Living Tribunal Living Tribunal Created by Stan Lee, Marie Severin and Herb Trimpe, The Living Tribunal is so powerful that even Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet dares not to engage him in combat. His power is absolutely limitless and he is able to erase entire realities from existence. However, The Living Tribunal has died fighting Beyonder before. 2. Beyonder Beyonder A near omnipotent and vastly powerful entity, Beyonder first appeared in Secret Wars #1. He is so strong that all the Marvel abstracts, celestials, supreme cosmic beings, and The Living Tribunal are at his mercy. He is second only to One-Above-All. 1. One-Above-All One-Above-All One-Above-All, who first appeared in Doctor Strange #13, is the most powerful and the most mysterious character in the Marvel multiverse. He is believed to represent the creators of Marvel and has taken the form of Jack Kirby.
