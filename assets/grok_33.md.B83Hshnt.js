Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. How long has Temple Spa been a company?

Plot title: 4.3.2.1 Movie plot: The story focuses on four 19-year-old friends: Joanne, Cassandra, Shannon and Kerrys. They all meet one other at a diner, where they see Dillon and Smoothy. Unbeknownst to Dillon, Shannon has a crush on him. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home. First, the story focuses on Shannon: she walks into her home just as her mother is leaving her father. She loses her temper and runs away, going to Jo's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Jo calls Shannon over to the supermarket where she works, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, whom he asked out earlier in the day, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away. After getting drunk at a bar, she goes to a tunnel where she sprays graffiti on the wall, is attacked by a gang and then taken in by Kelly, who saved her. Shannon realizes that Kelly seems to be looking for the Pringles. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for \\"15 diamonds\\". One is already in Cassandra's bag and the rest are in the can that fell out of Shannon's bag in the tunnel. She escapes by knocking Kelly out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to where she was attacked, and leaves a message informing Jo about them. Later, Shannon tracks down her mother and accuses her of not caring about her, especially when she forced her to get an abortion. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to commit suicide. Jo, Cassandra and Kerrys appear to threaten Shannon into handing the diamonds over. Second, the story moves onto Cassandra, who visits New York City to meet up with Brett, whom she has met on the internet and audition for a piano school.

We have an equation: -635l + 297l - 2415 = -303l First, let's work with all the \\"l\\" terms on one side of the equation.

Heat plays an essential role in grape cultivation. However, excessive heat or high temperature can adversely impact the quality and quantity of the grapes. Step 2: Effects of high heat: High heat or temperature can cause grapevines to shut down and stop ripening the fruit. It can also lead to uneven ripening or shrivel the grapes, making them unusable. This reduces the overall yield of grapes that can be harvested for wine production. Step 3: Impact on the wine production process: With fewer quality grapes available, the wine production process will be directly affected. Under these circumstances, lesser wine can be produced.

Plot title: Beowulf Movie plot: Set in 507, Beowulf is a legendary Geatish warrior who travels to Denmark with his band of soldiers, including his best friend, Wiglaf. They meet King Hrothgar, who needs a hero to slay Grendel (Crispin Glover), a hideously disfigured troll-like creature with superhuman strength. Grendel attacks Heorot, Hrothgar's mead hall, whenever the Danes held a celebration, and Hrothgar has been forced to close the hall. Upon arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife, Queen Wealtheow, who reciprocates his interest. Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out. When the beast attacks, Beowulf engages him unarmed and naked. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which is why he interrupts Hrothgar's celebrations â the noise they make is physically painful to him. After his eardrums are ruptured by Beowulf, Grendel attempts to escape. Beowulf restrains Grendel and severs his arm with the door. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon Fafnir. In his cave, the dying Grendel tells his mother what was done to him, and she swears revenge. She travels to Heorot and slaughters Beowulf's men while they are sleeping. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf, who had been sleeping outside the hall during the attack, that it was the work of Grendel's mother. She is the last of the Water Demons, who were thought to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel to the demon's cave to slay her. Beowulf enters the cave alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful woman. She offers to make him the greatest king who ever lived, in exchange for a son to replace Grendel and Hrothgar's drinking horn. Beowulf agrees to the deal and returns, claiming to have killed her.

Alert: Gregory Lewis fled his 1,000 bail in September and is suspected of at least six more violent sexual assaults across the country since The nationwide manhunt for a child rape suspect has come to a dramatic end after he was arrested in Upstate New York Tuesday night after crashing his Jeep into the Hudson River following a police chase. Gregory Lewis, 26, spent more than a month on the run after cutting off his GPS minoring bracelet in Massachusetts and fleeing across the country. Now, police reveal, he vowed to murder the 13-year-old girl who first accused him of sexually assaulting her. Rampage over: Lewis' time on the lam ended Tuesday night 160 miles from where it began in","completion":"Southbridge, Massachusetts. He had managed to stay one step ahead of the police by committing a series of crimes and sexual assaults in multiple states, including North Carolina, Colorado, Oregon, and Indiana. Authorities had issued numerous warnings to the public about Lewis' violent tendencies and urged anyone with information on his whereabouts to come forward immediately. During his crime spree, Lewis had been meticulously documenting each of his vicious acts in a handwritten journal. Upon his arrest, investigators also discovered a \\"hit list\\" targeting police officers, prosecutors, and witnesses involved in his ongoing child rape case, with the young girl who first accused him of sexual assault at the top of the list. After his dramatic capture and subsequent arrest in upstate New York, Lewis was transported to a local hospital for treatment of minor injuries sustained during the car crash. He was later extradited back to Massachusetts, where he faced a slew of charges, including kidnapping, aggravated rape, assault with intent to murder, and multiple counts of fail to register as a sex offender. Local, state, and federal prosecutors began working together to build a solid case against Lewis, utilizing evidence from his journal, surveillance footage, and any information provided by the brave survivors who came forward to identify him as their assailant. During his trial, Lewis was described as a \\"monster\\" and a \\"sociopath\\" by the prosecution. Medical experts testified that Lewis was a prime example of a \\"sexual sadist,\\" finding pleasure in the physical and emotional pain of his victims. Defense attorneys argued for leniency, pointing to Lewis' troubled upbringing and mental health struggles as factors in his behavior. However, the jury was ultimately swayed by the overwhelming evidence against him and the harrowing testimonies of those who had been subjected to his brutal crimes. Lewis was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole. In the aftermath of Lewis' capture and conviction, communities across the country breathed a collective sigh of relief, knowing that a dangerous predator had been taken off the streets. The case also sparked a nationwide conversation about the importance of increased vigilance in monitoring sex offenders and the need for more comprehensive support systems for victims of sexual assault. In a final twist, the bravery of the 13-year-old girl who first accused Lewis of sexual assault inspired further victims to come forward and report their own experiences. This led to even more arrests, proving that, in the end, courage and justice prevailed over the sinister intentions of Gregory Lewis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer based on context: In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, bringing back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary was under Ottoman control. As part of a Franco-Ottoman alliance , French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543-1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army. In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of Székesfehérvár in September 1543. Other cities that were captured during this campaign are Siklós and Szeged in order to better protect Buda. However, continuous delay of the push toward the west, because of the siege of these fortresses, meant that the Ottomans could not launch any new offensive against Austria. From 1548 to the end of the war, a Habsburg Spanish infantry tercio which had fought in the Schmalkaldic War, led by Maestre de campo Bernardo de Aldana, was detached in Hungary to fight against John Zápolya's supporters on behalf of Ferdinand.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Frederic Leighton used as a model? , can you please find it? Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...

Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population. But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. What is an answer for this question: Which country had fewer resource for each individual? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, we can deduce that the country with fewer resources for each individual would be Spain, which had a larger population size compared to Italy. As stated, when the population size is small, like in Italy, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. This means that the smaller population in Italy results in more resources being available for each person. In contrast, Spain has a larger population, which would typically lead to a decrease in the availability of necessary resources, such as food, for each individual. As resources become scarcer due to increased demand from the growing population in Spain, the competition for these limited resources becomes more intense, leading to fewer resources being available for every person compared to Italy with its smaller population. This, in turn, can affect factors such as birth rates and overall population growth rates. In conclusion, Spain, with its larger population, had fewer resources for each individual when compared to Italy, which had a smaller population size and thus more resources available per person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important to note that while the second sentence might be factually true, we cannot claim it to be so based solely on the information provided in the original sentence. To make such a claim, we would require additional evidence or context to support the charitable aspect of the race.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the notname of the person who was based in Cologne and was once one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer? from the following article ? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Consider this sentence: Susan knows all about Ann 's personal problems because *she* is nosy. Are \\"she\\" and \\"Ann\\" the same?","completion":"In the sentence provided, \\"Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because *she* is nosy,\\" it is important to examine the context and the pronoun-antecedent agreement to determine if \\"she\\" and \\"Ann\\" are the same. Pronoun-antecedent agreement is a grammatical rule that dictates that a pronoun must agree in number and gender with the noun (or antecedent) it refers to. In this sentence, the pronouns \\"she\\" and \\"Ann\\" both represent female individuals. However, we must also consider the context of the sentence to determine if they are the same person. The sentence structure suggests that Susan possesses knowledge about Ann's personal problems, and this knowledge is gained because of a particular characteristic - being nosy. The pronoun \\"she\\" logically refers to the person who has knowledge of Ann's personal problems and is nosy in this context. Based on this understanding, it would seem that \\"she\\" is referring to Susan, not Ann. So, \\"she\\" and \\"Ann\\" are not the same in this sentence. Instead, \\"she\\" is referring to Susan, who is the one exhibiting nosy behavior by knowing about Ann's personal problems. It is important to pay attention to context when interpreting pronoun usage in sentences to accurately identify the intended meaning and pronoun-antecedent relationship. In this case, the context provided informs us that the nosy individual is Susan, not Ann, and therefore \\"she\\" refers to Susan."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest.

A Scholar Is Back Home and Defiant in Hungary Agnes Heller in Budapest, where she returned after years abroad. ââLiberalâ here is a dirtier word than âNaziâ or âcommunist,âââ she said in an interview. BUDAPEST â âDuring my years abroad, both in the U.S. and Australia, I always said that I liked living there, but that I want to be buried in my home, in Hungary,â said the philosopher Agnes Heller, who at the age of 84 lives in Budapest, still writing â in three languages â and lecturing. It is generous of Ms. Heller to preserve affection for a homeland that has been so unkind to her. She was born and raised in the cityâs Jewish ghetto in the volatile political climate of 1930s Central Europe. Ms. Heller and her mother narrowly escaped deportation to Auschwitz; her father perished there. In the postwar years she studied philosophy under the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs, and later became part of the so-called Budapest School around him â radical thinkers calling on Hegel and the humanist works of early Marx to reinvigorate contemporary Marxism. In the aftermath of the 1956 revolution in Hungary, Ms. Heller, though a socialist and Communist Party member, was imprisoned by the Soviet-backed hard-liners for promoting counterrevolutionary thinking and banned from working at a university. In 1977 she emigrated to Australia as a political exile. During the 1980s, Ms. Heller rethought her political views, becoming highly critical of orthodox Marxism. She subsequently assumed the Hannah Arendt visiting professorship of philosophy and political science at the New School for Social Research, in New York, where she lived and taught political theory for 25 years. But itâs more than sentimentality that compels Ms. Heller to stay in Hungary, where she is professor emeritus at Budapestâs esteemed Eotvos Lorand University. Her experience and knowledge are needed here, she says, particularly now. And peers, like the political scientist Andras Bozoki, professor at the Central European University, are grateful to have her: âSheâs a model of a freethinker and free citizen. Agnes Hellerâs a globally known scholar who believes it is the role of intellectuals to engage civically,â he said. In recent years, Ms. Heller has become a leading figure speaking out against the policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his party, Fidesz. Mr. Orban has been criticized by the European Union and human rights groups for limiting freedoms of expression, among other controversial political moves. In higher education, critics say, Mr. Orban has gradually stripped away universitiesâ independence. His administration, for example, has required that the government itself appoint university rectors. The atmosphere, many say, is one of fear and uncertainty. Pressure has been brought to bear on the countryâs liberal-minded intellectuals, those defiant enough to protest â among them Agnes Heller. In the international news media as well as the handful of independent outlets still in business in Hungary, Ms. Heller decries Hungaryâs authoritarian drift and underscores the responsibility of its scholars, as well as its ordinary citizens, to resist. The government says these charges are nonsense. âAgnes Heller is doing what she always does: complaining loudly abroad whenever thereâs an anti-communist government in power in Budapest,â said Andras Doncsev, deputy minister at the Ministry of Human Resources, which is responsible for education. Hungarian universities are world-renowned and enjoy full academic freedom, he added. Ms. Hellerâs words earned her the wrath of the Orban administration as early as 2011, when she and a handful of other academics were accused by a government commission of embezzling research funds earmarked for translations. In early 2012 the charges were dropped for lack of evidence. âThere was nothing to the charges at all,â said Anna Gacs, an associate professor of media studies at Eotvos Lorand University and a founder of the University Lecturersâ Network, a faculty group formed to protect the public universities from government interference. âIt was the regimeâs first attempt to control the critical intelligentsia.â Speaking with a reporter in her small apartment, high above the Danube River, Ms. Heller said the government âknew there was nothingâ in the charges. âBut this is their strategy,â she said. âThey make these kinds of accusations, spread them all over their loyal media outlets, and thus blacken the names of their opponents. By targeting liberals, they blacken the name of liberalism itself. âLiberalâ here is a dirtier word than âNaziâ or âcommunist.ââ Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Agnes Heller, an 84-year-old philosopher, has become a leading figure speaking out against the policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his party, Fidesz, despite facing backlash and false accusations.

Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Born and raised in Marshall, Texas, to Alma and Yelberton Abraham Tittle Sr., Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. aspired to be a quarterback from a young age. He spent hours in his backyard throwing a football through a tire swing, emulating his neighbor and boyhood idol, Sammy Baugh. Tittle played high school football at Marshall High School. In his senior year the team posted an undefeated record and reached the state finals. After a recruiting battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and play for the LSU Tigers. He was part of a successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible to play on the varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment of his four years at LSU was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season. Moore started Tittle at tailback in the single-wing formation his first year, but moved him to quarterback in the T formation during his sophomore season. As a junior in 1946, Tittle's three touchdown passes in a 41-27 rout of rival Tulane helped ensure LSU a spot in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Known notoriously as the \\"Ice Bowl\\", the 1947 Cotton Bowl pitted LSU against the Arkansas Razorbacks in sub-freezing temperatures on an ice-covered field in Dallas, Texas. LSU moved the ball much better than the Razorbacks, but neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0-0 tie. Tittle and Arkansas end Alton Baldwin shared the game's MVP award. Following the season, United Press International (UPI) placed Tittle on its All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) first-team. UPI again named Tittle its first-team All-SEC quarterback in 1947. In Tittle's day of iron man football, he played on both offense and defense. While on defense during a 20-18 loss to SEC champion Ole Miss in his senior season, Tittle's belt buckle was torn off as he intercepted a pass from Charlie Conerly and broke a tackle. He ran down the sideline with one arm cradling the ball and the other holding up his pants. At the Ole Miss 20-yard line, as he attempted to stiff-arm a defender, Tittle's pants fell and he tripped and fell onto his face. The fall kept him from scoring the game-winning touchdown. In total, during his college career Tittle set school passing records with 162 completions out of 330 attempts for 2,525 yards and 23 touchdowns. He scored seven touchdowns himself as a runner. His passing totals remained unbroken until Bert Jones surpassed them in the 1970s.","completion":"This text is about Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr., known as Y. A.

Mr Saleh said: \\"This lady screamed, 'what is he saying?' and said she felt uncomfortable. \\"The captain came and asked what happened. \\"I was so disgusted I took a video as I was being asked to leave,\\" he added. US airline Delta released a statement on its website saying \\"more than 20 customers\\" expressed their discomfort. It is unclear whether they were referring to the Arabic speaking, or the disturbance that followed. \\"We take all allegations of discrimination seriously and we are gathering all of the facts before jumping to any conclusion,\\" the statement said. It continued, \\"Maintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the co-operation of all of our customers.\\" Mr Saleh said he later boarded a different flight with a different company. \\"Once we were off the [Delta Airlines] plane, we were told it was because we were being loud.

Earlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax. Mr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims. Numerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because their race or assumptions about their religion. London pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \\"prayer on his phone\\" and reported him as a security threat. An Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April. Faizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight. Delta Airlines has in the past been accused of racism. In October, Tamika Cross, a black doctor, said her credentials were questioned when she tried to help a patient on an internal US flight.

Question: Why is the use of solar balloons typically limited to the toy market? Answer: A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Let me provide a more detailed answer for the question. Step 1: Understand the concept of solar balloons. A solar balloon is a balloon made out of a black or dark material that is filled with air. The dark color absorbs the sun's energy and heats up the air inside the balloon. As a result, the air expands, and the balloon rises due to the buoyant force. Step 2: Identify the potential applications of solar balloons. Solar balloons can be utilized for various purposes, such as observation, measurement, and even power generation if the heat energy absorbed is converted efficiently. They can also be used for recreational purposes, including as toys for children. Step 3: Analyze the limitations of solar balloons. There are various factors that limit the wider application of solar balloons, such as: a) The reliance on sunlight for their functioning, which makes their use dependent on weather and time of day. b) The relatively low lifting capacity compared to other lighter-than-air technologies, such as helium or hydrogen-filled balloons. c) The limited payload capacity, which may restrict the amount or type of equipment that can be attached to the balloon. Step 4: Form a conclusion based on the analysis. Considering the limitations mentioned in Step 3, it is evident that solar balloons are primarily constrained in their applications. Their dependence on sunlight, low lifting capacity, and limited payload capacity may not be suitable for various practical purposes, such as scientific research or long-duration flights. Therefore, the use of solar balloons is typically limited to the toy market, where these limitations do not negatively affect their recreational purpose."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael's face and smiles.Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse's mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son's body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.Six Years Later:Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt. Castor is a career terrorist, responsible for countless terrorist bombings, aircraft hijackings, and political assassinations, among other crimes.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Question: suppose the mains water is temporarily off happens, how will it affect more oxygen reaches the red blood cells. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the mains water is temporarily off, it is unlikely to directly affect the amount of oxygen reaching the red blood cells in the human body. The process of oxygen transport from the breath taken to the red blood cells and ultimately to the tissues and cells is primarily an internal mechanism that is not reliant on external factors like the availability of mains water. However, there are some indirect ways that a temporary lack of mains water could potentially affect oxygen delivery to red blood cells, which can be discussed as follows: 1. Dehydration: If the unavailability of mains water leads to a lack of water intake, it can cause dehydration. Dehydration affects the blood volume, making it more viscous. This increased blood viscosity may decrease the efficiency of oxygen exchange in the capillaries, potentially resulting in less oxygen reaching the red blood cells. 2. Reduced Cardiovascular Efficiency: In a state of dehydration, the heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout the body due to the reduced blood volume. This scenario may lead to decreased cardiovascular efficiency, which may indirectly affect the rate at which oxygen reaches the red blood cells. The alteration in cardiovascular efficiency might lead to a reduction in oxygen reaching the red blood cells. 3. Stress and Anxiety: If the unavailability of mains water causes stress and anxiety, it may lead to an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation). Hyperventilating could potentially cause an imbalance in the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body, which might affect the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of the red blood cells. In this case, the effect on oxygen reaching the red blood cells could vary - more, less, or no effect, depending on the severity and duration of the hyperventilation. 4. Reduced Physical Activity: A lack of available water could lead to individuals being less inclined to engage in physical activity due to concerns about dehydration. Decreased physical activity levels might have an indirect impact on oxygen demands and delivery to the red blood cells, possibly resulting in less or no effect. In conclusion, while the temporary unavailability of mains water does not directly impact the process of oxygen reaching the red blood cells, certain indirect consequences may arise due to dehydration, reduced cardiovascular efficiency, stress, and diminished physical activity. These indirect effects might lead to less oxygen reaching the red blood cells but would heavily depend on various factors such as individual health, adaptability, and the duration of water shortage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It might be suitable for a small child, if he didn't mistake it for a cracker. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the size of the book, mentioning that it was advertised as \\"Hardcover\\" but is only about 2\\" x 2\\" in size. Such a diminutive book might not meet the expectations of someone looking for a regular-sized hardcover edition, leading the reviewer to feel misled by the advertisement. Additionally, the reviewer states that the book might only be suitable for a small child, but even then, there is a concern that the child might mistake the book for a cracker, which further highlights the reviewer's disappointment in the product. The mention of a child potentially mistaking the book for food is most likely an exaggeration but serves to emphasize the perceived inadequacy of the book's size. Moreover, the language used in the review is sarcastic and mocking in tone, with phrases like \\"It's tiny\\" and \\"if he didn't mistake it for a cracker.\\" This indicates that the reviewer is not merely providing constructive criticism to inform potential buyers but also expressing their displeasure and frustration with the product. In conclusion, the product review conveys a negative sentiment. The dissatisfaction stems from the misleading advertisement and the book's size, which the reviewer believes to be unfit for its intended audience. The sarcastic tone and negative comparisons further emphasize the reviewer's disappointment and discontent with their purchase."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Dobro lessons Review: My oldest son is an excellent guitarist and wanted to learn the Dobro.

Please answer the following question: This article: Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step of the process involves the release of certain substances, known as pollutants, into the atmosphere. These pollutants, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are emitted during various human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle exhaust. Fossil fuel combustion, such as coal-fired power plants and other industrial facilities, releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the air. Additionally, automobile engines, manufacturing processes, and agricultural activities contribute to the emission of these pollutants. Natural sources, like volcanic eruptions and forest fires, can also release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Once emitted into the atmosphere, these pollutants are carried upward by wind currents, dispersed, and diluted over a broader area. During their journey through the atmosphere, they undergo chemical reactions with other airborne substances, including water vapor and oxygen, which results in the formation of secondary pollutants like sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). This is the initial phase of a multi-step process that eventually leads to the formation of acid rain. The acids formed in the atmosphere are now present in the form of small droplets or particles, which can then mix with cloud formations or be absorbed by rain, snow, or fog. When precipitation occurs, the acidified water droplets fall back to the Earth's surface, leading to the phenomenon known as acid rain. Acid rain has a multitude of ecological, environmental, and human health consequences. It can lead to the acidification of lakes and rivers, degradation of soil quality, loss of vegetation, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and even potential respiratory issues in humans and wildlife. Governments, scientists, and industry stakeholders have been working together over the past decades to mitigate the harmful impacts of acid rain by implementing policies and technologies designed to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, raise public awareness, and find sustainable alternatives for energy production and transportation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's important to note that the process mentioned in the beginning is about the process of respiration or breathing, not about how one develops Polio or any other diseases. The potential perturbation here pertains to a much broader medical context, beyond the specific process of respiration described. The enhanced medical care could likely affect steps in the process of the disease's progression, management, and treatment, but not directly or indirectly affect the presented process of breathing. It could potentially affect how a person's body responds to the Polio virus, or how they manage the symptoms of the disease, but those steps are not described in the given process. Hence, the answer is \\"not impacting any step of the process\\".

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes 95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft, which is later found out to be true and used to later set up Jack with a motive for robbing the bank) and goes out for a drink with colleague Harry Romano and potential employer, Bill Cox. Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home.

Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood, with no remaining founding members. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. In 1980, pop duo the Buggles (keyboardist Geoff Downes and singer Trevor Horn) acquired Brian Lane as a manager. At this point, the departure of Anderson and Wakeman had been kept secret from everyone outside the Yes inner circle. Seeing an option of continuing the band with new creative input and expertise, Squire revealed the situation to Horn and Downes and suggested that they join Yes as full-time members. Horn and Downes accepted the invitation and the reconfigured band recorded the Drama album, which was released in August 1980. The record displayed a heavier, harder sound than the material Yes recorded with Anderson in 1979, opening with the lengthy hard rocker \\"Machine Messiah\\". The album received substantial radio airplay in the late summer-fall of 1980, and peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 18 in the US, though it was the first Yes album to not be certified Gold by the RIAA since 1971. Their 1980 tour of North America and the UK received a mixed reaction from audiences. They were well received in the United States, and were awarded with a commemorative certificate after they performed a record 16 consecutive sold out concerts at Madison Square Garden since 1974. After the Drama tour, Yes reconvened in England to decide the band's next step, beginning by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn chose to leave Yes to pursue a career in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980. A live compilation album of Yes performances from 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released as Yesshows, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US. An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming that Yes no longer existed. Downes and Howe later reunited to form Asia with former King Crimson bassist and vocalist John Wetton, and drummer Carl Palmer from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. Squire and White continued to work together, initially recording sessions with Jimmy Page for a proposed band called XYZ (short for \\"ex-Yes-and-Zeppelin\\") in the spring of 1981. Page's former bandmate Robert Plant was also to be involved as the vocalist but he lost enthusiasm, citing his ongoing grieving for recently deceased Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. The short-lived group produced a few demo tracks, elements of which would appear in Page's band the Firm and on future Yes tracks \\"Mind Drive\\" and \\"Can You Imagine?\\". In late 1981, Squire and White released \\"Run with the Fox\\", a Christmas single with Squire on vocals which received radio airplay through the 1980s and early 1990s during the Christmas periods.

In commemoration, they create a giant shuttlecock and robotic replica figure of Perry to play an improvised game of badminton. However, when Perry's hovercraft accidentally collides with their shuttlecock, the boys crash into Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's laboratory and destroy his \\"Other-Dimension-Inator\\", which is designed to help him travel to parallel dimensions. Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention. The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area. The second Perry (known as Platyborg), was converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshimrtz-2 and programmed to serve as his second-in-command and general of his army of Norm-Bots. When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes.

One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D. Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C? Hint: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. The answer is:","completion":"Sample A would have a deeper thermocline than Sample C. This is because Sample A is taken from the Miami thermocline, which is located in the tropics, while Sample C is taken from the New York thermocline, which is in higher latitudes. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper due to the greater amount of solar energy received in the tropics, which heats surface water and creates a more dramatic difference in temperature with depth. In contrast, higher latitude regions, such as the area near New York, receive less solar energy, resulting in less heating of the surface water, and thus a shallower thermocline. Polar waters, in fact, often lack a thermocline entirely due to the similar temperatures of surface and deep waters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Paragraph: Two groups of friends went camping , but camped separately a few hundred yards away and started a fire each. Both groups had the same volume of wood.

Movie plot title: Stuck Movie plot: Thomas \\"Tom\\" Bardo (Stephen Rea) is having a particularly bad day; not only has his unemployment run out, but he has also been evicted from his apartment. Retirement-home caregiver Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari) is potentially up for a promotion at work, and celebrates with a night of drinking and Ecstasy before driving home. On the way home, Brandi hits Tom with her car and he becomes trapped in her car's windshield. Afraid of being arrested, Brandi continues to drive home with the promise that she will get Tom help. But as she begins to debate the issue, Brandi feels the accident will destroy her life and opts to take a taxi to work, leaving him to die slowly in her garage. When Tom realizes that, he painfully tries to escape. Brandi enlists the help of her boyfriend, Rashid (Russell Hornsby), in an attempt to kill and dispose of Tom. Meanwhile, Tom is able to pull himself free from the windshield, but before he is able to escape the garage, Rashid and Brandi restrain him. They go back into Brandi's house and decide to kill Tom, and hide the evidence by burning both Tom's corpse and the car. Rashid returns to the garage, and prepares to shoot the apparently unconscious Tom with a revolver. But Tom, secretly awake, manages to attack Rashid before stabbing him through the eye with a concealed pen, killing him. During the brawl, a shot is discharged from the gun, prompting Brandi to investigate. Tom tries to start the car, but Brandi enters the garage before he is able to do so. Tom knocks Brandi over and limps out of the garage towards the street, taking Rashid's gun with him. Brandi pursues Tom, wielding a hammer from the garage. Tom pleads with Brandi to stay back, not wanting to fire on her, but she subdues him with the hammer. She drags Tom back to the garage and begins dousing the room with gasoline, panicking. She hopes that the police will conclude that Tom broke in, attacked Rashid and accidentally became engulfed in flames while trying to burn the garage down. However, Tom is able to sneak back into the... Answer:","completion":"Brandi didn't drop Thomas off at the hospital primarily because of fear and selfishness. After hitting him with her car, she panicked and was afraid of facing the consequences of her actions, such as being arrested and losing her job. This fear led her to bring Tom to her home instead, convincing herself that she would get him help. However, the fear soon turned into selfishness, as Brandi began to consider the potential impact of the accident on her life and career. She was up for a promotion at work, and she worried that the accident would jeopardize her chances of getting it. This motivated her to not only abandon Tom in her garage but also to later conspire with her boyfriend, Rashid, to kill and dispose of him to cover up the crime. In conclusion, Brandi didn't drop Thomas off at the hospital because her fear and self-centeredness led her to prioritize her own well-being and future over Tom's life. Her actions escalated from neglect to a full-fledged attempt to cover up the hit-and-run, ultimately causing her to abandon any moral responsibility she had towards Tom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In ancient Rome, a \\"magistratus\\" was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters. - Historically a mandamento was the part of Italian territory under the jurisdiction of a \\"pretore\\" which is a kind of magistrate.

Introduction: In a tightly contested battle at the Gila River Arena on Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Kings and the Arizona Coyotes found themselves locked in a scoreless duel after two periods. With both teams eager to notch another win in their hunt for a playoff spot, the intensity was palpable. Step 2: Summarize key moments and plays in each period Next, I will focus on key moments in each of the first two periods, describing important plays, scoring chances, and saves made by the goalkeepers on both sides. First Period During the first period, both teams were evenly matched with the Kings and the Coyotes displaying solid defense and denying one another of any clear scoring opportunities. Kings' goaltender Cal Petersen and Coyotes' netminder Darcy Kuemper each made impressive saves to keep the game scoreless. The Kings were able to kill off an early penalty, with the Coyotes failing to capitalize on their power play chance. Second Period In the second period, the Kings and Coyotes continued to be deadlocked with neither team giving an inch. The Coyotes' Clayton Keller had a breakaway opportunity early in the period, but Kings' defenseman Drew Doughty made a timely poke-check to disrupt the shot. Kuemper also shined in the second period, stopping a dangerous wrap-around attempt from Kings' forward Anze Kopitar. Despite an increase in offensive pressure from both sides, neither team could find the back of the net. Step 3: Discuss key players and statistics After detailing key moments, I will discuss the important players from both teams and the overall statistical information from the game so far. Key Players and Statistics: - Goaltenders Cal Petersen (Kings) and Darcy Kuemper (Coyotes) have been crucial to the scoreless draw, making key saves throughout the first two periods. - Shot attempts: Los Angeles Kings have 21 shots on goal, while Arizona Coyotes have 18 shots on goal. - Power plays: Kings have successfully killed off one penalty while the Coyotes have not had any penalties called against them. - Hits: Kings have registered 14 hits, while the Coyotes have recorded 12 hits during the first two periods. Step 4: Preview the third period Finally, I will offer a brief preview of what to expect in the third period and the potential outcomes of the game. Third Period Preview: With both teams remaining scoreless after two periods, fans can anticipate a thrilling and high-intensity third period. It will be crucial for the Kings and Coyotes to stay disciplined and patient, waiting for the perfect opportunity to break the deadlock. Both teams will be looking for a strong performance from their star players, like Anze Kopitar and Clayton Keller, to make a difference as the game heads towards the final buzzer. Conclusion: In an intense night of hockey, the Los Angeles Kings and Arizona Coyotes have so far been unable to break through one another's defenses. The third period promises to be an exciting and hard-fought battle as each team looks to secure a crucial win in their quest for playoff contention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you're crafty and have some basic carpentry skills, constructing the walls and door of a DIY shed might be something you can achieve without breaking the bank. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of building a sturdy back wall, side walls, and front wall with a door opening, making your DIY shed dreams come true. Let's dive right in! Step 1: Mark the platform as a guide for the back wall To start, position yourself at the back of the platform where the back wall will be constructed. Using a chalk line or temporary marking paint, mark the platform to distinguish where the back wall will stand. This will serve as a guide when laying out the wall components and help ensure that the structure lines up correctly with the platform. Step 2: Lay out and nail the back wall boards Now that the platform has been marked, it's time to lay out the boards for the back wall. Arrange the studs, top plate, and bottom plate according to the design. Make sure to keep track of the spacing between the studs. Use a level to ensure that the studs are plumb and then nail each stud between the top and bottom plates. Step 3: Add plywood siding to the back wall Once your back wall frame is properly assembled, the next step involves adding a layer of plywood siding. Cut the plywood sheet to the dimensions of the frame. Then, attach the sheet to the wall frame using appropriate nails or screws, making sure that the edges are flush with the frame. This will provide additional strength and stability to the structure. Step 4: Repeat the process for the side walls With the back wall complete, it's time to construct the side walls. Follow the same process as the back wall, marking the platform and nailing the boards together before adding plywood siding. Make sure to measure and cut out any window or vent openings, if necessary, according to your design. Step 5: Measure the door and create a frame Begin by measuring the width and height of the door you plan to use. Take note of these dimensions to create a door frame that accommodates the selected door. Remember to include the jamb thickness, as well as ample room for shims and movement. Step 6: Build the front wall To build the front wall, follow the same procedures as the previous walls, marking the platform and nailing the boards together. Cut out the doorway opening according to the dimensions of your door frame, paying close attention to ensure that it is level and square. Install the door frame in the opening, making sure it is plumb and properly aligned. Add plywood siding to the front wall, just as you did for the other walls. Step 7: Make triangular braces for the side walls To support the roof and add sturdiness to the structure, create triangular pieces for the side walls. Measure and cut the triangular pieces according to the angle and dimensions of the roof. Then, nail these triangles into the top of the side walls, making sure they are properly aligned with the roof's angle. Conclusion: With your walls now built and braced, you're well on your way to completing your very own DIY shed. The steps outlined above demonstrate just how straightforward designing and building a shed can be with the right tools, materials, and mindset. Whether you plan to use your shed for storage or as a workspace, the satisfaction of constructing it yourself will make it all the more enjoyable to use. So, gear up, follow the steps, and before you know it, you'll have a durable, functional, and attractive shed to be proud of!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Groups Say Changes to Labor Law Won't Do Enough for Veterans Even before President Obama said last week that he would speed the pullout of American troops from Afghanistan, the Department of Labor was trying to strengthen a Vietnam-era law designed to make sure returning soldiers get jobs. Some longtime veterans complain, though, that the wording of the law isn’t the problem. Instead, they say, the law isn’t enforced well, complaints aren’t handled promptly, and contractors are failing to adequately inform veterans about the law, as required. In many cases veterans don’t even know the law exists, they say. The Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act, or VEVRAA, requires companies that have contracts with the federal government — nearly 110,000 at last count, including companies like commercial airlines that transport mail, consulting firms and electronics manufacturers — to actively seek out veterans when hiring, and forbids discrimination against them when filling jobs and promoting employees. Veterans who qualify include disabled and recently discharged soldiers and soldiers who served in military campaigns and operations for which a campaign badge or an Armed Forces Service Medal was issued. “Increasing numbers of veterans are returning from duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world only to face substantial obstacles in finding employment,” the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs said in a recent report explaining why it was considering strengthening the law. Post-9/11 veterans have higher rates of unemployment than nonveterans and older veterans, according to a Congressional report issued in May. Some of that higher unemployment may be because the industries that often employed veterans shrank during the recession, the report found. Mr. Obama said last Wednesday that he would bring 10,000 troops back to the United States this year from Afghanistan and 23,000 more by next summer. The Department of Labor’s proposed changes include requiring contracting companies to keep better data about veterans applying for jobs and hiring rates, increasing recruitment and ramping up outreach efforts to veterans. The government recently extended the public comment period for these changes from June 27 to July 11 and is taking comments on a federal Web site. Some longtime veterans complain that the wording of the law isn’t the problem. Instead, they say, the law isn’t enforced well, complaints aren’t handled promptly and contractors are failing to adequately inform veterans about the law, as required. In many cases veterans don’t even know they are eligible for preferential hiring, they say. Veterans groups have long criticized the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, the division of the Department of Labor responsible for enforcing the law. The OFCCP, as it is known, “has long had the (justified) reputation of being a moribund agency within the Department of Labor who did little, if anything, to help anyone, much less veterans,” Rick Weidman, executive director for the Vietnam Veterans of America, said in testimony before Congress last year. The OFCCP should be more active, he said. “The message needs to get out that there are consequences to noncompliance,” he said.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Wrays, also known as The Wray Brothers Band, were an American country music group from Oregon composed of Bubba Wray, Jim Covert, Lynn Phillips and Joe Dale Cleghorn. Following two independent singles, The Wrays released a pair of singles on Mercury Records in the 1980s. Their highest charing single, \\"You Lay a Lotta Love on Me,\\" reached the Top 50 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles chart in 1987. After The Wrays broke up, lead singer Bubba Wray launched a successful solo career as Collin Raye. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Tom Shapiro (born in Kansas City, Missouri) is an American songwriter and occasional record producer, known primarily for his work in country music. To date, he holds four Country Songwriter of the Year awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated, as well as the Songwriter of the Decade award from the Nashville Songwriters Association International. He has also written more than fifty Top Ten hits, including twenty-six Number Ones. - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. - \\"Somebody Else's Moon\\" is a song written by Tom Shapiro and Paul Nelson, and recorded by American country music singer Collin Raye. It was released in March 1993 as the third single from his album, \\"In This Life.\\" The song reached the Top 5 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and peaked at number 11 on the Canadian \\"RPM\\" Country Tracks chart. - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - In This Life is the second studio album released by country music artist Collin Raye . Its title track was Raye 's second Number One hit ; \`\` That Was a River '' , \`\` Somebody Else 's Moon '' and \`\` I Want You Bad ( And That Ai n't Good ) '' were also released as singles . \`\` Big River '' is a cover of a Johnny Cash song , while \`\` Let It Be Me '' is a cover of a pop standard originally recorded by Betty Everett and Jerry Butler . - Floyd Elliot Wray (born August 22, 1960) is an American country music singer, known professionally as Collin Raye, and previously as Bubba Wray. Under the latter name, he recorded as a member of the band The Wrays between 1983 and 1987. He made his solo debut in 1991 as Collin Raye with the album \\"All I Can Be\\", which produced his first Number One hit in \\"Love, Me\\". \\"All I Can Be\\" was the first of four consecutive albums released by Raye to achieve platinum certification in the United States for sales of one million copies each. Raye maintained several Top Ten hits throughout the rest of the decade and into 2000. 2001's \\"Can't Back Down\\" was his first album that did not produce a Top 40 country hit, and he was dropped by his record label soon afterward. He did not record another studio album until 2005's \\"Twenty Years and Change\\", released on an independent label. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Twenty Years and Change is the eighth studio album, released in 2005, by country music artist Collin Raye. His first studio album in 3 years, it produced the singles \\"I Know That's Right\\" and \\"Hurricane Jane\\", neither of which charted. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - All I Can Be is the debut studio album of American country music artist Collin Raye. It features the hit singles \\"All I Can Be (Is a Sweet Memory)\\" (originally recorded by Conway Twitty as \\"All I Can Be Is a Sweet Memory\\" on his 1985 album \\"Chasin' Rainbows\\"), \\"Love, Me\\" (Raye's first #1 on the \\"Billboard\\" country charts), and \\"Every Second\\". The final track, \\"If I Were You\\", is a different song than the song of the same name recorded on Raye's 1994 album \\"Extremes\\". \\"Any Ole Stretch of Blacktop\\" was later recorded by Shenandoah as a new track for their 1992 \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. - \\"Love, Me\\" is a song written by Skip Ewing and Max T. Barnes, and recorded by American country music artist Collin Raye. It was released in October 1991 as the second single from the album \\"All I Can Be\\". In January 1992, the single became Raye's first Number One single on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts; the same year, the song received a Song of the Year nomination from the Country Music Association. The single has been cited as a popular choice for funerals. - \\"That Was A River\\" is a song written by Susan Longacre and Rick Giles, and recorded by American country music singer Collin Raye that peaked at number 4 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. It was released in July 1993 as the fourth and final single from his CD \\"In This Life.\\" - Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, dating back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues, and electric blues. - Can't Back Down is the seventh studio album released by country music artist Collin Raye. It was also his last album for Epic Records, and the first album of his career not to produce any Top 40 country hits. \\"Ain't Nobody Gonna Take That from Me\\", the first single, reached #43 on the Hot Country Songs charts. \\"What I Need\\", the second single, failed to chart. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Betty Everett (November 23, 1939 August 19, 2001) was an American soul singer and pianist, best known for her biggest hit single, the million-selling \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\". - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. What is the relationship between 'in this life ' and 'epic records'? Answer:","completion":"\\"In This Life\\" is the second studio album released by American country music artist Collin Raye. It was released in 1992 and features the hit singles \\"In This Life,\\" \\"Somebody Else's Moon,\\" \\"That Was a River,\\" and \\"I Want You Bad (And That Ain't Good).\\" The album helped to further establish Raye as a successful country music artist during the 1990s. Epic Records is the record label responsible for releasing \\"In This Life.\\" They played a crucial role in producing and distributing the album, as well as promoting Collin Raye's music to a broader audience. In summary, the relationship between \\"In This Life\\" and Epic Records lies in the fact that the record label was responsible for releasing and promoting Collin Raye's album, which contributed to his success in the country music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: No Halloween for sex offenders? They challenge California city's restrictions Registered sex offenders in California are suing to block a Simi Valley law that would keep them from putting up Halloween decorations and require them to display a \\"No Candy or Treats\\" sign. WNBC's Ted Chen reports. An attorney representing five Simi Valley sex offenders who sued the city over limits to their Halloween activities said the lawsuit will be the first of several she expects to file over such restrictions. Lawyer Janice Bellucci heads the 18-month-old advocacy group California Reform Sex Offender Laws. On Friday, she filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that Simi Valley's ordinance violates her clients' First Amendment rights. The suit seeks a judge's order prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance in Simi Valley, which has 119 registered sex offenders, according to a city report. Bellucci is representing five unnamed sex offenders, three of their spouses and two minor children, she said. The ordinance, adopted Sept. 10, prohibits registered sex offenders in the Ventura County city of about 125,000 from displaying Halloween decorations, answering the door to trick-or-treaters or having outside lighting after dark on Oct. 31. Simi Valley councilman and LAPD officer Mike Judge said the law is modeled after similar Halloween laws enforced in other California cities, and is meant to protect children. \\"This law was generated by citizens asking the City Council to do something,\\" Judge said. \\"And it didn’t seem unreasonable for the City Council to take it up. \\"As far as I’m concerned, our law doesn’t go as far as other laws in the state of California and it still, in our opinion, protects our children a little bit better than not having it.\\" Registered sex offenders are also required to post signs with on their front doors reading, in 1-inch letters, \\"No candy or treats at this residence.\\" Those offenders visible to the public on the state's Megan's Law website and convicted of a crime against a child are required to post the sign. Stay informed with the latest headlines; sign up for our newsletter Sixty-seven of the city's offenders are listed on the website, according to a city report; the rest are convicted of misdemeanors and don't have their names on the public list. Bellucci said the sign-posting requirement was \\"particularly egregious.\\" \\"We consider that to be a violation of the U.S. Constitution,\\" Bellucci said Tuesday.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Alex conceived a child with them even though they used protection. Given the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\", is \\"Like a virgin\\" a valid answer? Pick your answer from: (I) Yes. (II) No. Answer:","completion":"Answer: II) No. Like a virgin\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would others feel as a result?\\" when referring to Alex conceiving a child even while using protection. The phrase \\"like a virgin\\" indicates a feeling of innocence and new experiences, and does not directly relate to the situation described. Furthermore, it does not address the question of how others would feel in this context. To give a more appropriate and detailed response to the question, we can analyze the possible feelings and emotions that others might experience given the circumstances. 1. Shock and disbelief: If Alex and their partner used protection, others might initially feel shock and disbelief upon hearing the news. It is a common belief that using protection significantly reduces the chances of conception, and learning that conception occurred despite taking precautions can be surprising and unexpected. 2. Sympathy and concern: Others may feel sympathy and concern for both Alex and their partner as they navigate this unexpected situation. They may worry about their plans, financial stability, and emotional well-being given the potentially life-altering event. Moreover, others may share advice, resources, or their own experiences to help ease the couple's concerns. 3. Curiosity and questioning: Some people might feel curious about how or why conception occurred despite using protection. This could lead to discussions about the effectiveness of various birth control methods, instances of user error, and the importance of using protection correctly and consistently. 4. Support and encouragement: Friends and family may feel the need to rally around Alex and their partner to offer emotional support and encouragement. This support could involve showing understanding, expressing excitement about the potential addition to the family, or offering practical assistance. 5. Mixed emotions: As in any situation involving unexpected news, some people may have mixed emotions. They might struggle to reconcile their feelings of surprise and concern with any happiness or excitement they may feel for the couple. It is important for those experiencing mixed emotions to communicate their feelings openly with Alex and their partner to maintain strong relationships. In conclusion, the phrase \\"like a virgin\\" does not provide a valid or accurate representation of how others would feel as a result of Alex conceiving a child despite using protection. A more appropriate answer would include an exploration of the complex range of emotions that individuals may experience in response to this news, taking into consideration each person's relationship to Alex and their partner, as well as their own beliefs and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Louis Requena/MLB Photos via Getty Images Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday with at least 75 percent of the vote from the Golden Era committee. Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday with at least 75 percent of the vote from the Golden Era committee. Ron Santo wanted this day for so long, and now that it’s finally here, he isn’t. The Hall of Fame call , the one he waited for and agonized over pretty much his entire adult life, came on Monday, but he’s no longer with us to answer the phone and hear this: “Ronnie, welcome to the Hall of Fame.” And that’s not right.He was asked once, on one of the many days a new group of inductees was announced and he wasn’t among them, if he’d be OK getting a spot in Cooperstown, even if it came after he died. And, in that style that endeared him to generations of Cubs fans, he said “I don’t want to go in post-humorously.” Of course, he meant posthumously, but then an E-5 on words was part of what made Ron Santo.I spent seven years in Chicago, covering the Cubs and White Sox, and to this day say the most interesting person I’ve ever covered was Ozzie Guillen. The most impressive was Ron Santo. And for so many people, Ron Santo didn’t belong in the Hall because he was one of the best third basemen of his generation. They didn’t want him in because of his 342 homers, 1,331 RBIs and 2,254 hits. I mean, those were good enough reasons. But so many of them wanted him in because he was Ron Santo.I know it’s not the best baseball argument, and that writers who serve as gatekeepers to Cooperstown shouldn’t vote with their hearts with something as important as entry into the Hall of Fame. But all those people that wanted Ron Santo in for being simply Ron Santo, I get it. So no, this isn’t a piece about the numbers and the on-field credentials.I admit that when I first arrived in Chicago, I didn’t understand what Ron Santo meant to the city, to these people, to Cubs fans and to those suffering from diabetes. To me, he was a shrieking, name-mispronouncing homer cluttering up a radio broadcast. Before his health rapidly declined, Santo took a few days off from Cubs broadcasts. In his absence, I wrote a column for the small suburban newspaper for which I worked, a piece saying what a break it would be for his partner, the classy Pat Hughes, to have a few days off from Ronnie’s malapropisms, from the recaps of his between-innings trips to the bathroom, from his butchering of the English language. I recalled some of his classic mistakes. (Note: Let’s get something straight, I wrote this before the leg amputations, before the bladder cancer, before the suffering reached the unimaginable levels it would in the years to come. I mean, even I’m not heartless enough to pick on someone fighting debilitating illnesses). People wanted me fired. Or shot. Or fired, and then shot. And you know, they had a point. All these years later, I regret nothing more in my professional life than that column. I was young and stupid. Mostly, I couldn’t have been more wrong.No, these aren’t baseball arguments, but if you spent time around Ron Santo, you quickly realize you don’t think with your mind, you think with your heart. You don’t think the radio broadcast going off the rails is ridiculous; you think it fits, it’s perfect. ( Here’s a brief, but oh-so-perfect sampling ).Ron Santo was the crazy grandfather who overlooked your flaws; seriously, how else could someone love some of those awful Cubs teams the way Ronnie did. He was the voice of a fight, raising millions upon millions for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). He was a stubborn patient, the one who wouldn’t let the disease -- actually, the diseases -- keep him from living his life. I saw no-hitters and 60-homer seasons in Chicago; I saw a team on the other side of town win a World Series. Yet, the achievement that stands above all else was watching Ron Santo, on two prostheses, work his way down that steep flight of stairs into the Cubs’ clubhouse, finally get to the bottom and smile. Not complain. Never complain. Smile. Walk through the clubhouse and say hello to reporters and players and clubhouse staff, asking “How you feeling today, big boy?”Oh, I saw or heard about some funny ones, too. About the hairpiece catching on fire in the booth at Shea Stadium. The countless drinks he spilled on his notes or the fax machine in the broadcast booth. And, oh, the mess he made with words. OK, so the man could never remember my last name. And so, to see what kind of torture we could put him through, his partners handed him a piece of paper during a broadcast so he could wish me happy birthday on the air. He looked at the 15 letters and fought for 10 minutes -- live on radio -- that there’s no way that “Pietruszkiewicz” was a real last name. I still have the tape. Listening to everyone laughing in the background might be the best birthday wish I ever got.In a city that loved people with one name -- Jordan Ditka Sweetness Ernie -- it’s not an exaggeration to say the name they loved the most was Ronnie.And in his life, too short but incredibly well lived, he wanted two things more than anything -- a World Series title for his Cubs and to hear someone say, “Ronnie, welcome to the Hall of Fame.”I wish we could all see him push himself out of his chair on that stage this summer, surrounded by Hall of Famers -- fellow Hall of Famers -- and fumble and mumble and shriek his way through a speech that wouldn’t leave a dry eye anywhere in Cooperstown.Yes, this is a happy day. It’s a sad one, too.Nick Pietruszkiewicz is an editor for ESPN.com Follow him on Twitter at npiet_ESPN ||||| Oh, yesssssss! The guy who immortalized the “oh, nooooo’’ call when Brant Brown dropped that fly ball is heading to the Hall of Fame. Ron Santo is joining Cub teammates Ernie Banks Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins in baseball’s Hall of Fame. He was elected by the Veteran’s Committee in so-called Golden Era (1947-72) balloting announced Monday morning.While Cub fans can rejoice, the news wasn’t good on the other side of Chicago. Latin American pioneer and White Sox fan favorite Minnie Minoso was bypassed for the Hall in voting.The 16-member committee included Williams, former White Sox general manager Roland Hemond and Chicago Tribune baseball writer Dave Van Dyck. The voters reviewed 10 candidates, each of which needed 12 votes for election.Santo received 15 votes, according to Hall Chairman Jane Forbes Clark. Jim Kaat was second in voting with 10 votes, followed by Minoso and Gil Hodges with nine each and Tony Oliva with eight.Also on the ballot were executives Buzzie Bavasi and Charlie Finley, along with perennial All-Stars Luis Tiant, Ken Boyer and Allie Reynolds.Santo’s election is bittersweet as it comes one year and two days after his death. He battled diabetes throughout his life, including in a 15-year career in which he hit .277 with 342 home runs and 1,331 RBIs while winning five consecutive Gold Gloves.Santo, an All-Star in nine seasons, is ranked as the sixth best third baseman of all time by baseball analyst Bill James but previously had been bypassed for the Hall by the Baseball Writers Association of America and the Veterans Committee when it was comprised almost exclusively of living Hall of Famers. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo has been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving at least 75% of the vote from the Golden Era committee.

On Wednesday night people in the Bahçelievler district of Yenibosna in Istanbul, Turkey, claimed that they had seen a UFO flying in the sky, the Turkish newspaper Sabah reports. They said that the UFO was glowing with white lights and that it revolved around itself. Istanbul has had previous UFO incidents in the past, and in 2002, the Istanbul UFO Museum was opened to the public. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? A UFO might have been seen in Turkey.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A UFO might have been seen in Turkey\\" indeed follows the preceding text. Based on the information provided, it can be noted that residents in the Bahçelievler district of Yenibosna, in Istanbul, Turkey reportedly claimed to have spotted a UFO in the sky. According to these accounts, which were reported in the Turkish newspaper Sabah, the UFO was radiating white lights and was revolving around itself. This is not an isolated incident, as the text also mentions that Istanbul has been the site of previous UFO sightings in the past. This suggests that there is a historical trend and expectation for such occurrences in this location. The existence of the Istanbul UFO Museum, which was opened in 2002, supports this idea, indicating that there is a significant enough interest and expectation of UFO sightings for such an establishment to be justified in the city. Given this context, the next sentence \\"A UFO might have been seen in Turkey\\" could be seen as not only a logical assertion based on the people's claim in the Bahçelievler district of Yenibosna, but also as a continuation and affirmation of previous trends of similar sightings in Istanbul, therefore, in a broader sense, in Turkey. Although this sentence changes from a specific location (Istanbul) to a broader one (Turkey), it nonetheless encapsulates the essence of these events. This vaguer statement still maintains coherence with the previously provided information. However, it's crucial to understand the uncertain nature of these events, often relayed first-hand from eyewitness testimony, and filtered through media sources, which might elevate or amplify certain aspects for various reasons ranging from sensationalism to genuine belief in the phenomena. Therefore, the proposed sentence correctly uses the modal verb \\"might,\\" suggesting that while such a sighting has been reported, it is not definitively confirmed. This aligns well with the inherent uncertainty and controversy surrounding UFO sightings in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period. Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about 100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well. The paint used on cars can _ .

At the age of four, Sudano learned to play his first instrument, the accordion. He later taught himself to play piano and guitar. He soon developed a reputation in his community as a talented musician and got his first paid gig at the age of twelve. In 1977, Sudano, Esposito and Hokenson moved to Los Angeles, formed the band Brooklyn Dreams and signed a recording deal with Millennium Records. That same year, Skip Konte of Three Dog Night produced their first self-titled debut. The trio scored a modest hit with the single \\"Music, Harmony and Rhythm\\", which they performed on American Bandstand. On March 13, 1977, Sudano met Donna Summer, who was signed to Casablanca Records. Casablanca was the distributor for Sudano's label Millennium Records. The Brooklyn Dreams and Summer immediately began writing songs together and within a few months Sudano and Summer were dating. In 1978, the band penned \\"Take It to the Zoo\\" with Summer for the Thank God It's Friday soundtrack. The same year, the Brooklyn Dreams appeared in the movie American Hot Wax performing as the Planotones, a group created for the movie with long time friend Kenny Vance. They scored a Top 5 hit when they appeared on the single \\"Heaven Knows\\" with Esposito and Summer singing a duet. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became a certified million-selling Gold single in 1979. In 1979, Brooklyn Dreams and Summer wrote the title track \\"Bad Girls\\" for the best selling album of Summers' career Bad Girls. In addition to the title track, Sudano also co-wrote the songs \\"Lucky\\" and \\"On My Honor\\" with Summer and Harold Faltermeyer as well as \\"Can't Get to Sleep At Night\\" with Bob Conti. He then wrote the song \\"I'm A Rainbow\\", which was the title track to Summer's next LP. Unfortunately, it was shelved by Geffen Records and not released until 1996. When Millennium Records changed their distribution to RCA, the Brooklyn Dreams contract was transferred to Casablanca Records. Under their new recording contract, Brooklyn Dreams recorded three more studio LPs. They released two albums in 1979: Sleepless Nights, produced by Bob Esty, and Joyride produced by Jurgen Koppers, an engineer for Giorgio Moroder. In 1980, they made their fourth and final album Won't Let Go, which they produced themselves. A song from this record, \\"Hollywood Knights\\" became the title track for the comedy The Hollywood Knights starring Tony Danza, Michelle Pfeiffer and Fran Drescher. In 2008, \\"Hollywood Knights\\" was sampled by Snoop Dogg on his song \\"Deez Hollywood Nights\\". Brooklyn Dreams amicably disbanded in 1980 when Hokensen returned to New York after his mother died. Sudano and Summer continued writing songs together and were married the same year.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more money made available for space programmes happens, how will it affect air is inhaled through the lung. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of more money being made available for space programs does not have a direct effect on the process of air being inhaled through the lungs. This process, known as respiration, is a fundamental physiological function that allows living organisms to breathe and maintain life. It involves the inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide, and is not directly influenced by external factors such as funding allocated for space programs. However, there might be some indirect effects due to the perturbation. Increased funding for space programs could lead to advancements in technology that may contribute to improvements in air quality on Earth or the development of systems to provide breathable air for humans in space. This, in turn, might indirectly affect the air that is inhaled through the lungs. For example, investments in space technology could result in innovations that help reduce air pollution on Earth. This would indirectly improve the quality of the air we breathe, thus positively influencing the health of our respiratory system. On the other hand, the development of advanced life support systems for space exploration could include technologies for air purification and oxygen generation in a closed environment. These systems could have applications in different areas, such as improving indoor air quality or providing temporary breathable environments for rescue operations.

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services. - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants. - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants. Postal codes in the Borgne Arrondissement start with the number 15. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - Borgne ( Haitian Creole : Obòy ) is a commune in the north coast of Haiti , west of Cap - Haïtien and northwest of Limbé , in Nord Department . The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery . Other nearby places include Port - Margot , Robin , and Fond La Grange . Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \`\` sister cities '' relationship with Honeoye Falls , New York , United States . Satellite view of Borgne - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti. A hospital is located there. The hospital is run by the Alyans Sante Borgne, a partnership between the nongovernmental organization H.O.P.E.

Marty wanted to make a ladder golf to replace his corn hole game. Because the","completion":"materials for corn hole were becoming worn out, he decided ladder golf would be a more durable option. To build his ladder golf set, Marty followed these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather materials Marty started by making a list of the materials he would need, including PVC pipes, PVC connectors, elbows, and tees. He also purchased durable golf balls and nylon ropes to create the bolas. This step was important to ensure that he had all the required materials before starting the construction process. Step 2: Cut PVC pipes Next, Marty cut the PVC pipes to the desired lengths, which would help form the base and uprights for the ladder golf set. By measuring and cutting the pipes accurately, Marty ensured the stability of the structure, thus making it safe for playing. Step 3: Assemble the base Marty then connected the base of his ladder golf set using the PVC connectors, elbows, and tees. Proper assembly was essential, as it would provide a stable foundation for the game, preventing it from toppling over during play. Step 4: Attach the uprights After assembling the base, Marty added the uprights to create the ladder-like structure. By attaching these pieces and ensuring proper alignment, the ladder would be more stable and the bolas would hang correctly during the game. Step 5: Create the bolas Marty then drilled holes in the golf balls and threaded the nylon ropes through them. He made sure to tie secure knots at both ends to prevent the golf balls from slipping off during the game. The bolas needed to be well-constructed, as they would be tossed at the ladder during gameplay. Step 6: Paint the structure To make the ladder golf set visually appealing and to protect it from the elements, Marty applied a coat of paint. He chose bright colors for the ladder and contrasting colors for the bolas, making it easier to see and more enjoyable to play. Step 7: Test the game Finally, Marty tested his newly-built ladder golf set by playing a few rounds with friends and family. This step was crucial, as it provided a chance for Marty to identify any potential issues with the structure and make necessary adjustments. Marty's ladder golf set successfully replaced his worn-out corn hole game and provided endless entertainment. By carefully following these steps, Marty was able to create a durable and enjoyable outdoor game for everyone to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the review content - The product was a canner - The product was a birthday present for the reviewer's sister - The product arrived quickly with standard shipping - The sister was excited to get it - The reviewer would order from this seller again - The sister hasn't used the product yet Step 2: Consider the factors impacting the decision - Fast shipping: Positive - Sister's excitement: Positive - Reviewer's willingness to order again: Positive - Lack of actual product usage: Negative (neutral if not considering reliability) Step 3: Weigh the factors - The first three factors indicate a good buying experience, which is a positive sign. - The lack of actual product usage prevents a full assessment of the product's reliability and performance, limiting the review's usefulness. Step 4: Determine the effect of the review Considering the above factors, the review would likely slightly increase the chances of buying the product. The positive aspects of the review, such as fast shipping and the buyer's willingness to order again, outweigh the lack of information on the product's actual performance. However, the lack of product usage may encourage the potential buyer to seek additional reviews to obtain more comprehensive information before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"mirrors cause\\" is \\"direct energy\\", given that mirrors cause refraction of light? The answer is:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"mirrors cause\\" is not \\"direct energy,\\" given that mirrors cause refraction of light. Step 1: Understanding the terms involved - Mirrors: Reflective surfaces, typically made of glass with a reflective metal coating, that reflect light. - Cause: The agent or process responsible for an event or change. - Refraction: The change in direction of a wave, such as light, when it passes through a medium with a different refractive index. - Direct Energy: A term that could involve converting energy from one form to another, usually in a targeted manner. Step 2: Analyzing the relationship between mirrors and direct energy - Mirrors are known for reflecting light, not necessarily for directing energy. - The process of reflection may involve some redirection of light energy, but it is not the main purpose of using mirrors. Step 3: Comparing the relationship between mirrors and refraction vs. mirrors and direct energy - Mirrors cause reflection, not refraction, of light. Reflection involves the change in direction of a light wave when it bounces off a surface, while refraction is the change in direction of a light wave as it passes through a medium with a different refractive index. - Although mirrors may influence the path of light, their primary function is reflection, not directing energy. Based on these steps and the clarification of the concepts involved, the right answer to the question \\"mirrors cause\\" would be \\"reflection of light\\" rather than \\"direct energy.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Now, I have a new situation: Sarah and Sophie are sisters living in two different cities. Sarah lives in a very rural area with hardly any air pollution. Sophie lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with many factories and people driving cars to their destinations. This all leads to Sophie's city having a large amount of pollution going into the atmosphere. Answer this question please: Who is more susceptible to other diseases?","completion":"Based on the background and situation provided, Sophie, who lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with significant air pollution, is more susceptible to other diseases. Air pollution is a significant environmental and health hazard. It is known to cause a myriad of health problems with the most damning being cardiopulmonary diseases, such as asthma and lung cancer, and premature death. About 22 million people globally die each year due to air pollution, making it a compelling public health concern that needs to be addressed. Sophie living in an urban, heavily industrialized city is constantly exposed to various airborne pollutants such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide among others. These pollutants are predominantly released from human activities such as manufacturing processes in industries, exhaust emissions from vehicles, burning fossil fuels for energy, and so forth. When inhaled, these toxins infiltrate the bloodstream through the respiratory system, subsequently causing inflammation and damage to various body organs thus leading to serious health complications over time. In contrast, Sarah lives in a rural area where the air is significantly cleaner due to fewer pollutant sources. In such places, the air quality tends to be much better since there are fewer industries and less vehicular traffic. Therefore, the level of exposure to air pollutants is lower, reducing the risks of developing related health complications. Children, as mentioned earlier, are more susceptible to the negative impacts of air pollution due to their developing lungs and the higher ratio of air intake to their body size compared to adults. However, without knowledge of Sarah and Sophie's ages or information that they are children, we're left to base our considerations on their environmental living situations. Therefore, given the environmental circumstances, Sophie is more susceptible to other diseases due to the higher levels of air pollution in the urban, industrialized area she lives in. Bear in mind that numerous other factors, like individual health, lifestyle, genetic predisposition, access to healthcare services, nutrition, and physical activity, can also contribute to disease susceptibility which hasn't been accounted for in this analysis. Nonetheless, on the sole basis of the environmental context provided, Sophie faces a higher risk."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right.

Thank goodness she was a nurse -- she might be able to help these unfortunate passengers. Then she stopped. What about Ben? She couldn't take him with her. Little boys shouldn't see scenes like this one. But was it safe to leave him alone? For a little moment Barbara thought of going on her way. Someone else was sure to come along. No! \\"Ben, honey, promise me you'll stay in the car!\\" \\"I will, Mommy,\\" he said as she ran. Two girls of high school age were in the car. One was dead and the driver was still breathing. But if help came soon, the girl would live. A trucker had pulled up and was calling for help on his cell phone. Soon Barbara heard the ambulance sirens . Later, Barbara was able to meet the families of the victims . They expressed their gratitude for the help she had provided. Question: What did Barbara do? _ Options: A: A doctor. B: A nurse.

The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic. Which group might act as a magnet, group A or group B? Hint: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. A:","completion":"Based on the description provided, group A would be the one that might act as a magnet. This is because all the objects in group A are magnetic, meaning they have properties that allow them to be attracted by a magnet and act as a magnet themselves. This characteristic arises from the alignment of the atoms within the material, as mentioned in the hint. In contrast, group B contains non-magnetic objects, so they will not display any of the properties associated with magnetism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Calcium is an alkaline earth metal, which is situated in group 2 (or IIA) of the periodic table of elements. Its symbol is \\"Ca\\". Calcium is an essential element for living organisms and has various functions, including being a major component of bones and teeth, cell signaling, and acting as a cofactor for many enzymes. Calcium is a fairly reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical properties are typical for metals; it is soft and has a silver-grayish color when freshly cut. Calcium also has a relatively low melting point and boiling point compared to other metals, with its melting point at 842°C (1548°F) and boiling point at 1484°C (2703°F). Calcium is the fifth most abundant element on Earth, making up about 3% of the Earth's crust. It is found in various minerals, such as limestone, gypsum, and fluorite. It is also the most abundant metal by mass in many animals, mainly in the skeleton and shell structures. The most common compound of calcium is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is found in rocks, shells, and eggshells. Other important calcium compounds include calcium oxide (CaO), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2), and calcium sulfate (CaSO4). Calcium is an essential nutrient for living organisms as it plays a crucial role in their survival and growth. In humans, calcium is necessary for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It also participates in muscle function, nerve impulse transmission, blood clotting, and various enzymatic processes. Calcium deficiencies can lead to various health disorders, such as osteoporosis, hypocalcemia, and rickets. On the other hand, excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, which can result in kidney stone formation, muscle weakness, and other problems. Therefore, maintaining a proper balance of calcium in the body is crucial for overall health. To ensure optimal calcium levels, it is important to consume calcium-rich foods such as dairy products, leafy green vegetables, nuts, and fish. In some cases, calcium supplements may be recommended for individuals at risk of developing a deficiency. In summary, calcium is a common chemical element with an atomic number of 20, playing a vital role in various physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth. Its presence in living organisms, including humans, is crucial for proper growth, development, and maintenance of various systems, especially bones and teeth. Maintaining adequate calcium levels through a balanced diet is essential for overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Tariff Act of 1930 (codified at ), otherwise known as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff or Hawley–Smoot Tariff, was an act implementing protectionist trade policies sponsored by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley and signed into law on June 17, 1930. The act raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. The tariffs (this does not include duty-free imports – see \\"Tariff levels\\" below) under the act were the second-highest in the U.S. in 100 years, exceeded by a small margin by the Tariff of 1828. The Act and following retaliatory tariffs by America's trading partners helped reduce American exports and imports by more than half during the Depression. Although economists disagree by how much, the consensus view among economists and economic historians is that \\"The passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression.\\" In 1922, Congress passed the Fordney–McCumber Tariff act which increased tariffs on imports. The League of Nations' World Economic Conference met at Geneva in 1927, concluding in its final report: \\"the time has come to put an end to tariffs, and to move in the opposite direction.\\" Vast debts and reparations could only be repaid through gold, services or goods; but the only items available on that scale were goods.

Question: suppose there is less ground water available happens, how will it affect less evaporating water is collected in the process. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If there is less groundwater available, it will lead to less evaporating water being collected in the process. This is because the amount of water available for evaporation directly impacts the amount of water that can be collected through the process as described. With a reduced amount of groundwater, there will be less raw material to begin the evaporation process, and ultimately less evaporated water collected. The second effect mentioned is more salt being removed from the water. The supposed perturbation of having less groundwater available will result in less salt being removed in total. This is because the salt removal process is directly proportional to the amount of water being evaporated and collected. As the available water decreases, there will be less water to evaporate and consequently, less opportunity to remove salt from the water. However, the concentration of salt being removed per amount of water evaporated may remain constant or even slightly increase, as the salt is concentrated within the remaining water. In conclusion, less groundwater available will lead to less evaporating water collected, which in turn will result in less total salt being removed from the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Until now, the information was so secret it was not included in official papers released under the 30-year rule. It has been made public following a BBC Freedom of Information request. News of people refusing an OBE, CBE or knighthood in the annual New Year or Birthday Honours list normally only comes to light if they volunteer the information themselves or reports are leaked. In total 277 people are named on the list including the painters Francis Bacon and LS Lowry, the sculptor Henry Moore and novelist Aldous Huxley. It shows that Lowry turned down more honours than anybody else, with a total of five, including an OBE in 1955, a CBE in 1961 and a knighthood in 1968. Bacon turned down a CBE in 1960, while Freud refused the honour in the 1977 New Year's Honours list. Dahl, who rejected an OBE in 1986, was among a number of writers who snubbed the accolade including CS Lewis, who turned down a CBE in 1952. Film director Sir Alfred Hitchcock turned down a CBE in 1962, but went on to accept a knighthood from the Queen four months before his death in 1980. More on this 'alternative honours list' The Cabinet Office had been fighting the Freedom of Information request for more than a year but was ordered to release the information by the Information Commissioner's Office. In the past a number of famous people have rejected or returned honours bestowed upon them by the monarch. Beatles legend John Lennon returned his MBE in 1969, with a note to the Queen saying: \\"Your Majesty, I am returning this in protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts. \\"With Love, John Lennon of Bag.\\" In 2007, co-founder of lingerie brand Agent Provocateur Joseph Corre also rejected the title, accusing Tony Blair of being \\"morally corrupt\\". Writer J G Ballard, who also rejected a CBE, is on record as saying he was opposed to the \\"preposterous charade\\" of the honours system. Honours have sometimes been forfeited when a recipient was convicted of a criminal offence. That list includes Irish-born colonial officer Roger Casement, who was convicted of treason for aiding those involved in Ireland's 1916 Easter Rising and executed. The publication of the list comes as senior civil servants are due to decide whether ex-Royal Bank of Scotland boss Sir Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his knighthood. The work of the Honours Forfeiture Committee is usually kept under wraps but David Cameron told MPs on Wednesday he expected it to sit in the coming days. Political pressure has been mounting for the title awarded to Sir Fred in 2004 for \\"services to banking\\" to be withdrawn over his role in the subsequent collapse of RBS.","completion":"For the first time, a list of individuals who declined royal honours between 1951 and 1999, and have since passed away, has been publicly released. This information, which until now was considered classified and often excluded from official documents under the 30-year rule, was made available following a Freedom of Information request by the BBC. Historically, the public has generally only learned about individuals refusing such honors, which include the OBE, CBE, or knighthood, if the recipients disclosed the information themselves or if such details were leaked. The list includes 277 individuals, among them prominent figures from the art and literary worlds, including painters Francis Bacon and LS Lowry, sculptor Henry Moore, and writers Aldous Huxley and Roald Dahl. Evidently, Lowry declined more honors than anyone else on the list, having refused an OBE in 1955, a CBE in 1961, and a knighthood in 1968. Similarly, Bacon declined a CBE in 1960, while renowned psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud rejected an honor in 1977. Dahl and Aldous Huxley were among several writers who declined these accolades. In the entertainment field, film director Sir Alfred Hitchcock initially declined a CBE in 1962, but later accepted a knighthood from the Queen four months prior to his death in 1980. Notable figures have been known to reject or return honors bestowed upon them by the monarchy. Beatles member John Lennon famously returned his MBE in 1969 in protest against Britain's involvement in certain conflicts, and Joseph Corre, co-founder of lingerie brand Agent Provocateur, rejected the title, criticizing former Prime Minister Tony Blair as \\"morally corrupt\\". The publication of the list provides a new perspective on the traditional honors system, which has often faced criticism for its hierarchical implications. This unveiling occurs concurrently with discussions among senior civil servants about the potential withdrawal of the knighthood of ex-Royal Bank of Scotland boss Sir Fred Goodwin due to his involvement in the bank's collapse.

(AP) — The family of a 10-year-old boy who died on a giant waterslide at a Kanas water park will receive nearly 20 million in settlement payments, according to court documents. The largest payment to Caleb Schwab's family, 14 million, will come from SVV 1 and KC Water Park, two companies associated with the Texas-based water park operator Schlitterbahn, The Kansas City Star (http://bit.ly/2qvFqgb ) reports. The rest of the money will come from the general contractor, the raft manufacturer and a company that consulted on the 17-story \\"Verruckt\\" waterslide that was dubbed the tallest in the world. The waterslide at the park in Kansas City has been closed since Caleb's death on Aug. 7, 2016. The settlements had already been announced, but the amount wasn't disclosed. The Star obtained the court documents after filing motions to intervene. The newspaper argued that the amounts paid by each defendant should be released to ensure those responsible for Caleb's death are held publicly accountable. Caleb's father is Republican Kansas state Rep. Scott Schwab. Attorneys for the family declined to comment to The Star. They said previously in a written statement that the family was \\"determined to hold all those responsible for this tragedy accountable, while doing all they can to ensure this never happens again to another family.\\" Schlitterbahn spokeswoman Winter Prosapio in an email to The Star that Caleb's family and the others affected will \\"forever be in our thoughts and prayers.\\" The company previously announced it would tear down Verruckt once a court allows it, although it remains unclear when that will happen. Verruckt — German for \\"insane\\" — featured multi-person rafts that made a 17-story drop at speeds of up to 70 mph, followed by a surge up a hump and a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. During the ride, Caleb was decapitated, a person familiar with the investigation previously told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly about the boy's death. The two women who took the ride with Caleb suffered serious facial injuries. They have settled their claims against the companies involved in the making of Verruckt. At the time of Caleb's death, Kansas was known for its light regulation of amusement park rides. But last month, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signed off on legislation that beefs up the state's requirements. Rep. Schwab said in March on the floor of the Kansas House that the bill was for \\"the next kid who goes some place in Kansas for a fun weekend.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Verruckt water slide at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City gained notoriety in 2016 after the tragic incident involving the death of 10-year-old Caleb Schwab.

The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the \\"four-thousanders\\". How long has it taken for the Alps to form?","completion":"The formation of the Alps has taken tens of millions of years, involving a complex process of tectonic plate collisions, folding, and uplifting. The process began during the late Mesozoic era, around 100 million years ago, when the African and Eurasian tectonic plates started converging. The main phase of the orogeny (mountain-building event) occurred during the late Eocene to the early Miocene epochs, approximately 35 to 25 million years ago. This collision led to the creation of large-scale folds and thrust faults, causing the Earth's crust to shorten, lift, and crumple. Over time, this deformation led to the uplifting of marine sedimentary rocks, eventually forming the high mountain peaks of the Alps, such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. The process of mountain formation has continued since then, with ongoing tectonic activity and glacial erosion shaping the landscape further. It's important to note that mountain-building events like the one that formed the Alps can be a gradual process, with changes occurring over millions of years and still evolving today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows?, using the article: Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Options: A. gas B. full stomach C. feeling satisfied D. have energy E. bloated","completion":"When selecting the option in line with common sense, we aim to identify the underlying reason that best explains the action in the given scenario. In this case, the scenario is eating just enough when having breakfast. Let's analyze each option and discuss why it could be the common sense choice. A. Gas: Eating breakfast does not necessarily result in gas production. Although consuming certain types of food might cause gas, it is not the primary reason people eat just enough at breakfast. B. Full stomach: A full stomach implies that you have consumed food to the point where your stomach's capacity has reached its limit. While this might make you stop eating, it doesn't sufficiently explain the behavior of eating just enough at breakfast. C. Feeling satisfied: Eating just enough means consuming the right amount of food to meet your needs and enjoying the meal without feeling too full. This option aligns with the concept of satiety - the sensation of feeling satisfied after eating. Feeling satisfied is important not only to meet your dietary requirements but also to promote general wellbeing and enjoyment in life. This option seems to be the most in line with common sense. D. Have energy: While having energy is essential after eating, it is not the sole factor that determines the amount of food you eat during breakfast. Having energy is indeed a result of a balanced meal; however, it is not the immediate explanation for eating just enough. E. Bloated: Eating just enough reduces the chances of experiencing bloating, but it's not the primary reason for eating this way. Bloating is an unpleasant sensation that occurs when the stomach is too full, yet avoiding this feeling doesn't directly explain the behavior of eating just enough at breakfast. Based on the analysis of the options above, the common sense answer to why you eat just enough when eating breakfast is: C. Feeling satisfied This choice reflects the concept of eating the right amount of food to meet your needs and enjoying the meal without overeating or feeling too full. Satisfaction maintains a healthy balance in your diet while promoting overall wellbeing and prevents overeating or undereating. So, feeling satisfied is indeed the key reason behind eating just enough during breakfast."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them.

A player cannot receive an offside penalty for receiving the ball directly from a throw-in, a corner kick, or a goal kick. In these situations the ball has left play and reset all offside statuses. When the defending team takes control of the ball, the offside status of the attackers gets reset. Any attackers who were offside for the last play are now free to interfere with the play without penalty. However, there are some edge cases where it may be unclear whether this has happened. The ref always makes the final call, but these are the general guidelines: If a defender accidentally deflects the ball or it rebounds off her, there is no offside reset. This includes an instinctive reaction to deflect the ball, although this can be a tough ref call. If the defender makes a save to prevent a goal, there is no offside reset. (This prevents offside players from gaining an advantage by waiting at the goal.) The defender must gain control of the ball before the offside player can interfere. (This can be subjective, but the offside player is usually safe if approaching from some distance away.) If a defender runs off the edge of the field due to his own momentum, he still counts as a defender when working out onside and offside positions. An offside player who does not approach the ball can still receive a penalty if she blocks the vision of a defender in a way that impairs her play. Since a rules tweak in 2013, this is the only way an offside player can receive a penalty without coming into contact with a defender or the ball. Gestures and shouting do not violate offside rules, though they may receive a penalty for unsporting conduct.","completion":"In soccer, a player won't get an offside penalty during throw-ins, corner kicks, or goal kicks, but sometimes it's still tricky to decide if a player is offside, so the referee makes the final decision."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question having multiple possible answers in Urdu language.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Bonsai trees, like all trees and plants, react to the change in seasons. If you're keeping a bonsai tree outside, it will have an even stronger reaction to the change in temperature, sunlight, and the amount of rainfall in the region. In some regions there are four distinct seasons, and in others the seasonal changes are more subtle. In any case, understand the way your tree species reacts to the seasons in your region, and let that information guide the way you care for it. Trees lay dormant during the winter; they aren't producing leaves or growing, so they don't use as much nutrition. During this season, watering the tree is about the only care it needs. Avoid trimming it too much, since it won't be able to replace the depleted nutrients until spring. In spring, trees begin using the nutrients they stored during the winter to sprout new leaves and grow. Since your tree is in transition during this time of year, it's a good time to repot the plant (adding extra nutrients to the soil) and begin trimming. Trees continue to grow during the summer, using up the rest of their stored nutrients. Be sure to water yours well during this period of time. In the fall, tree growth slows, and the nutrients begin accumulating again. This is a good time for both trimming and repotting. Your bonsai tree's light needs depends on the species and your climate, but most will thrive in a location that receives morning sun. Turn the tree 90 degrees every few days so all of the tree foliage can receive an equal amount of light. Indoor trees may need a light shade cloth over the window during hot, bright summer months. During the summer, it's fine for the tree to spend the majority of time outside. Bring it inside overnight when temperatures dip below about 40 °F (4 °C). In preparation for the winter, get your tree acclimated to spending more time indoors by moving it inside for a few hours at a time, and increasing the time it spends indoors every day until you bring it inside entirely. Fertilize the tree with a special fertilizer meant to keep bonsai trees healthy. When the soil begins to look dusty or dry, water the bonsai. The exact watering frequency depends on the tree species and the season. You may need to provide a little water every day during the summer, but only water once every few days during cold winter months.","completion":"Bonsai trees are special little trees that change with the seasons. They need different care during winter, spring, summer, and fall. In winter, they rest and don't grow much, so we just need to give them water. In spring, they wake up and start growing, so we can give them new soil and trim them. In summer, they use up their stored food and need lots of water. In fall, they slow down, and it's a good time for trimming and new soil. Bonsai trees like sunlight, especially in the morning. We should turn them a little every few days so all their leaves get light. Indoor trees might need a little shade when it's very bright outside. When it gets cold, start teaching your tree to live inside by bringing it in for a few hours and gradually increasing the time. Remember to give your bonsai tree special food to keep it healthy. Water it when the soil looks dry, but the amount depends on the type of tree and the time of year.

Here's a breakdown of the sentence structure: - \\"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam\\": This is a condition; it means that the following outcome depends on whether or not the con artist can deceive Sam. - \\"he would have gotten a lot of money\\": This is the outcome; the pronoun \\"he\\" represents the con artist, and the sentence explains that should the condition be met, the con artist will secure a considerable sum of money. To sum up, \\"the con artist\\" and \\"he\\" have the same meaning in the given sentence, because \\"he\\" is a pronoun that serves as a direct reference to \\"the con artist.\\" The correct answer to the multi-choice question is option 2).

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What horrendous act was perpetrated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau?\\" Context: \\"In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The horrendous act perpetrated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as mentioned in the context you provided, was sending his own children to a foundling hospital. This act was seen as hypocritical and contradictory to Rousseau's philosophical beliefs, particularly his theory of universal benevolence. In his book, \\"The Social Contract,\\" Rousseau emphasized the importance of developing a social and political system that nurtures the virtues of its citizens. He also argued that humans, in their natural state, were intrinsically good but became corrupted by society. However, his personal action of abandoning his children to a foundling hospital has been criticized and seen as a contradiction to his theories on human nature and morality. Burke, in his \\"Letter to a Member of the National Assembly,\\" used this act to challenge Rousseau's moral character, claiming that his life was filled with \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" and devoid of virtues or good actions. Furthermore, Burke accused Rousseau of being driven by vanity \\"to a degree little short of madness,\\" which influenced his beliefs and actions more than any genuine concern for the welfare of others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What causes Breuer's despair? Movie plot title: When Nietzsche Wept Movie plot: The film opens with the Russian-born novelistâwho eventually became a member of Freud's 'Vienna Circle'-- Lou Andreas-Salome (Katheryn Winnick) who had an unconsummated (Platonic) 'love affair' with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (Armand Assante), and to whom he allegedly proposed in 1882 (although whether her claims are true is very much up for debate) writing a letter to Dr Josef Breuer (Ben Cross), after hearing of his newly developed talking cure (Breuer was a friend of Sigmund Freud (Jamie Elman), who also appears in the story, and one of the influential fathers of psychoanalysis.). The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own. So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must \\"treat\\" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim (played by Michal Yannai), otherwise known as Anna O., a... The answer is:","completion":"The cause of Breuer's despair is his feelings of love for one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim, otherwise known as Anna O. These feelings contribute to his emotional turmoil and make it difficult for him to maintain a professional relationship with his patient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Coming off their impressive road win over the Giants, the Cardinals went home for a Week 8 duel with the Carolina Panthers in a rematch of last year's divisional game. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart got a 6-yard touchdown run. The Cardinals would respond as quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 14-yard touchdown pass to rookie running back LaRod Stephens-Howling. However, Carolina unleashed its fury in the second quarter with Stewart's 10-yard touchdown run, quarterback Jake Delhomme's 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, and defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 13 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals would begin their rally in the third quarter as Warner connected with tight end Ben Patrick on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Panthers would answer in the fourth quarter as kicker John Kasay booted a 35-yard field goal. Arizona tried to come back as running back Tim Hightower got a 1-yard touchdown run, but Carolina would seal the win as Kasay nailed a 31-yard field goal. How many yards were accumulated on the first rushing and first passing touchdown?","completion":"The first rushing touchdown was a 6-yard run by Jonathan Stewart. The first passing touchdown was a 14-yard pass from Kurt Warner to LaRod Stephens-Howling. To find the total yards accumulated on these two touchdowns, you simply add the yards from each touchdown together: 6 yards (rushing touchdown) + 14 yards (passing touchdown) = 20 yards So, a total of 20 yards were accumulated on the first rushing and first passing touchdown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflection to signify its return to the nest to its mate. contains an answer for the question: What animals' flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The animal mentioned in the article whose flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest is the Australian raven. This distinct chattering sound happens when they are in a group, resting, or preening each other while roosting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Does it follow that \\"There are arguements over what age is appropriate for each activity.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does follow that \\"There are arguments over what age is appropriate for each activity.\\" This statement underlines the fact that people often have differing opinions on the appropriate age for various activities, and this applies to numerous aspects of life, including social, legal, cultural, and educational contexts. These differing opinions are often the result of cultural diversity, personal values and beliefs, as well as research and data on human development. One of the main reasons behind these debates is the understanding that human development varies from one individual to another. People mature at different rates, and as such, what may seem appropriate for one individual may not be suitable for another. Moreover, the appropriateness of activities can be influenced by societal norms and expectations, family values, and gender. Cultural factors also play a significant role in determining the appropriate age for certain activities. For instance, rites of passage and religious ceremonies vary across cultures, with different communities having distinct ideas about the age at which particular events should occur. Legal considerations can also contribute to the debate surrounding the appropriate age for certain activities. Driving, drinking alcohol, consensual sexual activities, and voting are all regulated by law and have specific age requirements. These age limits are often the product of research and societal consensus but can still be a source of contention for some who believe the age limits are too high or too low. Educational activities and the age at which children begin schooling likewise influence debates about appropriateness. For example, some argue that introducing academic subjects and structured learning at an earlier age may be beneficial, while others believe that young children should have more opportunities for play and socialization before formal education begins. Another aspect of the debate regarding age appropriateness of activities arises from the notion of mental, emotional, and physical readiness. Activities such as using digital devices or engaging in competitive sports can have a significant impact on an individual's development and well-being. Therefore, determining the appropriate age for engaging in these activities often depends on understanding the potential risks and benefits, as well as individual levels of maturity and physical development. In conclusion, the statement \\"There are arguments over what age is appropriate for each activity\\" is accurate because individuals and societies have varying opinions on when people should be allowed to engage in specific activities. These arguments take into consideration factors such as human development, cultural norms, legal regulations, and the potential consequences of engaging in particular activities. Ultimately, finding the appropriate age for each activity is likely to be an ongoing debate influenced by advances in our understanding of human development, technology, and societal changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In some cases, it is entirely possible for this scenario to be true. For example, if one of the women is the child's mother, another is the child's grandmother, and the third is an aunt, while the man is the child's father, the group could be considered a family unit. Alternatively, the family may consist of individuals who have formed a blended family or have unique relationships that don't fit the traditional family structure (e.g., close family friends or guardians). However, there are also scenarios in which the five individuals walking together may not constitute a single family unit. For instance, they could be part of an extended family or several separate families. Moreover, the five individuals might be part of a larger group consisting of other family members not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Additionally, the term \\"family\\" is not limited to biological or legal relationships but may encompass a broader range of connections, such as close friends or chosen family members. These varying interpretations of what constitutes a family make it difficult to determine with certainty whether the premise is true without further context or information.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.

One day, Roy is caught by one of his marks who seizes his arm and jabs him hard in the chest with the end of a club. Roy manages to walk out of the bar and make it home. While he lays in pain in his bed, he dreams of his first meeting with the man, Mintz, who taught him how to con people. Mintz' advice to Roy, and one of his steadfast rules, was to never take a partner in a con - it can only end in ruin.That night Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Benning), a grifter herself, stops by and they have sex. The next day, Lily shows up at Roy's place and the two have a tense conversation where Roy points out that Lily hasn't contacted him in eight years. The conversation becomes more intense, with Roy feeling great resentment over their falling out. Lily notices that Roy is incredibly ill and feverish and has him taken to a hospital where he's treated for internal bleeding to the injury to his abdomen and lives.Both Lily and Myra visit Roy in the hospital and there is instant animosity between the two.

Please answer the following question: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process, after oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up, involves exhaling carbon dioxide out of the body, as well as the final steps that lead up to it. To provide a detailed explanation, the following stages occur: 1. Carbon dioxide transport: The now-oxygenated blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, from the body's cells back to the lungs. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) in the blood plasma, while the rest is carried either dissolved in the plasma or bound to hemoglobin within red blood cells. 2. Capillaries to alveoli transfer: As the oxygen-rich blood flows through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli, the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the capillaries and into the alveoli. This process occurs due to the concentration gradient, as the amount of carbon dioxide is higher in the capillaries than in the alveoli. 3. Preparing for exhalation: While the carbon dioxide is entering the alveoli, the diaphragm and other muscles involved in inspiration relax. This causes the volume of the thoracic cavity to decrease and increases the pressure inside the lungs. 4. Exhalation: Due to the increased pressure inside the lungs, air carrying carbon dioxide is forced out of the alveoli and travels back up through the bronchioles and bronchi, and finally through the trachea. 5. Exiting the body: The air continues to move upward through the trachea and past the vocal cords in the larynx before making its way to the pharynx. From there, the air exits the body through the nasal and oral cavities as we exhale. This entire process of inhalation, transfer of gases, and exhalation is a continuous, rhythmic cycle that allows the body to maintain a balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide to support cellular respiration and the overall functioning of our body systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) FILE- In this Jan. 30, 2018, file photo, an employee of Aldi, right, takes an application from a job applicant at a JobNewsUSA job fair in Miami Lakes, Fla. On Friday, April 6, the U.S. government issues the March jobs report. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a modest 103,000 jobs in March after several months of bigger gains, though the government's overall jobs report suggests that the labor market remains healthy. The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate remained 4.1 percent, a 17-year low, for a sixth straight month. Average hourly pay ticked up, climbing 2.7 percent compared with a year earlier. Hiring has accelerated since last fall, defying expectations that a shortage of workers would make it harder for companies to fill open positions. Employers have added a healthy average of 211,000 jobs a month in the past six months. Still, hiring in January was revised sharply lower to 176,000, while February's figure was revised higher to a blockbuster 326,000. Overall, the revisions lowered job gains in those two months by 50,000. The U.S. economy appears fundamentally healthy, with the recovery from the 2008-2009 Great Recession now the second-longest expansion since the 1850s, when economists began tracking recessions and recoveries. Still, the expansion has been puzzlingly slow, with economic growth averaging just 2.2 percent a year — about a percentage point below the historical average. But its durability has been broadly beneficial. For example, a rising number of working-age Americans have begun looking for a job and finding one, reversing a trend from the first few years after the recession when many of the unemployed grew discouraged and stopped looking for work. An increasing need to compete for workers may also finally be lifting wages in some sectors. Still, the steady influx of new workers, which gives employers more hiring options than the low unemployment rate might otherwise suggest, may be holding back overall pay growth. Though the economy likely slowed in the first three months of this year, the healthy pace of hiring indicates that employers anticipate solid customer demand for the rest of the year. Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm, forecasts that the economy grew at just a 1.4 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter — less than half the 2.9 percent annual pace of the October-December quarter. But the firm expects growth to rebound to a decent 3.1 percent annual pace in the current April-June quarter. Other reports indicate that growing optimism among businesses and consumers should help propel the economy in the months ahead. Businesses have stepped up their spending on manufactured goods, helping lift factory output. And last month, factories expanded at a healthy pace after having grown in February at the fastest rate since 2004, according to a private survey. Government data showed that orders for long-lasting factory goods — including industrial machinery, metals and autos — surged in February. Americans have spent less at retail chains in the past two months, after shopping at a healthy pace during the winter holiday season. With consumer confidence near the highest point in two decades, however, consumer spending is likely to rebound in the coming months. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Even though the US stock market started off a bit low because the US and China are not getting along well in their trade deals, overall, things are still looking pretty good for jobs in the US.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is possible to start finding pathways to letting others help you. One of the best ways of doing this is to follow your first mind. The minute you have a conscious thought that you are facing something you cannot alone handle, seek out help. Don't take the time to talk yourself out of it. Remember to make a note of the solution you receive for your problem. This will help you when you face a similar situation again When the thought crosses your mind that you could do with help sorting out a problem - carrying a heavy box, making dinner, working out a work dilemma, etc. - act on it. Decide who you will ask, phrase the request in your head, and go and ask for help. If another person is being kind in offering help, accepting it at face value is the first step. Yes, there are people with bad intentions, but there are also those who want to do good by others. Look for those people in the world and stop focusing on the negative. Seek out the goodness in others and restore your faith in humanity. An easy way to do this is by volunteering. Watching others give of themselves selflessly to assist those who are less fortunate is a terrific way to recognize the good in people. Volunteering also helps you to notice how people depend on one another within a community, and how all parts must work together to function as a whole. Choose wisely and carefully. Avoid people who make you feel like a lesser person in any way. Find people you really trust to try out asking for help first. This will allow you to open up bit by bit, and not be exposed to someone who might not do the right thing by you, or who might purposely make you feel weak for asking. In order to get, you need to give. If you keep cutting yourself off from opening up to others, you risk not sharing your skills, talents, and abilities with others in need of help. In helping another person, you cease to focus on yourself. And when you cease to focus on yourself, it is far easier to accept support back from another. In giving of yourself (your time, your listening ear, your love, your care, etc.), you are helping another learn more about you, be able to care for you, and believe that you will reciprocate the attention that they bestow upon you. Beyond receiving anything in return, giving also promotes cooperation, strengthens bonds, boosts feelings of gratitude, and is just downright good for your health. . In order to receive help, you need to trust the other person and to trust that you're worthy of help (self-respect). This might be the hardest part but it is absolutely vital. Wholesome, accepting, self-assured trust is capable of absorbing rejection, attracting genuine help, and will easily detect the occasional exploitative person. Choosing to trust requires that you: modify your expectations - remember that people are only human and they have both good and bad traits (so do you!) recognize that disappointment, fear, abandonment, and rejection are possible in all relationships find yourself worthy and capable of making wise decisions and being around decent people It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain. A problem is a problem, whatever its ease or difficulty. The litmus test is how much it is impacting you negatively and preventing you from moving forward. Belittling your problem as not worthy of being solved only serves to make it even more challenging to cope with. of the problems that no one can fix. There lies the greatest strength of all as there is a big difference between \\"burying\\" problems in comparison to accepting, forgiving and letting them go. If you need help to do that, really don't be afraid to ask for it.

You are presented with the question \\"what will plants die without?\\" and the following answer choices: - acid - energy - phosphorous - pollution - oxygen - photons - water - rain Now knowing that animals require water for survival and if water is scarce, animals and plants die, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"water. Water is an essential component for plant survival. It plays a critical role in various physiological processes and biochemical reactions that take place within the plant system. Let's explore the importance of water for plants and why it is the best answer choice in this case. 1. Photosynthesis: Water is a vital component in the process of photosynthesis, wherein plants use sunlight to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. The glucose produced is used as an energy source for growth and maintenance of plant cells, while oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. 2. Nutrient absorption and transportation: Water helps in dissolving essential nutrients and minerals that are found in the soil. The plant roots absorb these nutrients, which are then transported to different parts of the plant via the vascular system. Thus, without water, plants cannot effectively absorb and assimilate nutrients required for their growth and development. 3. Turgor pressure and structural stability: Water is responsible for maintaining turgor pressure in plant cells. This pressure, caused by the presence of water in cells, gives the plant its rigidity and structure. Without water, the cells would lose their turgidity, causing the plant to wilt and eventually die. 4. Transpiration and cooling: As water evaporates through small openings called stomata, mainly present on leaves, the process of transpiration occurs. Transpiration plays a vital role in the uptake of water and nutrients from the roots while also cooling the plant in hot conditions. Lack of water can result in inadequate cooling and lead to heat stress, negatively impacting the plant's overall health. 5. Cell division and growth: Water is required for various cellular processes, including cell division and elongation, which contribute to plant growth. Without water, these cellular processes would not occur efficiently, leading to stunted growth and eventual death. Out of all the answer choices provided, water is the most crucial factor for plant survival. While other factors such as energy (in the form of light), oxygen, and essential nutrients like phosphorus are also necessary, these would be of little use if the plant does not have access to water. The presence of water ensures that plants can carry out essential processes such as photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, structural support, and other critical functions which enable them to thrive and survive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The decision follows a series of allegations about potential election fraud, which has led to concerns among various factions of the political spectrum. This move is not only unprecedented in the history of Taiwan's democracy, but also highlights the significance of ensuring the integrity of the voting system and safeguarding the will of the electorate. The controversy began to unfold as several politicians and their supporters voiced concerns about the possibility of vote manipulation during recent elections. In response, numerous individuals and political parties called for the recount of votes, claiming that discrepancies in the tallies could potentially have influenced the outcome. Given the tense political climate in Taiwan, the court's decision to seal the ballot boxes aims to prevent further tampering and guarantee the transparency of the electoral process. Such a move by the Taiwanese court is viewed by some as a response to safeguarding democracy and ensuring a fair and honest election. By sealing the ballot boxes, the court aims to eliminate any potential interference before the official recount can be conducted. This measure is meant to guarantee the integrity of the final vote totals and prevent future disputes regarding the election's legitimacy. As the recount process is set to begin, it is crucial to recognize that this is not simply a matter of resolving political disputes or determining the election's ultimate outcome. Rather, the situation in Taiwan highlights the increasingly pressing need to safeguard the principles of democracy, transparency, and accountability in electoral affairs. By addressing the concerns raised regarding election tampering and irregularities, Taiwan is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring the highest standards in its democratic processes. The court's order to seal the ballot boxes also serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by democracies around the world. In an era of technological advancements and increasing globalization, maintaining the integrity of electoral systems has become more critical than ever. With reports of election interference, cyber attacks, and vote tampering becoming all too common, governments and electoral bodies must remain vigilant and proactive in their efforts to protect the sanctity of the voting process. As Taiwan embarks on the journey to recount the votes and ultimately determine the genuine outcome of its recent elections, the weight of this responsibility cannot be underestimated. Ensuring that every vote is counted and validated accurately is essential not only for the political stability of Taiwan but also for the broader democratic values it upholds. In conclusion, the Taiwanese court's decision to seal the ballot boxes in response to demands for a recount serves as a testament to the nation's commitment to upholding the principles of democracy, transparency, and the rule of law. It underscores the vital importance of maintaining electoral integrity and ensuring the people's will is accurately reflected in the final results. As the world continues to navigate the complexities of democratic governance, countries like Taiwan must remain steadfast in their pursuit of electoral justice, setting an example for others to follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a press conference prior to the 2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison. Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same. \\"I was wrong for using that stuff\\", he told USA Today. \\"What we should have done a long time ago was stand up--players, ownership, everybody--and said, 'We made a mistake.'\\" When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: \\"Maybe one day I'll talk about it, but not now.\\" Giambi did speak with George J.

The two-time Cy Young winner's autopsy report was released Friday. A cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma with drowning as a contributing factor. While Halladay only had a BAC of .01, the New York Daily News reports he had surpassed the level of Ambien in his system that the FDA finds is \\"capable of impairing driving to a degree that increases the risk of a motor vehicle accident.\\" FAA regulations forbid the use of alcohol eight hours before flying or \\"any drug that affects the person's faculties in any way contrary to safety.\\" \\"The drugs are particularly important in the assessment of the impairment of Mr. Halladay while operating the plane,\\" Dr. Bruce Goldberger at University of Florida Health Forensic Medicine tells the Tampa Bay Times. \\"The [National Transportation Safety Board] will take this evidence under consideration during their investigation of this accident.\\" However, the presence of drugs in Halladay's system is not a confirmation he was flying his personal plane while impaired, Goldberger cautions. Halladay died after crashing his sport plane off the coast of Florida. The 40-year-old was the only person in the aircraft. Halladay spent 16 years as a professional pitcher with the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies. He retired in 2013. Article:","completion":"Title: Remembering Roy Halladay and Learning About Plane Safety Once upon a time, there was a famous baseball player named Roy Halladay. He was a very good pitcher and he played with teams called the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies. Pitchers are the players who throw the ball to the person holding the bat, called the batter. Roy Halladay was so good at playing baseball that he won awards and many people loved watching him play. But one day, something sad happened. Roy Halladay was flying a small plane over the big ocean called the Gulf of Mexico when his plane crashed into the water. He got hurt pretty badly, and he couldn't swim to safety. Sadly, Roy Halladay passed away. That means he didn't survive and won't be able to play baseball or fly planes anymore. After the accident, some people who are good at understanding what happens in crashes, like scientists and doctors, looked at Roy Halladay's body and the plane to find out what might have caused the accident. They discovered that he had taken some medicines and a little bit of alcohol before flying his plane. The people who make rules for flying say that pilots should not drink alcohol or take certain medicines before they fly. This is important because these things can make people feel very sleepy or not able to think clearly when they need to make quick decisions or be very careful. One of the doctors, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, told a newspaper called the Tampa Bay Times that the medicines found in Roy Halladay's body could have made it difficult for him to fly the plane safely. However, Dr. Goldberger also said that just because these medicines were in his body doesn't mean they caused the crash. The people who investigate accidents will look at other things too, like the plane itself and the weather on that day. They will help us understand what can be done to keep pilots safe so that accidents like this don't happen again. Even though Roy Halladay's death is sad, it can teach us a lot about safety when flying planes and the importance of following rules, especially when it comes to taking care of our bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album.

Would \\"By most definitions, characters do not strictly require actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although terms such as costumed crime fighters or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to those such as Batman and Green Arrow without such powers who share other common superhero traits.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: [1]. No; [2]. Yes; Answer:","completion":"[2]. Yes; Step 1: Understanding the Task - The task is twofold with the first being \\"Identify the source of a superhero's powers\\" and the second being \\"Check if the given statement is a reasonable answer to the first task\\". Step 2: Addressing the First Task - \\"The source of a superhero's powers\\" generally varies depending on the narrative of the character. It could come from a variety of sources such as genetic mutation (e.g. X-Men), technological advancement (e.g. Iron Man), magical or mystical artifacts (e.g. Thor), or rigorous training and vast resources (e.g. Batman). Step 3: Addressing the Second Task - The statement provided is referring to superheroes such as Batman and Green Arrow, who, despite not having superhuman powers, are considered superheroes due to their other shared common superhero traits. This suggests that superhuman powers are not the sole basis for defining a superhero but other factors can equate to the term \\"superhero\\". Conclusion: The answer is \\"Yes\\", because the statement reasonably answers the question about the source of a superhero's powers by stating that superhuman abilities are not the only defining factor for a superhero. Clear examples are given of superheroes without such powers, reinforcing the point. This supports the idea that superheroes can be defined by other traits such as their commitment to fight crime or their exceptional skills and resources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I got my food and joined them, and the criminal, who had moments before been so scary, took his seat beside me and told us many funny jokes. A table of adults surrounded me, but I was never uncomfortable talking with strangers. I worked with these people and they worked with me. We talked, we laughed, we got to know each other and sometimes we became friends. At the end of the day we all went our separate ways, but we had been drawn close by working together to make this play. After the show was broadcast, my friends asked if I had been scared of the criminal. At first this sounded funny. He was, after all, a kind and intelligent man.

Andy researched more about carbon dioxide, while Ben researched methane gas. Which researcher studied more about the use of fossil fuels? Answer:","completion":"Andy, who researched more about carbon dioxide, studied more about the use of fossil fuels. This is because the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Fossil fuels are widely used in various sectors, including transportation, electricity generation, and industrial processes. When fossil fuels are burned, they release significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This occurs because the carbon that was stored in the fuels over millions of years is now being released as CO2 during combustion. In fact, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), fossil fuel combustion accounted for approximately 74% of total U.S. CO2 emissions in 2019. This makes it one of the primary contributors to the greenhouse effect and subsequent climate change. On the other hand, Ben researched methane gas, which is another important greenhouse gas. While methane is not necessarily directly linked to the burning of fossil fuels, it can be associated with some fossil fuel-related activities. Methane is emitted during the production, processing, storage, transmission, and distribution of fossil fuels like natural gas, coal, and petroleum. The decomposition of organic waste in landfills and the digestive processes of livestock also release methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, much stronger than carbon dioxide in terms of trapping heat in the atmosphere. However, it has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, which makes its overall contribution to climate change lesser than that of carbon dioxide. In summary, it is Andy who studied more about the use of fossil fuels by focusing on carbon dioxide emissions, as fossil fuel combustion represents one of the major sources of CO2, adding to the greenhouse effect and climate change. While Ben's research on methane gas is also crucial in understanding its role in global warming, it does not exclusively revolve around the use of fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Summarize this article: It is important to know how FIV is spread so that you can keep your FIV-free cats healthy and make sure that your FIV-positive cat still has a happy life. FIV is most commonly spread through a cat’s saliva, though it can also be spread through blood and semen. The most common way for a cat to contract FIV is through getting bit by an FIV-positive cat. Keep in mind that FIV is a relatively fragile virus that cannot survive in the environment beyond a few seconds. Outside the body, FIV is rapidly damaged by drying, UV, heat, light and basic disinfectants, and poses no risk to other cats. The virus requires direct transmission from infected saliva of one cat, into the bloodstream of a healthy cat. Studies have shown that it is not absolutely necessary to keep your healthy cats separate from your FIV-positive cats if they get along well. If your cats have a tendency to fight, however, it is a good idea to keep them separate. In studies done by the University of Glasgow, it was found that when FIV-free and FIV-positive cats were around each other, there was a 1-2% transmission rate. You will have to decide whether that 1 to 2% is too much of a risk to take. When cats get spayed (females) or neutered (males), they become less aggressive, which means that the chances that they will get into fights is greatly reduced. If you have an FIV-positive cat that you want to remain an outdoor cat, it is a good idea to get it fixed so that it is less likely to bite another cat in a fight. As a responsible cat owner, your priorities should be to keep your FIV-positive cat healthy, and to make sure that it does not infect any other cats. Male cats tend to roam over large distances, sometimes across several acres and are likely to encounter other cats on their travels. If he is likely to scrap with these cats, then it is essential to keep him indoors. Keeping a territorial cat indoors might not be the most ideal situation, particularly if he is used to roaming around outside, but it might be the only way to keep him from spreading FIV to other cats in your neighborhood. If you live in a city, it is a good idea to talk to a local veterinarian about the incidence of FIV in the area. If there is a large population of feral cats who are FIV-positive, you may want to keep FIV-free cats indoors but may feel alright about letting your FIV-positive cat stay an outdoor cat. If FIV is rare in a high cat density neighborhood, then, as a responsible owner, you should keep your FIV-positive pet indoors. If you live in an area with a low population of cats, such as remote countryside, then the risk of cats meeting and fighting is low, and it is acceptable to let your FIV-positive cat out. Summary:","completion":"FIV is a virus that can make cats sick, and it spreads mostly through saliva when cats bite each other. It's important to protect healthy cats from FIV, but the virus can't live for long outside the body. If your cats get along well, they can stay together even if one has FIV. But if they fight, it's better to keep them separate. Fixing cats can make them less likely to fight. If you have an FIV-positive cat, try to keep it from spreading the virus to other cats outdoors by either keeping it inside or getting it fixed. Talk to your vet about the risk of FIV in your area, and decide what's best for your cats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Paul Newman Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM England are perfectly placed to end close to a year of abject misery by finishing off a job they have started with four highly impressive days at the Ageas Bowl and level this Investec series with victory in the third Test. A win that would be absolutely priceless for England will be sealed if they can take the remaining six Indian wickets and complete what has been up to now one of the most important and satisfying performances of Alastair Cook’s career. One of the most successful England teams in modern memory have completely and spectacularly unravelled since that golden afternoon in Durham almost 12 months ago when Stuart Broad propelled them to a decisive 3-0 Ashes lead. Then OPTIONS: - Ageas Bowl, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Alastair Cook, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Ali, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Cook, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Durham, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - England, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Gary Ballance, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - India, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Indian, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Investec, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - James Anderson, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Joe Root, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Lord's, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Murali Vijay, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Paul Newman, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Paul_NewmanDM, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Root, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. - Stuart Broad, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded.","completion":"Alastair Cook, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. This strategic decision by the captain turned out to be a masterstroke, as Moeen Ali went on to take crucial wickets, dismantling the Indian batting lineup and giving his team a significant advantage in the match. The previously struggling England team suddenly appeared reenergized and inspired, playing with a newfound aggression and enthusiasm. The bowlers relentlessly attacked the Indian batsmen, and the fielders supported their efforts with outstanding athleticism and determination. It was beginning to look like a classic England performance, reminiscent of their all-conquering days just a year ago. In the face of such a spirited onslaught, the Indian batsmen simply crumbled under pressure. One after another, they succumbed to the skill and guile of the English bowlers, much to the delight of the home crowd. The atmosphere at the Ageas Bowl was electric, as the fans began to sense that they were witnessing the revival of their beloved team. As the shadows lengthened on the fourth day, England inched ever closer to their ultimate goal. The Indian lower order managed to put up a brief fight, but it was ultimately futile, as they too were unable to resist the relentless English assault. The final Indian wicket fell just before the close of play, sealing a truly remarkable victory for the hosts and cementing their position as one of the most successful England teams in modern memory. Alastair Cook's England had achieved the seemingly impossible, coming back from the brink of despair to triumph in the third Test and level the series. The taste of victory was sweeter than ever, as the players celebrated with their fans and allowed themselves to dream once more of even greater glories to come. This decisive win marked the beginning of a new chapter in England cricket, one filled with hope, determination, and the belief that they could once again reach the pinnacle of the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Czech is a West Slavic language that is most predominantly spoken in the Czech Republic and is closely related to Polish, Slovak, and Sorbian languages. In this specific phrase, \\"ano\\" translates to \\"yes\\" or \\"indeed,\\" and \\"pane\\" is a polite address for a man, similar to \\"sir\\" or \\"mister\\" in English. The Czech language has a complex grammar system and uses cases, which means that the endings of words change based on their function within a sentence. There are seven cases in Czech, and each case is associated with a different role in the sentence, such as the subject, object, or other modifiers. As in other Slavic languages, Czech also has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. These intricacies make the Czech language both highly expressive and challenging for non-native speakers to learn. Czech orthography uses the Latin alphabet with several specific diacritical marks added to represent distinct sounds, such as the hacek (little hook) placed above certain letters like 'ř' or 'š,' or the acute accent used on vowels to indicate length, like 'á' or 'é.' Czech has a rich literary history as well. Renowned authors like Jaroslav Hašek, Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Karel Čapek have contributed significantly to world literature through their works written in or translated from Czech. Furthermore, the Czech language has an essential role in Slavic studies and linguistics, as well as being a central part of the cultural identity of the Czech people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Each year, this butterfly travels about 3000miles to its winter home in central Mexico . How can it fly so far? And why does it make this long and dangerous trip? Scientists still don't have an answer. For many years, people in Mexico wondered where the orange-and-black butterflies came from every winter. Then, in 1937, a scientist started to follow and study the butterflies. For the next 20 years, he discovered that one butterfly started its journey in Canada. Four months later, it arrived in Mexico. The length of the butterflies find their way back to the same place? Another amazing thing is that the butterflies always return to the same area in central Mexico. How do the butterflies find their way back to the same place? This is an interesting question because only every fourth generation makes the trip south. In other words, the butterfly that travels to Mexico this year is the great-great-grandchild of the butterfly that traveled there last year. Each year, four generations of a Monarch butterfly family are born. Each generation of the family has a very different life. The first generation is born in the south in late April. It slowly moves north, reproduces , and then dies. On the trip north,two more generations are born, reproduce, and die. Each of these generations of butterflies is born. This generation has a much longer life. It lives for about eight months. This generation of butterflies makes the amazing journey back to the winter home of its great-great-grandparents. The butterflies spend the winter there, and in the spring they reproduce and then die. Their offspring will be the first generation of the next circle of life. Today, people are still studying the Monarch butterfly. But they are not clear about everything.

(3). no.","completion":"Let's analyze the given sentences step by step: 1. Understand the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1 states that Scafel, Great Gable, Pillar, and Kirk Fell are challenging and exciting even for professionals. Sentence 2 states that Scafel is not very challenging. 2. Identify the relationship between the two statements. If Sentence 1 is true, then Scafel should be challenging and exciting for professionals. According to Sentence 2, Scafel is not very challenging. 3. Compare the two statements. Since Sentence 1 implies that Scafel is a challenging and exciting mountain for professionals, Sentence 2, which claims Scafel isn't very challenging, appears to contradict Sentence 1. 4. Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. If the first sentence (Sentence 1) is true, then the second sentence (Sentence 2) cannot be true because it contradicts the information in Sentence 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (3) no. Sentence 2 cannot be true if Sentence 1 is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people whose employers forbid them from creating a human-animal hybrid? Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In preparation for sending a manned rocket into space, American scientists Dr. Quent Brady and Dan Morgan are put in charge of a program that sends various animals and insects into space to test their survival rates. After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate. In Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz' hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell.

Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over.

The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank. Tests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The \\"B\\" could stand for \\"brain\\", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin is sunflower seeds. Even when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Options: * negative. * positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? remain an unchanged dullard","completion":"The phrase \\"remain an unchanged dullard\\" can be considered negative for several reasons. Here is a detailed breakdown of the phrase and the reasons for its negative connotation: 1. Language used: The word \\"dullard\\" is a derogatory term used to describe someone who is slow to learn or lacking in intellectual capacity. It often carries a strong negative connotation and can be insulting in nature when directed at an individual. This term, being pejorative, makes the phrase negative. 2. Implied stagnation: The phrase implies the subject is remaining the same as they are currently, with no prospects of change or improvement. In this case, the subject is being referred to as a dullard, suggesting that they will continue to be regarded as such in the future. The idea of stagnation and not being able to grow or change is generally associated with a negative perspective. 3. Lack of growth or development: Human beings are generally encouraged to strive for personal growth and development, both intellectually and otherwise. In describing someone as remaining an unchanged dullard, the phrase suggests that they are not experiencing any kind of personal growth. This lack of forward movement in one's life is considered undesirable and is often seen as a negative attribute. 4. Dismissal of potential: Implicit in this phrase is the assumption that the individual referred to as a dullard does not possess the potential for improvement or change. This perspective can be disempowering and limiting, as it does not acknowledge the possibility that the person in question could grow, develop, and change for the better. Such a dismissal of potential is generally considered negative. 5. Context and tone: The phrase \\"remain an unchanged dullard\\" is likely to be utilized in a context where the speaker is expressing dissatisfaction, criticism, or disappointment with the person being described. Such contexts and the concomitant tone that accompanies them tend to carry a negative sentiment, further contributing to the negative nature of the phrase. In conclusion, the phrase \\"remain an unchanged dullard\\" is predominantly negative due to the use of derogatory language, the implications of stagnation, lack of growth, dismissal of potential, and the context in which it's likely to be used. The criticism is directed at the individual's intellectual abilities and their lack of improvement, which is generally seen as undesired and unfavorable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which form the Ohio River, Pittsburgh is known as both \\"the Steel City\\" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, and as the \\"City of Bridges\\" for its 446 bridges. The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclines, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest. The mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders. - The United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) was the largest branch of Presbyterianism in the United States from May 28, 1958 to 1983. It was formed by the union of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), often referred to (inaccurately) as the \\"Northern\\" Presbyterian Church, with the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA), a smaller church of Covenanter-Seceder tradition at a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May 1958. Vigorous ecumenical activity on the part of PCUSA leaders led to this merger, something of a reunion of two long-separated branches of the larger Presbyterian family deriving from the British Isles. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to Scotland. - The United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA) was an American Presbyterian denomination that existed for one hundred years. It was formed on May 26, 1858 by the union of the Northern branch of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (Covenanter and Seceder) with the Associate Presbyterian Church (Seceders) at a convention at the Old City Hall in Pittsburgh. On May 28, 1958, it merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) at a conference in Pittsburgh to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA). - Presbyter (Greek , : \\"elder\\" or \\"priest\\" in Christian usage) in the New Testament refers to a leader in local Christian congregations, with presbyter being from the Greek \\"\\"presbyteros\\"\\" and meaning elder/senior and episkopos meaning overseer, referring exclusively to the office of bishop, but with presbyteros being understood by many as referring to the same person functioning as overseer. In modern Catholic and Orthodox usage, presbyter is distinct from \\"bishop\\" and synonymous with \\"priest\\". However, in predominant Protestant usage, the term is not seen as referring to a member of a distinctive priesthood called \\"priests,\\" but instead terms such as \\"minister\\", \\"pastor\\" and \\"elder\\" are used. - The Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS, originally Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America) was a Protestant Christian denomination in the Southern and border states of the United States that existed from 1861 to 1983. That year it merged with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) to form the Presbyterian Church (USA). - The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America ( PCUSA ) was the first national Presbyterian denomination in the United States , existing from 1789 to 1958 . In 1958 , the PCUSA merged with the United Presbyterian Church of North America , a denomination with roots in the Seceder and Covenanter traditions of Presbyterianism . The new church was named the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . It was a predecessor to the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) . The denomination had its origins in colonial times when members of the Church of Scotland and Presbyterians from Ireland first immigrated to America . After the American Revolution , the PCUSA was organized in Philadelphia under the leadership of John Witherspoon to provide national leadership for Presbyterians in the new nation . In 1861 , Presbyterians in the Southern United States split from the denomination because of disputes over slavery , politics , and theology precipitated by the American Civil War . The Southern churches established the Presbyterian Church in the United States , often simply referred to as the \`\` Southern Presbyterians '' . Due to its regional identification , the PCUSA was commonly described as the Northern Presbyterian Church . Despite the PCUSA 's designation as a \`\` Northern church '' , it was once again a national denomination in its later years . The church 's doctrines and practices were more ecumenical and less committed to traditional Calvinism , having been influenced by Arminian beliefs early in the 19th century , liberal theology late in the 19th century , and neo-orthodoxy by the mid- 20th century . The theological tensions within the denomination were played out in the Fundamentalist -- Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s , a conflict that led to the development of Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism . Conservatives dissatisfied with liberal trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936 . - The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARPC), as it exists today, is the remnant of a small denomination, which was formed from the Synod of the South, a division of the Associate Reformed Church. The original Associate Reformed Church resulted from a merger of the Associate Presbytery (from the Seceder tradition of the 18th century) and most of the Reformed Presbytery (from the Covenanter tradition of the 17th century) in Philadelphia in 1782. It is one of the oldest of the United States' theologically and socially conservative denominations. - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - The Presbyterian Church (USA), or PC(USA), is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination in the United States. A part of the Reformed tradition, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the U.S., and known for its relatively progressive stance on doctrine. The PC(USA) was established by the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state.

St Albans School head Jonathan Gillespie thanked rescuers but said the alarm was raised when two of the party began to feel unwell. Three mountain rescue teams, police, a coastguard helicopter and the ambulance service were involved in the search for the school children reportedly lost in low cloud around Llyn y Fan Fach, near Abercraf. More on this and other stories from Hertfordshire Forty-seven pupils aged 15 and 16, were divided into groups on the second day of a three-day silver Duke of Edinburgh award expedition when two of them began to feel unwell, Mr Gillespie said. They were part of a small group of seven who correctly followed their training procedures and called for help, he said. School staff were able to give rescuers a grid location for the group, who were found and led down the mountain. Three other groups were later located and rescuers confirmed all 26 children were safe. They were taken to a hospital to be checked as a precaution. The pupils' attempts to make their own way down the mountain had been hampered by heavy rain, strong winds and a negligible mobile phone signal, emergency services said.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented. The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse. In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \\"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change. The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 \\"thumbs down\\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days. Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \\"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\\" and \\"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system\\".

Given the question: Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \\"biting their lip\\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \\"bite your lip.\\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \\"pardon my French\\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset. Who is this passage most likely written for? A) All kinds of people B) Young children C) Very angry people D) People who like to swear The answer is:","completion":"A) All kinds of people Step-by-step justification: 1. The passage discusses the concept of expressing and controlling anger, which is a universal emotion that people of all ages and backgrounds experience. 2. It suggests various ways to cope with anger, such as counting to 10, biting one's lip, or finding a safe space to release frustration, which can be applied by everyone regardless of their specific anger levels. 3. The passage also talks about apologizing when using bad language and explaining the reasons for one's anger. This advice is useful for people in general, as everyone might occasionally use inappropriate language in a moment of anger. 4. The passage does not exclusively focus on or target people such as young children, very angry people, or those who like to swear. Rather, it offers helpful advice for managing anger that can be relevant to a wide range of individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specificationsall of them free open standardsdefine XML. - Query languages are computer languages used to make queries in databases and information systems. - The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3). - XPath 2.0 is a version of the XPath language defined by the World Wide Web Consortium , W3C . It became a recommendation on 23 January 2007 . As a W3C Recommendation it was superseded by XPath 3.0 on 10 April 2014 . XPath is used primarily for selecting parts of an XML document . For this purpose the XML document is modelled as a tree of nodes . XPath allows nodes to be selected by means of a hierarchic navigation path through the document tree . The language is significantly larger than its predecessor , XPath 1.0 , and some of the basic concepts such as the data model and type system have changed . The two language versions are therefore described in separate articles . XPath 2.0 is used as a sublanguage of XSLT 2.0 , and it is also a subset of XQuery 1.0 . All three languages share the same data model ( the XDM ) , type system , and function library , and were developed together and published on the same day . - A standards organization, standards body, standards developing organization (SDO), or standards setting organization (SSO) is an organization whose primary activities are developing, coordinating, promulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise producing technical standards that are intended to address the needs of a group of affected adopters. - XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document. In addition, XPath may be used to compute values (e.g., strings, numbers, or Boolean values) from the content of an XML document. XPath was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\"?

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich? As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. Answer:","completion":"The three people observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich are Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Problem:Background Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among young children in developing countries. Information on the incidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) infections in developing countries, especially among rural children, is very limited. Objectives This study was conducted to identify whether these viruses were associated with ARTI among children B5 years of age in rural and peri-urban populations in South India. Methods The study was cross-sectional with prospective sample collection. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children B5 years of age presenting with ARTI. None of the children in this study were known to have any immunosuppressive conditions. The two viruses, hMPV and HBoV, were identified using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and one-step PCR assays, respectively. The lower limits of detection of hMPV and HBoV were 6.69 9 10 5 plasmid copies and 5.77 9 10 3 plasmid copies, respectively, per 5 lL PCR reaction input. Results The frequency of hMPV infection in children was higher than that of HBoV infection. The different frequencies of hMPV in patients in various age groups with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were compared, and the variance was found to be insignificant. In the 38 children who were hMPV positive, the majority (73.7 %) were from rural communities. The overall hMPVpositive rate was higher in the rural population than in the peri-urban population, but the difference was statistically insignificant. The youngest age at which hMPV-positive status was recorded was 5 months. Conclusion This study demonstrated that hMPV was associated with a significant number (i.e.[10 %) of ARTIs in children in South India, whereas a relatively smaller number of HBoV infections was observed.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"pressure in what is highest in arteries and lowest in veins?\\" and the following answer choices: - Joules - Decibels - It decreases - protein walls - skin tags - forces - vessel walls - cell walls Now knowing that blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins and what is Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the pressure on the blood vessel walls, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"pressure in what is highest in arteries and lowest in veins?\\" is \\"vessel walls.\\" This is because blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted on the blood vessel walls due to the circulation of blood through the cardiovascular system. Blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins due to the properties of the circulatory system and the nature of blood flow. Arteries are responsible for transporting oxygen-rich blood away from the heart and distributing it throughout the body. The arterial walls are thick and muscular to withstand the pressure exerted by the blood as it is pumped out of the heart. Due to their elastic properties, they can expand and contract with each heartbeat, helping to maintain and regulate blood pressure. After oxygen and nutrients have been exchanged at the capillaries, blood flows into the veins, which are responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Veins have thinner walls and larger internal diameters compared to arteries, as the blood pressure in veins is significantly lower. The lower pressure in veins can be attributed to the blood losing energy as it flows through the capillary beds and encountering resistance from blood vessel walls. Veins also contain valves that prevent backflow, ensuring that the blood flows in one direction towards the heart. The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the movement of surrounding muscles, which help to squeeze and push the blood through the veins. Gravity also plays a role in returning blood to the heart when standing or sitting upright. In summary, the best answer to the question is \\"vessel walls\\" as blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins due to the pressure exerted on the blood vessel walls by the circulating blood. This pressure is influenced by the structure and properties of the vessels, as well as the mechanisms employed to facilitate blood flow through the cardiovascular system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars.

The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left.

Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. Guess a valid title for it!

Question: \\"In his autobiography \\"\\"Life\\"\\", what does Keith Richards say is his nickname for Mick Jagger?\\" Answer:","completion":"In his autobiography \\"Life,\\" Keith Richards, the legendary guitarist of The Rolling Stones, reveals that his nickname for the band's lead singer Mick Jagger is \\"Brenda\\" or \\"Her Majesty.\\" The book, released in 2010, offers an intimate look into the lives and relationships of the iconic rock band members, including the turbulent and often complex friendship between Richards and Jagger that has spanned more than half a century. The nickname \\"Brenda\\" is said to be inspired by a British upper-class, feminine name. This moniker pokes fun at Jagger's supposed inflated sense of self-importance and tendency to take himself too seriously. It is reported that Keith Richards and other members of the band began calling Jagger by this nickname in private to take him down a peg, highlighting the tensions and resentment that would sometimes emerge between the two prolific musicians. \\"Her Majesty\\" is another nickname Richards uses for Jagger, and it stems from the same intent as \\"Brenda.\\" By likening Jagger to a queen or a royal, Richards insinuates that his bandmate has an exaggerated sense of self-worth and perhaps acts in a dictatorial or controlling manner within the group dynamics. This nickname also provides insight into Richards' irreverent sense of humor and his habit of mocking authority figures. Throughout \\"Life,\\" Richards details their long-lasting friendship and creative partnership, acknowledging Jagger's immense talent and their shared love for music. However, the book also delves into the numerous disagreements, drug-fueled escapades, and personal betrayals that have characterized their tumultuous relationship over the years. The use of these nicknames is emblematic of the underlying tension and rivalry between the two band members. Despite their rocky relationship at times, both Richards and Jagger have managed to remain integral parts of The Rolling Stones for decades. The band has weathered various storms and challenges, including addiction, infighting, and legal troubles, to become one of the most iconic and enduring rock bands in history. In conclusion, Keith Richards' nicknames for Mick Jagger, \\"Brenda\\" and \\"Her Majesty,\\" while seemingly light-hearted and playful, point to deeper issues within the band's internal dynamics and the complex friendship between these two legendary musicians. Perhaps these nicknames served as a coping mechanism for dealing with the challenges of working closely with a partner for such an extended period. Regardless, this behind-the-scenes glimpse into the lives of these iconic rock stars showcases the passion, talent, and personal struggles that coexisted with their extraordinary musical careers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do you do this: How to keep the airflow vent on a fan clean from obstruction?","completion":"Maintaining the cleanliness and ensuring that the airflow vent on a fan is free from obstruction is crucial for maintaining the optimal performance of the fan. Dust and dirt can accumulate in the vents, reducing airflow, causing the fan to work harder, increasing noise, and potentially shortening the fan's lifespan. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to keep the airflow vent on a fan clean from obstruction: Before you start, it's essential to ensure safety. Always turn off and unplug the fan before you begin any cleaning process. If it's a ceiling fan, you may also need a sturdy ladder to reach the fan properly. **Materials Needed:** 1. Screwdriver - often a Phillips-head, but this will depend on your specific fan. 2. Soft, microfiber cloth - suitable for cleaning delicate surfaces without scratching. 3. Warm water with mild soap - useful for loosening tough dirt. 4. Compressed air - excellent for blowing out dust in hard-to-reach spaces. 5. Vacuum cleaner with nozzle attachment - ideal for sucking up loose dust. 6. Safety goggles and face mask - handy to protect your eyes and lungs from dust. **Step-by-Step Guide:** **1. Disassemble the Fan:** Start by removing the grilles and other removable parts of the fan. Most fans have a casing that protects the blades. Typically, these can be unscrewed or popped off. Refer to the fan’s manual if you aren’t sure. For ceiling fans, you usually just need to remove the glass or plastic light covers for cleaning. **2. Vacuum the Fan:** Use your vacuum’s nozzle attachment to go over the fan. This includes the blades, vents, and inside the fan's housing. Vacuuming will get rid of the majority of the loose dust and prevent it from spreading around when you clean more deeply. **3. Clean the Grilles or Fan Blades:** Use a microfiber cloth and the warm soapy water to wipe down the fan blades or the grilles. Make sure you wring out the cloth well before cleaning so you don't drip water into the fan's motor. **4. Use Compressed Air:** Compressed air is excellent for cleaning vents and the inside parts of the fan that you can't reach with the cloth. You can buy compressed air in a can with a long nozzle, or if you have an air compressor, you can use that. Blow the air through the vents and into any other nooks and crannies where dust can hide. **5. Dry the Fan:** After you've finished cleaning, make sure you dry the fan thoroughly. Any moisture left in the fan can damage the motor. You can use a dry cloth to wipe down the parts, or you can let the fan air dry. If you're letting it air dry, make sure it's entirely dry before you reassemble it. **6. Reassemble the Fan:** Once all the components are dry, reassemble your fan. Make sure all parts are secure and that the fan is stable. **7. Routine Cleaning:** To prevent dust build-up, try to clean your fan every few weeks or at least once a month, depending on dust levels in your environment. Regular cleaning enhances the efficiency and longevity of the fan. By following these steps, you should be able to keep the airflow vent on a fan clean from obstruction. Remember, a well-maintained fan not only operates more efficiently and quietly, but can also last longer, providing you with better value for your investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Namur was divided into the 'City' on the flat northern bank of the River Sambre and the Citadel on high ground to the south controlling access to the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Van Coehoorn strengthened the 'inner' Citadel with new outworks at Fort William and La Casotte but did not have time to do the same for the 'outer' City area.

Answer: The strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to dominate Central and Eastern Europe. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was founded on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and aspired to lead these ideologies around the globe. This political philosophy sought to dismantle capitalism, establish socialism, and finally realize communism, a society free from class division and oppression. 1. Marxism: As the backbone of Soviet thought, Marxism was the revolutionary theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It held that history was shaped by class struggle, with the workers (proletariat) pitted against the ruling class (bourgeoisie). Marxism advocated for the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a socialist system, where means of production, distribution, and exchange would be owned collectively by the people. 2. Leninism: Developed by Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, Leninism is an interpretation of Marxist thought tailored to the specific conditions of early 20th-century Russia. Lenin emphasized the need for a vanguard party and professional revolutionaries to lead the working class in seizing power. He also introduced the notion of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism, which expanded the scope of worldwide revolutionary struggle. 3. Socialism: Integral to the Soviet vision was the promotion of socialism, which envisions public ownership of the means of production and distribution. This broad ideology aimed to narrow the gap between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, leading to the establishment of a workers' state. Many aspects of socialism, such as free education, healthcare, and a planned economy, were implemented in the Soviet Union. 4. Communism: The ultimate goal of the Soviet Union was to establish communist societies across the globe, transcending the various stages of Marxist theory. Communism represents a stateless, classless society in which human labor is no longer exploited, and wealth and resources are distributed according to need. The Soviet Union sought to inspire and assist communist movements worldwide in an effort to reach this state. 5. Anti-Imperialism: Soviet ideology prioritized anti-imperialist policies, considering imperialism to be the highest stage of capitalism and a primary source of global inequality. The USSR actively supported decolonization movements and offered economic, military, and political assistance to countries struggling against imperialism. 6. Internationalism and Solidarity: Rooted in the idea that the working class struggle was a global struggle, the Soviet Union promoted internationalism and solidarity among nations. Through organizations such as the Comintern (Communist International) and later the World Federation of Trade Unions, the USSR aimed to unite workers globally around the cause of socialism and class struggle. These ideologies not only shaped the internal structure and policies of the Soviet Union but also played a key role in its foreign policy, especially during the Cold War. The USSR actively sought to export its political model and forge alliances with communist and socialist movements worldwide, contributing to the global geopolitical rivalry between the Eastern and Western Blocs. Throughout its history, the Soviet Union aspired to lead these ideologies around the globe, challenging the dominance of capitalism and promoting its vision for an equitable, just, and compassionate society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2. 1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last. Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\". It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was one of their albums?","completion":"One of their albums was \\"Speaking in Tongues,\\" as mentioned in the text: \\"1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, 'Burning Down the House'.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene. On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Toyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds - two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media. It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \\"outdoing\\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \\"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\\". He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \\"panicked\\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene. According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \\"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Oystein\\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \\"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\\".","completion":"This text is about Oystein Aarseth, better known by his stage name Euronymous, a Norwegian guitarist and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV and, beginning with the ninth season, VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Beginning with the seventh season, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews and Carson Kressley are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the start of season 3, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the start of season 7, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and Santino Rice, who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, Jeffrey Moran (Absolut Vodka marketing executive), or Lucian Piane. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons. Prior to the grande finale, the three main judges are joined by two celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included Paula Abdul, Pamela Anderson, Eve, Ariana Grande, Neil Patrick Harris, Kathy Griffin, Debbie Harry, Khloe Kardashian, La Toya Jackson, Adam Lambert, Demi Lovato, Bob Mackie, Rose McGowan, Olivia Newton-John, Rebecca Romijn, Gigi Hadid, Sharon Osbourne, Dan Savage, John Waters, Michelle Williams, Candis Cayne, Martha Wash, Natalie Cole, Dita Von Teese, Niecy Nash, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Wilmer Valderrama, The Pointer Sisters, Trina, Leah Remini, The B-52's, Kesha and Lady Gaga. The judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the episode's winner and which two had the weakest performances. The day before judging, the contestants are all provided with a song to which they must learn the lyrics. The contestants deemed as being the bottom two must \\"lip sync for their lives\\" to the song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves. RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \\"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\\" The phrase \\"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is CUNT.

Ultimately, it is mentioned that \\"RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves.\\" The qualities RuPaul seeks in the contestants include \\"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent.\\" This suggests that RuPaul makes the decision based on the contestants' overall performance and qualities rather than just personal preference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"John is prouder of having gone than people who don't know him would expect me to believe he would be.\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? OPTIONS: - unacceptable; - acceptable;...I think the answer is","completion":"Acceptable. A linguist evaluates a sentence's acceptability based on its adherence to syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules within the context of a specific language. An acceptable sentence should be grammatically correct, convey meaning effectively, and fall within the range of sentences that native speakers of the language would consider normal to use. The sentence \\"John is prouder of having gone than people who don't know him would expect me to believe he would be\\" adheres to English syntax, meaning that it follows the correct word order and sentence structure. The verb phrases \\"is prouder of having gone\\" and \\"would expect me to believe\\" are constructed correctly, and the comparative construction \\"than people who don't know him\\" is also used appropriately. Semantically, the sentence communicates a clear meaning. The main subject, \\"John,\\" is compared to an implied class of people who would have certain expectations about him. This comparison is made based on the degree of his pride (\\"prouder\\") in having gone somewhere or completed a task. Pragmatically, the sentence is also acceptable within the context of the English language. It may be considered complex due to its length and multiple embedded phrases but native speakers of English can still grasp its meaning. The sentence succeeds in conveying information about both John and the people who have expectations about him, and it addresses the relationship between the two groups. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate this sentence as \\"acceptable\\" because it complies with the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules of the English language. While the sentence structure may seem convoluted, the successful usage of verb phrases, proper comparatives, and clear communication of meaning make it linguistically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Take the hand you want to make the peace sign with, and hold it in front of you, open palmed, with your palm facing away from your body. Rake your fingers, excluding your pointer and middle finger, and fold them into your palm like you are making a fist. Make sure your thumb is over your other fingers. Raise your index and middle fingers. The index finger is the closest finger to your thumb. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. This is how you make the standard peace sign with your hand, Your extended index and middle fingers should form a “V.” Keep your clenched fingers and palm pointed away from your body. This is very important. When you keep your palm facing inward toward yourself, the gesture can be perceived as offensive in some cultures, almost a double middle finger. Make sure you put your pointer finger and your middle finger out at the same time. If you put your middle finger out first it can mean something very bad in English (and in many other languages). Don't stick out your little finger; this, too, has an alternate, obscene interpretation. When done correctly, the peace sign became a counter-cultural symbol of peace in the Vietnam War. Most people raise their hand in the air while making it. Some people consider the meaning of the symbol to be a call for an end to war, and some people think of it as a general call for peace in the world. Some politicians have made the sign with both hands while raising both arms (Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower). This can be a cliche, though, that brings to mind Nixon. Many people just raise one arm when making the sign. When some people see the peace sign, they think of it as a “V” sign that means victory, especially in war. The V sign is also made by holding up the two fingers closest to the thumb in a V formation. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. Allied troops started using this hand sign to indicate victory during World War II. Winston Churchill used the sign to indicate victory. So did Nixon, in the context of Vietnam. Protesters who were against Vietnam then started using the same sign and saying “peace” as they did it instead, to protest the war. They wanted to change the hand gesture to a symbol of peace. The point is to be aware that the hand signal has both a history in the anti-war movement and in representing victory during war. This sign is another hand signal that derived from the television show, Star Trek. Its meaning is “live long and prosper.” To make it, press together the two fingers closest to your thumb at the same time you press together the two fingers farthest away from your thumb. The middle of your hand will form the “V” shape when you do this with your fingers. You should keep your thumb extended outward as you do so. Historically, the Vulcan was a pagan deity, a sun god who was linked to powerful energy such as thunderbolts.","completion":"To make a standard peace sign, hold your hand open-palmed with your palm facing away from your body.

The peace sign has been used to represent both an end to war and victory in war, particularly during the Vietnam War and World War II. Politicians like Richard Nixon and Winston Churchill have also used the sign to indicate victory. Additionally, there is another hand signal derived from Star Trek called the Vulcan salute, which means \\"live long and prosper\\" and is formed by pressing together the two fingers closest and farthest from the thumb, with the thumb extended outward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Washington: A research conducted at the University of Maryland looks at the numerous complex reasons as to why young children decide to include or exclude other kids from their group of friends. It suggests that the kids' decision-making process is much more complex than previously believed. \\"They take into account group information, ranging from cliques and networks, when deciding what makes a group work well. Sometimes kids are excluded because they lack social skills, but a lot of time it has nothing to do with that. Instead it has to do with what we refer to as 'group membership' such as gender, race, nation, and culture,\\" says Professor Melanie Killen, the Associate Director of the Centre for Children Relationships and Culture at Maryland, who led the 4-year project. Reporting their findings in the journal, the researcher said whatever was the reason, individuals who experienced long-term exclusion from the group of friends suffered from depression, anxiety and loneliness. The study looked at two models to define how children make decisions regarding acceptance of other kids in their group -- the individual social _ model and the inter-group social cognition model. While the former says that children's rejection occurs due to social deficits like shyness, wariness or fearfulness, the latter says that it happens because of group dynamics, prejudice and exclusion. It was also found that the age of children was also a factor that influenced their decisions regarding other kids' acceptance as friends. \\"With age, kids become more aware of group dynamics, conventions, customs, and rituals. With this comes a greater concern about group functioning, which can lead to exclusion which can be negative from a social justice viewpoint,\\" says Killen. The researcher believes that her study may have many benefits, as it could provide insights into how to help when children are rejected by their peers. Question: One of the major purposes of the research is to _ . Answer: pick from the following. [A]. tell the reader how to tell inclusion from exclusion. [B]. remind children to be careful while making friends. [C]. seek ways to help kids excluded by their peers. [D]. stop the children belonging to the inter-group social cognition model.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. (September 6, 1888 - November 18, 1969) was an American businessman, investor, and politician known for his high-profile positions in United States politics. Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy, and three of their nine children attained distinguished political positions: President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968), and longtime Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy (1932-2009). He was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. Kennedy wanted his eldest son, Joe Jr., to become president, but after Joe Jr.'s death in August 1944, he became determined to make his second son, John, president. Kennedy was consigned to the political shadows after his remarks during World War II (\\"Democracy is finished\\"), and he remained an intensely controversial figure among U.S. citizens because of his suspect business credentials, his Roman Catholicism, his opposition to Roosevelt's foreign policy, and his support for Joseph McCarthy. As a result, his presence in John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign had to be downplayed. However, Kennedy still drove the campaign behind the scenes. He played a central role in planning strategy, fundraising, and coalition and alliance building. Kennedy almost oversaw the entire operation, supervising spending, helping to select advertising agencies, phoning local and state party leaders, newsmen, and business leaders. Kennedy connections and influence were turned directly into political capital for the senatorial and presidential campaigns of sons John, Robert and Ted. Historian Richard J. Whalen describes Kennedy's influence on John Kennedy's policy decisions in his biography of Joe. Joe was influential in creating the Kennedy Cabinet (Robert Kennedy as Attorney General although he had never argued or tried a case, for example). However, in 1961, Joe Kennedy suffered a stroke that placed even more limitations on his influence in his sons' political careers. Kennedy expanded the Kennedy Compound, which continues as a major center of family get-togethers. When John Kennedy was asked about the level of involvement and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory over Richard Nixon, he would joke that on the eve before the election his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win: there was no way he was paying \\"for a landslide\\". Kennedy was one of four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Nathaniel Fillmore, and George Herbert Walker Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son. How did Kennedy encourage presidential ambitions?","completion":"Kennedy encouraged presidential ambitions by playing a central role in planning strategy, fundraising, and coalition and alliance building for his sons' political campaigns.

Please write a short summary for the following article: European migrant crisis: Austria, Germany near capacity After absorbing more than 12,000 refugees, Austria wants to see a gradual reduction in the numbers of refugees coming through, Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said. \\"We have always said this is an emergency situation, which we have to handle quickly and humanely,\\" Faymann said Sunday. \\"We have helped more than 12,000 people in an acute situation. We must now step by step go from emergency measures to a normality that is humane and complies with the law.\\" The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates that 366,402 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe this year, with 2,800 dead or missing. Those who make the crossing face uncertain futures in European nations, which differ in their approach to asylum seekers. Austria's border with Hungary remains open to potential refugees, Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits said Sunday, and packed buses and trains continued to arrive. Despite the government's desire to curb migrant flow, there has been an outpouring of support from Austrians. Many have brought food and water and cheered for the refugees pouring onto the platform at Vienna's train station. The Austrian Red Cross has also been on hand to provide medical supplies and warm blankets. One recent arrival, standing with his two daughters, told CNN of the family's difficult journey through Hungary. \\"We went through a torture,\\" he said. \\"We walked 110 kilometers (68 miles) with the children. They didn't allow us to take cars or trains.\\" But the Hungarian people, he said, \\"were very nice. We arrived here safely, and we are comfortable here, and we like the people and the government of Austria.\\" Most of the arrivals in Austria intend to travel farther into Europe, however. Of the thousands who have arrived there this weekend, only a dozen or so have opted to apply for asylum there, the country's Interior Ministry said. Germany is attractive to refugees because of its robust economy, strong democracy and long history of taking in refugees. But it, too, can't keep taking in refugees at the current pace. \\"The great helpfulness that Germany has shown in these last weeks and months should not be worn thin,\\" the Interior Ministry said in a statement Sunday. It called for all European countries to work together and share responsibility. \\"Only if that is guaranteed can Germany continue its do its part in helping the large number of asylum-seekers,\\" the statement said. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said as much Saturday, telling his European counterparts that Germany's acceptance of the thousands fleeing conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan must not be the practice in the coming days, according to the website of the German newspaper Die Zeit. The government has said it will accept 800,000 applications for asylum from refugees. A poll released by broadcaster ARD on Thursday found 88% of Germans willing to donate clothes or money to refugees, and 67% willing to volunteer to help them. Some 5,000 migrants arrived on Sunday at the train station in Munich, according to police there. The country's interior ministry said around 8,000 arrived in southern Germany the day before. After arriving, the people are registered, fingerprinted and brought to shelters or temporary housing such as university dorms or even shipping containers that have been converted into living spaces. Pope Francis implored Catholic institutions throughout Europe on Sunday to show mercy to the flood of refugees arriving on their shores by offering them shelter. \\"May every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary of Europe host a family, starting from my diocese of Rome,\\" Francis said at the end of his Angelus prayers in Rome. \\"The two parishes in the Vatican these days will welcome two families of refugees.\\" The Pope's urging came as more than 12,000 migrants poured into Austria on Sunday, the Interior Ministry said, arriving at train stations to applause, cheers and pats on the back from Austrians eager to help them. There were similar scenes at train stations in Germany. In Saalfeld, a crowd of locals stood on the platform clapping and singing in English, \\"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\\" as migrants arrived. Many of the migrants arrive with harrowing tales of crossing the Mediterranean, then walking from Greece through Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and finally into Austria. It is in Hungary that many say they endured the worst treatment. Buses took them to two transit camps, where migrants and their advocates say conditions are inhumane. CNN was not allowed in. Amnesty International representative Barbora Cernusakova said she visited the camp in Roszke, just over the border from Serbia, on Sunday. \\"There were a number of refugees who didn't want to stay at this collection point, and I don't blame them because there are absolutely no facilities,\\" she told CNN. She said migrants have complained of overcrowding, no access to toilets and sanitation facilities, and verbal abuse by police. \\"These are simply not conditions where you put a person who's been through a traumatizing journey through several countries,\\" she said. Many of these people have been walking for a number of days, and actually these people are in many, many cases escaping an armed conflict. This is absolutely unacceptable.\\" Hungary's right-wing government, trying to stop the flood of migrants, has erected a barbed-wire fence along its more than 160-kilometer (100-mile) border with Serbia to prevent them from crossing there. Lawmakers last week passed bills aimed at tightening border restrictions, according to Hungarian news agency MTI. Hungary's government has blamed the onslaught of migration on the European Union's immigration policy and on statements made by European politicians that could be understood as welcoming migrants. UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said there are a number of things European nations could do to help. \\"First of all, once people arrive in Europe, what we're proposing is that there be reception centers, registration centers run by the EU, supported by UNHCR in Greece and Italy and also in Hungary so that they could claim asylum in those countries,\\" she said. \\"But it would only work if there is a relocation in place into other countries of Europe -- not just Germany, not just Sweden, not just Austria.\\" West to blame for migrant crisis? CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Vienna; CNN's Kim Hutcherson, Melissa Gray and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Vasco Cotovio, Sara Mazloumsaki, Kellie Morgan, Gul Tuysuz and Radina Gigova contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"Following a huge influx of refugees into Austria and Germany in the past week, political leaders have suggested that their countries are reaching capacity and cannot continue to take in refugees at the current rate.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

The Rosetta probe, which is a special spaceship from Europe, has captured some really cool pictures of a comet it has been following in outer space! Now you might be asking, \\"What is a comet?\\" Well, a comet is kind of like a giant snowball made up of ice, rocks, and dust. Sometimes, a comet comes really close to the sun, and when it does, it can light up and create a beautiful, glowing tail. Comets zoom around in space, just like the other objects we've talked about, such as planets and stars. So, let's talk about this special spaceship called the Rosetta probe. This probe was launched way back in 2004 by the European Space Agency to explore a comet called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It took ten long years for the Rosetta probe to reach the comet, but in 2014, it finally caught up to it! Now, the Rosetta probe has captured some new and amazing images that it's sending back to Earth. These pictures help scientists learn more about the comet like its size, shape, and what it is made of. By studying these pictures, the scientists can also find out more about how our solar system was formed. The Rosetta probe did not only take pictures, but it also sent a little robot called Philae to land on the comet's surface in 2014. Philae helped scientists gather more information about the comet's structure and how it behaves when it is traveling through space. In conclusion, little friends, thanks to the Rosetta probe, we got some really terrific images of a comet in space. These pictures help us understand more about these icy, rocky snowballs flying around in our solar system. And who knows, maybe one day you'll become a space scientist too and discover something new and exciting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided biography of Bernhard Jetter, the following details can be extrapolated: - Name: His name is Bernhard Jetter. - Birth Date: His birth year is given as 1862. However, the specific date of birth is not mentioned in the bio. - Birth Place: As stated in the biography, Bernhard Jetter was born in Germany. The exact city or region in Germany isn't specified. - Service Years: An exact range of service years isn't clearly indicated in the biography. Since he was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry in 1890 during the Battle of Wounded Knee, his service years necessarily include this period. The biography mentions that he served during the Indian Wars, which occurred from 1865 until approximately 1890, so it can be deduced that Bernhard Jetter served in the last part of this period. - Death Date: Bernhard Jetter died on August 23, 1927. - Death Place: The biography does not specify where Bernhard Jetter passed away. - Place of Burial and Place of Burial Label: The biography does not provide any details concerning Bernhard Jetter's place of burial or a specific label for it. - Allegiance: Based on the biography, Bernhard Jetter's allegiance was with the U.S Army, indicating he pledged allegiance to the United States. - Rank: The bio does not detail Bernhard Jetter's military rank. - Branch: Bernhard Jetter served in the U.S. Army, per the biography. - Unit: Bernhard Jetter served with the 7th U.S. Cavalry. - Battles: The Battle of Wounded Knee on December 29, 1890, is mentioned in the biography.

Here is a news article: Donald Trump is displayed on large screens above the AIPAC 2016 Policy Conference on March 21, at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. | Getty Trump declares himself a friend of Israel: 'Believe me' Donald Trump took the stage to warm applause and immediately declared himself as “a friend and lifelong supporter of Israel,” declaring that his “number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.” And he punctuated that point, and almost everything else he said before a crowd of nearly 20,000 attendees at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, with a familiar colloquialism: “Believe me.” Story Continued Below “I didn’t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That’s what politicians do: all talk, no action, believe me,” Trump said, promising to focus on his vision of the future U.S.-Israel relationship. Trump’s speech, the first given from prepared remarks since he launched his campaign last June and read from a teleprompter, is an effort by the GOP frontrunner to convey more substance and policy depth—and to reassure those concerned about his statements of neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which he appeared to walk back in a live CNN interview an hour before taking the stage. “I would love to be neutral if it’s possible. It’s probably not possible because there’s so much hatred,” the Republican front-runner told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “There’s so much going on.” In his AIPAC speech, Trump sought to clarify his statements of neutrality by criticizing \\"the culture of hatred that's been fermenting\\" in Palestine \\"for years.\\" \\"There is no moral equivalency,\\" he said. \\"Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians.\\" As he spoke from the rotating circular stage at the center of the floor of the Verizon Center, his remarks about the Iran deal, specifically his statement that he’s “studied the issue more than any other candidate,” drew light laughter mixed with applause, as did later ad libs that felt familiar to those who’ve watched his campaign—well-worn riffs about his deal-making prowess, his high poll numbers and the success of his memoir. But he continued to stick to the scripted speech he and top aides, including his son-in-law, finalized last week. He called the monetary rewards Iran has paid to Palestinian terrorists “deplorable,” and promised to dismantle the nation’s global terrorism network. “Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world,” he continued, accusing Iran of perpetuating terror attacks “in 25 different countries on five continents.” He also vowed to punish Iran for firing long-range ballistic missiles even after finalizing the nuclear agreement with the U.S. in an attempt, Trump said, “ to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten Europe, and, someday, the United States. “Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles – in both Hebrew and Farsi – were the words ‘Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth’,” he continued. “What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another twisted part - testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made!” “The deal is silent on test missiles but those tests do violate UN Security Council Resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it,” Trump said, adding a line that wasn’t part of his prepared remarks. “But we will,” he added, as the applause thundered down from the rafters. Trump got his biggest ovation for declaring it was President Obama’s final year in office: “Yay.” He smiled as the crowd showered him in cheers. ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the 2016 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference at the Verizon Center, on Monday, March 21, 2016, in Washington. (AP... (Associated Press) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the 2016 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference at the Verizon Center, on Monday, March 21, 2016, in Washington. (AP... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Confronting doubts about the depth of his knowledge of world affairs, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump delivered a sober speech to a pro-Israel crowd on Monday and outlined for the first time the team of foreign policy thinkers advising his campaign. In a lengthy interview with the editorial board of The Washington Post, Trump outlined a distinctly non-interventionist approach for America in the world. It came with doubts about the benefits of the country's decades of foreign engagement, including its role as an anchor of NATO. \\"I do think it's a different world today, and I don't think we should be nation-building anymore,\\" Trump told the newspaper. He stressed instead the need to invest in infrastructure at home. \\"At what point do you say, 'Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?'\\" he said. \\"So, I know the outer world exists and I'll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.\\" Trump has largely avoided the nitty-gritty of policy details during his campaign, focusing instead on boldly-stated goals and declining to say who he counts among his advisers — despite repeated promises to do so. The billionaire businessman said last week in an interview with MSNBC that his \\"primary consultant is myself.\\" His newly-announced team, chaired by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, includes Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz — a group with varying degrees of foreign policy experience. During the interview, Trump stumbled when questioning the U.S. role in assisting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia and arguing other members of NATO should be doing more. \\"They're not doing anything. And I say: 'Why is it that Germany's not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of Ukraine, why aren't they dealing?\\" he said. \\"Why are we always the one that's leading, potentially the third world war with Russia?'\\" In fact, since the Ukraine crisis erupted more than two years ago, the Obama administration has refused to provide the new, pro-Western government in Kiev offensive military equipment to use against Russian-backed separatists. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and has only received defensive materiel from the U.S. and its allies. And while a February 2015 ceasefire helped reduce the worst of the violence, Germany and France spearheaded that mediation effort. The United States wasn't directly involved. Trump has also drawn concerns from Jewish leaders for saying he would attempt to be \\"neutral\\" in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He worked to soothe those worries Monday in a major speech before the annual gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington. In a speech delivered from prepared remarks and a teleprompter — a rarity for Trump, who has panned Democrats for using the device —Trump stressed that he is \\"a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.\\" Trump's remarks largely focused on Iran, calling the deal reached between the Islamic nation and several world powers aimed at keeping it from acquiring nuclear weapons \\"catastrophic for America, for Israel and to the whole Middle East.\\" But he also discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said he would reject any attempt by the United Nations to impose conditions on either side during future peace talks. He stressed that \\"each side\\" in any deal \\"must give up something.\\" \\"It will only further delegitimize Israel,\\" he said of a peace accord imposed on the two sides. \\"It will be a disaster and catastrophe to Israel. It's not going to happen, folks.\\" While Trump assured the crowd that he \\"didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel,\\" saying, \\"that's what politicians do,\\" he noted that in 2004 he served as the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade in New York. \\"It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did,\\" Trump said. He also ended his speech by announcing that his daughter, who married a Jewish man and converted to Judaism, is about to give birth. \\"My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby,\\" he said. Outside the venue Monday evening, anti-Trump protesters gathered to voice anger over his brash political rhetoric and his attendance at the conference. But there was no mass walk-out of AIPAC attendee or other demonstration inside the hall, as some had planned. He was followed on stage by rival Ted Cruz, who opened his speech by pointedly noting Trump's use of the term Palestine. Although the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted in 2012 to recognize Palestine as a \\"non-member observer state,\\" the U.S. does not currently recognize the Palestinian territories as an independent state and the Texas senator didn't miss the chance to take a dig at the front-runner. \\"Perhaps to the surprise of the previous speaker, Palestine has not existed since 1948,\\" said Cruz. __ Associated Press writer Bradley Klapper contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jill Colvin on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In an address to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Donald Trump referred to himself as \\"a friend and lifelong supporter of Israel.\\" He declared his number-one priority is to dismantle the deal with Iran.

Bei einer globalisierten Wirtschaft sind Wechselkurse einer der entscheidenden Faktoren, die den internationalen Handel und Investitionen beeinflussen. Unternehmen, die Geschäfte in verschiedenen Währungen tätigen oder in ausländischen Märkten investieren, sind einem Wechselkursrisiko ausgesetzt. Dieses Risiko resultiert aus der Möglichkeit, dass der Wert einer Währung im Vergleich zu einer anderen schwankt. Wenn der Wechselkurs ungünstig schwankt, kann dies zu finanziellen Verlusten für ein Unternehmen führen. Beispielsweise kann ein deutsches Unternehmen, das seine Produkte in den USA verkauft, Einnahmen in US-Dollar erzielen. Wenn der Wechselkurs des Euro gegenüber dem US-Dollar an Wert verliert, erhalten die deutschen Unternehmen weniger Euro für ihre US-Dollar-Einnahmen. Ebenso kann ein deutsches Unternehmen, das Rohstoffe oder Dienstleistungen in US-Dollar bezahlt, bei einer Aufwertung des US-Dollars gegenüber dem Euro höhere Kosten in Euro haben. In beiden Fällen können negative Wechselkursschwankungen zu Verlusten für das Unternehmen führen. Um solche Verluste zu vermeiden oder zu minimieren, können Unternehmen verschiedene Strategien anwenden. Dazu gehören zum Beispiel Absicherungsinstrumente wie Devisentermingeschäfte, Devisenoptionen oder Währungsswaps. Diese finanziellen Instrumente ermöglichen es Unternehmen, sich gegen Wechselkursschwankungen abzusichern, indem sie den zukünftigen Wechselkurs für eine bestimmte Währung im Voraus festlegen oder die Option erhalten, zu einem vorher festgelegten Kurs zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen. Ein weiterer Ansatz zur Begrenzung des Wechselkursrisikos besteht darin, die Verschuldung und Investitionen in einer Währung zu diversifizieren. Unternehmen können auch versuchen, ihre Geschäftsaktivitäten und Einnahmequellen über verschiedene Währungen und geografische Gebiete hinweg zu diversifizieren, um ihr Risiko zu streuen. Insgesamt ist es wichtig, das Wechselkursrisiko und das damit verbundene Verlustpotenzial zu verstehen und angemessene Vorsichtsmaßnahmen zu ergreifen, um mögliche finanzielle Verluste aufgrund von Wechselkursschwankungen zu minimieren. Durch die Anwendung geeigneter Risikomanagementstrategien können Unternehmen ihr Engagement gegenüber unerwünschten Wechselkursbewegungen reduzieren und somit ihre finanzielle Stabilität gewährleisten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: The hand might look like an X-ray from the doctor's office, but it is actually a cloud of material ejected from a star that exploded. NASA's NuSTAR spacecraft has imaged the structure in high-energy X-rays for the first time, shown in blue. Lower-energy X-ray light previously detected by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is shown in green and red. Religion and astronomy may not overlap often, but a new NASA X-ray image captures a celestial object that resembles the \\"Hand of God.\\" The cosmic \\"hand of God\\" photo was produced when a star exploded and ejected an enormous cloud of material, which NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, glimpsed in high-energy X-rays, shown in blue in the photo. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory had imaged the green and red parts previously, using lower-energy X-rays. \\"NuSTAR's unique viewpoint, in seeing the highest-energy X-rays, is showing us well-studied objects and regions in a whole new light,\\" NuSTAR telescope principal investigator Fiona Harrison, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a statement. The new image depicts a pulsar wind nebula, produced by the dense remnant of a star that exploded in a supernova. What's left behind is a pulsar, called PSR B1509-58 (B1509 for short), which spins around 7 times per second blowing a wind of particles into material ejected during the star's death throes. As these particles interact with nearby magnetic fields, they produce an X-ray glow in the shape of a hand. (The pulsar is located near the bright white spot in the image but cannot be seen itself, NASA officials said.) Scientists aren't sure whether the ejected material actually assumes the shape of a hand, or whether its interaction with the pulsar's particles is just making it appear that way. \\"We don't know if the hand shape is an optical illusion,\\" Hongjun An, of McGill University in Montreal, said in a statement. \\"With NuSTAR, the hand looks more like a fist, which is giving us some clues.\\" The red cloud appearing at the fingertips is a separate structure called RCW 89. The pulsar's wind may be heating the cloud to produce the low-energy X-ray glow, astronomers believe. The X-ray energies seen by NuSTAR range from 7 to 25 kiloelectron volts, or keV, whereas the energies seen by Chandra range from 0.5 to 2 keV. The Hand of God is an example of pareidolia, the psychological phenomenon of perceiving familiar shapes in random or vague images. Other common forms of pareidolia include seeing animals or faces in clouds, or the man in the moon. Despite its supernatural appearance, the Hand of God was produced by natural astrophysical phenomena. Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

The hand might look like an X-ray from the doctor's office, but it is actually a cloud of material ejected from a star that exploded. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Yale University All of the dots are active black holes tucked inside the hearts of galaxies, with colors representing different energies of X-ray light. Two new views from NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, showcase the telescope's talent for spying objects near and far. One image shows the energized remains of a dead star, a structure nicknamed the \\"Hand of God\\" after its resemblance to a hand. Another image shows distant black holes buried in blankets of dust. \\"NuSTAR's unique viewpoint, in seeing the highest-energy X-rays, is showing us well-studied objects and regions in a whole new light,\\" said Fiona Harrison, the mission's principal investigator at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. NuSTAR launched into space June 13, 2012, on a mission to explore the high-energy X-ray universe. It is observing black holes, dead and exploded stars and other extreme objects in our own Milky Way galaxy and beyond. The new \\"Hand of God\\" image shows a nebula 17,000 light-years away, powered by a dead, spinning star called PSR B1509-58, or B1509 for short. The dead star, called a pulsar, is the leftover core of a star that exploded in a supernova. The pulsar is only about 19 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter but packs a big punch: it is spinning around nearly seven times every second, spewing particles into material that was upheaved during the star's violent death. These particles are interacting with magnetic fields around the ejected material, causing it to glow with X-rays. The result is a cloud that, in previous images, looked like an open hand. One of the big mysteries of this object, called a pulsar wind nebula, is whether the pulsar's particles are interacting with the material in a specific way to make it appear as a hand, or if the material is in fact shaped like a hand. \\"We don't know if the hand shape is an optical illusion,\\" said Hongjun An of McGill University, Montreal, Canada. \\"With NuSTAR, the hand looks more like a fist, which is giving us some clues.\\" The second image from NuSTAR shows active, supermassive black holes between 3 and 10 billion light-years away in a well-studied patch of sky called the COSMOS field (for Cosmic Evolution Survey). Each dot is a voracious black hole at the heart of a galaxy, actively feeding off a surrounding disk of material. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes have identified many of the black holes in this field, but some are so heavily obscured in gas and dust that NuSTAR's higher-energy X-ray observations are needed to characterize and understand them. Astronomers hope to use NuSTAR to provide new demographics on the numbers, types and distances to black holes that populate our universe. \\"This is a hot topic in astronomy,\\" said Francesca Civano of Yale University, New Haven, Conn. \\"We want to understand how black holes grew in the past and the degree to which they are obscured.\\" The ongoing research will help explain how black holes and galaxies grow and interact with each other. NuSTAR is a Small Explorer mission led by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in Pasadena, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The spacecraft was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Va.

NuStar's new image shows the hand in more vivid colour Scientists said it was a nebula - a cloud of gas - around a neutron star called PSR B1509-58, or B1509 for short. Neutron stars are created when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse. The star has collapsed so much, Nasa says it is only 12 miles across and incredibly dense. When it collapsed, it also caused an explosion which cast gas and material out into space. It revolves at seven times a second and in doing so it throws out huge amounts of sub-atomic particles in streams. The original image of the 'Hand of God' taken by the Chandra telescope It is the interaction between the particles and the gas that, when photographed with a special camera, create the amazing image. A previous image of the \\"hand\\" was captured in 2009 by Nasa's Chandra X-ray observatory - a telescope contained in a satellite which is able to see X-rays 100 times fainter than any detector on Earth. The new image was taken by the agency's \\"black-hole hunting\\" Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar) which is able to see even the highest energy X-rays. Nasa says B1509 is 17,000 light years away. The image has been likened to Michelangelo's Hands Of God And Adam It has an intense magnetic field at its surface, estimated to be 15 trillion times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. Nasa said: \\"NuStar's view is providing new clues to the puzzle. \\"The hand actually shrinks in the NuStar image, looking more like a fist, as indicated by the blue colour. \\"The northern region, where the fingers are located, shrinks more than the southern part, where a jet lies, implying the two areas are physically different.\\" It is thought the hand was initially nicknamed the \\"hand of God\\" because it bears similarities to a detail from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, dubbed The Hands Of God And Adam. :: Watch Sky News live on television, on Sky channel 501, Virgin Media channel 602, Freeview channel 82 and Freesat channel 202. ||||| A heavenly high-five: Colorful 'Hand of God' is spotted in Space by X-ray telescope hunting for black holes Researchers released the latest images captured by the NuStar X-ray telescope One image shows the 'Hand of God' - a dead star about 17,000 miles away Another image shows surrounding black holes NuStar has been orbiting earth for the last year and a half on a mission to capture better images of black holes An X-ray telescope has captured the 'Hand of God' in space. NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuStar, captured the new image of a dead star nicknamed the 'Hand of God' since it looks like an open hand. NuStar has been circling earth since June 2012, on a mission to gather more information about black holes in our universe. High five: One of NuStar's latest pictures is of the 'Hand of God' which is the remnants of a dead star about 17,000 light-years away 'NuStar's unique viewpoint, in seeing the highest-energy X-rays, is showing us well-studied objects and regions in a whole new light,' Fiona Harrison, the mission's principal investigator at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California said on the university's website. This latest image is helping astronomers learn more about pulsars, which are the remnants of dead stars. The 'Hand of God' is a pulsar 17,000 light-years away. It's only about 12 miles in diameter but spins around about seven times in a second throwing around particles from the dead star. Mission: NuStar has been orbiting earth for the past year and a half on a mission to capture better images of black holes Previous images captured of the pulsar made it look like an outstretched hand (shown in red and blue in the picture), but this new image makes it look more like a fist (shown in blue). 'We don't know if the hand shape is an optical illusion,' said Hongjun An of McGill University. 'With NuStar, the hand looks more like a fist which is giving us some clues.' This new picture leads astronomers to believe that the fingers captured in the original picture are physically different areas from the fist. Astronomers also released another of NuStar's latest images, showing black holes throughout space. Each dot shown in the picture is a different black hole in the surrounding galaxies, with the colors representing different types of X-ray light. Holes in the sky: Another recently released NuStar image show black holes in neighboring galaxies. The dots in blue are the new black holes NuStar has been able to pick up on The red and green dots are what the Chandra X-ray Observatory captured before and the blue dots are the black holes captured by NuStar. The black holes that shine blue are more actively feeding off surrounding clouds of dust and gas. NuStar is the first telescope to capture black holes at such a far distance. The point of finding these black holes is to learn more about the evolution of black holes and the galaxies they belong to. ||||| Summary:","completion":"NASA's NuSTAR spacecraft took a picture of something called the \\"Hand of God\\".

Last Wednesday night, Carter Wilkerson took to Twitter to ask: \\"Yo @Wendys how many retweets for a year of free chicken nuggets?\\" Wendy's responded that 18 million would do the trick. Wilkerson accepted the challenge with this tweet, which had been retweeted about 2.5 million times as of Tuesday morning. For some perspective, the largest retweet ever came after Ellen DeGeneres took to Twitter during the 2014 Oscars, with hers clocking in at just under 3.3 million retweets.

Still, 18 million is a tall order, and the challenge has turned the teen into \\"a global hero with a mission\\" via #NuggsForCarter, notes a post at Twitter itself. The teen spoke to the Reno Gazette-Journal when the tweet first took off, explaining that he sent his original query as a joke. The reaction has been \\"pretty cool,\\" he says, with his father adding that he hopes they can work out some kind of charitable giveaway with Wendy's when the retweeting subsides.

With almost 2.5 million retweets already, Wilkerson's tweet has become the second most popular tweet in history, edging closer to the record held by Ellen DeGeneres. The primary reason behind the massive online support for Wilkerson boils down to something universally loved – crispy, delectable Wendy's chicken nuggets! It all started last Wednesday when Carter Wilkerson decided to indulge in a playful banter with fast-food giant Wendy's on Twitter. He asked: \\"Yo @Wendys how many retweets for a year of free chicken nuggets?\\". Wendy's, known for its witty and engaging presence on social media, responded with a staggering number: 18 million retweets. Wilkerson, undaunted by the enormity of the challenge, took it head on, and his tweet has since been retweeted millions of times, turning him into a global hero on a mission, widely known via #NuggsForCarter. Ellen DeGeneres' selfie with a group of A-list celebrities taken during the 2014 Oscars has held the record for the most retweeted tweet with just under 3.3 million retweets. However, Wilkerson's tweet has seized the second spot recently, surpassing a tweet by Louis Tomlinson of One Direction. While managing 18 million retweets is a tall order, the challenge of #NuggsForCarter has now taken a life of its own. Talking to the Reno Gazette-Journal when his tweet started to gain traction, Wilkerson admits that he had sent the original query as a joke.

The tale revolves around a maiden named Rapunzel, who was locked away in a tower by an evil witch named Dame Gothel. Rapunzel had beautiful, long, and magical golden hair, which grew to an extraordinary length over time. In the story, a young prince is riding through the forest when he hears Rapunzel's enchanting singing coming from the isolated tower. He becomes captivated by her voice and tries to find a way to reach her. However, the tower had no doors or stairs, and the only way to enter the room where Rapunzel was kept was through a small window at the very top. To gain access to Rapunzel, the evil witch Dame Gothel would call out to her, saying, \\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!\\" Upon hearing this, Rapunzel would let down her incredibly long, golden hair, which the witch would then use to climb up to the window and enter the tower. The prince, after observing this method, returned the next day and imitated the witch's voice, calling out the same phrase. In response, Rapunzel unknowingly let down her hair, allowing the prince to climb up and finally meet her. The two of them fell in love instantly, and the prince began visiting Rapunzel regularly through this method. However, their secret meetings are eventually discovered by the evil witch, leading to dramatic events that test their love and eventually result in their escape and reunion.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade.

Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: How can I lose weight quickly in 2 weeks? Second question: How can I lose weight quickly? Need serious help. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"B). Yes. Both questions are essentially asking the same thing, which is how to lose weight quickly. However, the first specifies a time frame of 2 weeks, while the second question does not mention a specific time frame but it can be implied that the user is looking for rapid weight loss. Now that we have established the similarity in these questions, let's provide a detailed answer to the main question: How can I lose weight quickly? Losing weight quickly may sound appealing, but it's important to remember that drastic, rapid weight loss can have negative consequences on your overall health, and may not be sustainable in the long run. Some of the potential ways for losing weight quickly in a short period of time include: 1. Reducing calorie intake: Calculate the number of calories you need to maintain your current weight and reduce this number by 500-1000 calories per day to help create a calorie deficit. This can result in losing 1-2 pounds per week. 2. Cut out processed foods: Eliminate processed and sugary foods from your diet and choose whole, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. These foods are healthier and tend to have fewer calories than processed foods. 3. Track your meals: Keep a food diary or use a food-tracking app to help you monitor what you're eating, manage portion sizes, and maintain accountability for your food choices. 4. Increase protein intake: Consuming more protein can help reduce hunger and cravings, as it takes longer for the body to digest compared to carbohydrates. Good sources of protein include lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. 5. Drink plenty of water: Drinking adequate water can help you stay hydrated and reduce hunger, making it easier to stick to a healthy diet. 6. Incorporate exercise into your routine: Engage in regular physical activity, such as cardio workouts like walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming. In addition, strength training can help build muscle mass, which can improve your metabolism and help burn more calories at rest. 7. Ensure adequate sleep: Getting enough sleep is crucial for weight loss, as inadequate rest can negatively affect your hunger hormones, metabolism, and energy levels. 8. Manage stress: High levels of stress can lead to overeating and weight gain, so finding ways to manage stress effectively, such as through meditation or yoga, may help support your weight loss efforts. 9. Consider intermittent fasting: Intermittent fasting, which involves restricting food intake during designated periods, has been shown to help with weight loss. Examples of intermittent fasting methods include the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window) or the 5:2 method (extremely limiting calorie intake for 2 days a week and eating normally for 5 days). While these strategies may help you lose weight quickly, it's important to remember that gradual, sustainable weight loss is healthier and more likely to result in long-term success. Always consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before embarking on a restrictive diet or exercise plan, especially when seeking rapid weight loss."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While flying to a business meeting, Dave sits next to a man named Buddy Rydell. After a series of annoyances from the flight attendant and a sky marshal cause Dave, who repeatedly wanted a headset to watch an in-flight movie suggested by Buddy, to lose his temper, the sky marshal, who also mistakes Dave for a racist, tasers him, and Dave is arrested for assaulting the flight attendant, and sentenced to anger management therapy. The therapist happens to be Buddy. Buddy's unorthodox techniques cause Dave to lose his temper, and Buddy tells Dave he recognizes his problem as passive-aggressive anger. After Dave gets into a bar fight caused by Chuck, another of Buddy's patients, Dave is sent back to court and Buddy intervenes on his behalf, choosing to move in with Dave and shadow him in his life as part of more intensive therapy. Failure to comply will result in a year of jail time for Dave.

First, we have an equation that looks like this: 292 * v + 18208 = -277 * v 2. Our goal is to find out what \\"v\\" is. 3. To do that, we need to get all the \\"v\\" on one side of the equals sign and everything else on the other side. 4. We start by adding 277 \\"v\\" to both sides of the equation: 292 * v + 18208 + 277 * v = -277 * v + 277 * v This now becomes: (292 * v + 277 * v) + 18208 = 0 5. Now, we can combine the \\"v\\" on the left side of the equation: (292 + 277) * v + 18208 = 0 This now becomes: 569 * v + 18208 = 0 6. Next, we want to get rid of the 18208 from the left side. We'll do this by subtracting 18208 from both sides: 569 * v + 18208 - 18208 = 0 - 18208 This now becomes: 569 * v = -18208 7. Finally, to find the \\"v,\\" we need to divide by 569: v = -18208 / 569 8.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\"?

So, when we are looking at a study about how much people are willing to pay (WTP) for something, we need to check a few things to know if the study is good or not. 1) Are the people in the study a good example of everyone else? 2) Do the people in the study understand and agree with what they are being asked about? 3) Is the way we ask people about their WTP in the study set up to avoid tricky answers? 4) Does WTP change based on how familiar people are with the thing, how big the change is in the thing, or how much money they make? 5) Do the WTP numbers we find match up with other studies about similar things? 6) Do the WTP answers follow the rules we know about in economics?

Maybe my goal is to have a family. Being catholic naturally we gravitate towards larger families. But as a libertarian I don’t see a lot of potential in the United States at it pertains to economic freedoms. I see the government encroaching more and more into our lives. Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political. I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state. Or would I collapse under the political pressures and sign up for agreements I know in my heart and mind won’t help the people. Only time will tell. I just don’t see a point. I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history.

Solve this problem.","completion":"In order to solve the equation -40575 = -1852*o - 2181*o + 32019 for 'o', you first have to simplify the equation by combining like terms. The equation is presented as follows: -40575 = -1852*o - 2181*o + 32019 Since \\"-1852*o - 2181*o\\" are like terms, they can be simply added together. When you add -1852 and -2181, you get -4033. So the simplified equation will be: -40575 = -4033*o + 32019 Now, we need 'o' to be isolated, hence we subtract 32019 from both sides of the equation. Doing this will look like: -40575 - 32019 = -4033*o + 32019 - 32019 This results in: -72594 = -4033*o Next, to solve for 'o', we divide each side of the equation by -4033, So this will be: -72594/-4033 = -4033*o/-4033 Which simplifies to: 18 = o So, the solution to the equation -40575 = -1852*o - 2181*o + 32019 is o = 18."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why is the Moon such a good reflector of light? Does Earth appear as bright on the Moon as the Moon appears on Earth? Is Moon essential for Earth? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"A). no These two questions are inquiring about different pieces of information. The first question is regarding the Moon's reflective property, while the second question pertains to the brightness of Earth as seen from the Moon and whether the Moon is essential for Earth's existence or not. 1) Why is the Moon such a good reflector of light? The Moon's surface is a good reflector of light, largely due to its composition. It consists of regolith, which is a blanket of loose, fragmented rocks, dust, and soil that covers the solid bedrock. Regolith is primarily made up of tiny glass beads that were formed from the heat and high-energy impacts of meteorites striking the Moon's surface. These glass beads have a high reflective index, meaning they reflect back a significant portion of the sunlight that strikes them, causing the Moon to appear bright in our night sky. The Moon's albedo, or reflectivity, is about 0.12, meaning it reflects about 12% of the sunlight that hits it. While this is a relatively low albedo compared to other celestial bodies, the Moon is the closest celestial object to Earth, allowing us to observe the reflected light more easily. 2) Does Earth appear as bright on the Moon as the Moon appears on Earth? Is Moon essential for Earth? - Earth's brightness as seen from the Moon: Earth appears much brighter and also larger from the Moon than the Moon appears to us on Earth. This is due to Earth's greater size, higher albedo (approximately 0.30), and the fact that our atmosphere helps scatter sunlight back into space. Consequently, when astronauts on the Moon observe Earth, it appears significantly brighter and more colorful when compared to the Moon as observed from Earth. - Importance of the Moon for Earth: The Moon plays an essential role in maintaining the stability and habitability of our planet. Its gravitational influence on Earth results in tides, which help in the mixing of ocean waters and the distribution of nutrients for marine life. Furthermore, the Moon's gravitational pull stabilizes Earth's axial tilt, preventing chaotic fluctuations in the planet's climate that would occur without the Moon's presence. In this sense, the Moon is crucial for the existence and sustainability of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Previously known as \\"THE-QS World University Rankings\\", the publisher had collaborated with \\"Times Higher Education magazine\\" (\\"THE\\") to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. QS then chose to still use the pre-existing methodology while \\"THE\\" adopted a new one. The QS system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings, alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS). It is the only international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) approval, and is viewed as one of the most widely read of its kind, along with \\"Academic Ranking of World Universities\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\". However, allocating undue weight to subjective indicators and having highly fluctuating results are its major criticisms. - Cornelius Cardew (7 May 193613 December 1981) was an English experimental music composer, and founder (with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons) of the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental performing ensemble. He later rejected experimental music, explaining why he had \\"discontinued composing in an avantgarde idiom\\" in his own programme notes to his Piano Album 1973 in favour of a politically motivated \\"people's liberation music\\". - Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) has been Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand since 6 February 1952. She is Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. - Howard While Skempton (born 31 October 1947) is an English composer, pianist, and accordionist. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - The New Zealand Order of Merit is an order of chivalry in New Zealand's honours system. It was established by royal warrant on 30 May 1996 by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, \\"for those persons who in any field of endeavour, have rendered meritorious service to the Crown and nation or who have become distinguished by their eminence, talents, contributions or other merits\\", to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Scratch Orchestra was an experimental musical ensemble founded in the spring of 1969 by Cornelius Cardew, Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton. - Philip Dadson is a New Zealand musician and artist , who was in the foundation group for the Scratch Orchestra and founder of From Scratch . He was made an Arts Laureate by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand in 2001 , and an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2005 . He lectured at the Elam School of Fine Arts , part of the University of Auckland from 1977 , leaving in 2001 to take up full - time art practice . He co-authored the 2007 book Slap Tubes and other Plosive Aerophones with fellow instrument inventor Bart Hopkin , whose 1998 CD / book Gravikords , Whirlies & Pyrophones had also featured Dadson 's group From Scratch . - The Elam School of Fine Arts, founded by John Edward Elam, is part of The University of Auckland. Students study degrees in fine art with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach. The school is located across three buildings, the Mondrian building, Building 431 (or the \\"Main\\" fine arts building), and Elam B, which includes the studios for postgraduate and doctoral students on Princes Street, in central Auckland, New Zealand. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - The University of Auckland is the largest university in New Zealand, located in the country's largest city, Auckland. It is the highest-ranked university in the country, being ranked 81st worldwide in the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings. Established in 1883 as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand, the university is made up of eight faculties over six campuses. It has a head count of more than 40,000 students, and more than 30,000 equivalent full-time students. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean.

We closed on our dream house! That day my family’s world was changed forever. While we were taking the traditional family photo in front of the ‘sold’ sign, all smiles, so excited, we didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes. We didn’t know, we were being watched, and plotted against. Our world was about to change. The kids got to pick out the colors for their room, we were buying items we would need, everyone was making big plans, and talking about memories we hoped to make in the future in our new dream home. We had finally found the perfect home for our family! We all walked in the front door that day, ready to start this new adventure; however, I didn’t know my son was being watched and targeted as I sent him out to help bring things in. I didn’t know what was getting ready to come. We left that night around 7. Completely exhausted. We went back to the rental for the night and I got the kids ready for bed. We all finally fell asleep around 11:30 that night. Around midnight, my husband, who was working late that night, got off work and had to stop by the new house to turn the furnace back on since I forgot. The outside lights were on, so it’s well lit. At first the toilet paper didn’t show up that well. The closer my husband got, the more he saw. Not only the toilet paper in the bushes and tree, but the note folded and tucked in the front door.

My CHILD was facing bigotry and hatred at a level I can’t even fathom. JUST FOR THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN!!! I have blacked out the worst word, but you can still see. This is the first part of the letter. There’s no need to post the entire thing. It only got worse. Our house was tp’d and a highly racist, threatening note was left. We just experienced our first ever hate crime. A hate crime AGAINST MY SON!!! A CHILD!! I grew up in Greentown, him as well. He has never had any issues or comments at school or in the community This is a small town where everyone knows everyone. I’m not so naive to think that racism doesn’t happen here, I’m sure it does, we’ve even discussed it and how to handle it and what to do. It’s just never happened to him or us before. I know it exists, but a HATE CRIME?!? A. HATE. CRIME?!? This destroyed his innocence. This destroyed a childhood. This even effected my other 4 kids! This is not an all-white town, nor is this an all-white neighborhood. This one person does not represent this neighborhood or this town. How do I tell my child that this was done? What words do I say to let him know it is not ok and this doesn’t represent this town, where everyone that meets him likes him? That this can’t make him angry and bitter. That he is so much better then what they are portraying him as! His skin color shouldn’t matter. I had to look him in his eyes to talk to him about something I will never understand first, but I saw firsthand the devastation on his face. I watched my child be crushed by someone else hatred and racism. To see the pain in his eyes that is caused by someone’s ignorance. I don’t know how he is strong enough to face this head on and want to try and use this experience he has had as a platform to raise awareness. He wants people to see that racism still exist. It’s real. It hurts. It destroys. It’s devastating, and it effects everyone. He WILL rise above this. He’s going to make beauty from ashes. He will fight this. And he will win. He’s on the honor roll, he swims, he plays soccer, and runs track. He even made show choir. Never gets in trouble. Not to mention he’s kind, sweet, caring, and he bleeds the same as everyone else. There’s nothing “different” about him. I’m mad. I’m crying out for justice! Did you think I would roll over and let you get away with this?! Did you not think that I would not rise up and protect my child? You have forced my child at the age of 15 to face hatred and bigotry at a level I cannot fathom. You have forced him to deal with this issue, that even a grown man should not have been dealt with. And he has face this head-on with more maturity then I could ever imagine for him. He has responded with a maturity well beyond his age. He has every right to be mad. To be hurt. He says he’s “disappointed” and hopes we can stay at the new house anyways “as long as my mom, dad, and siblings will be safe in the house with me staying there too.” He has every right to be mad yet there he sits more worried about his family and if they’ll be safe still. That is him. Thoughtful. Wonderful. Amazing. A CHILD! This shouldn’t have ever happened. I want to move. Yet he wants to stay. He doesn’t want the bully to win. I’d like to say I handled this well and helped him learn something thru all this, but I’m the one that learned something from him. This momma is worried and nervous, and a million other emotions. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, every day I am on high alert. Something as simple as sending him out to catch the bus, has me in a mess. It has us all in a mess. He’s wanting to use this experience as a platform to educate others and raise awareness. Until then, he is scared, he is emotional. I watched my little boy fall apart, I watched him try to make sense of it, I have watched him struggle. . So if you see him out, keep close to him. He needs people that see him for him more than anything now. This momma needs some peace. Most of all PRAY!!! Pray for him and our family. And please help educate others. This can happen anywhere. This is real. This is happening still. This hatred effects everyone involved. I will forgive you for one day, but for now you have instilled in all my heart, a fear I have never had before. You have instilled fear in my family, you have instilled fear and my children. This fear I have is crippling. It’s hard to keep my eyes on God and trust Him as we move forward. I have so many questions and not any answers. I’m broken and disgusted. Though all this, I can tell you- you will not win! You may have knocked us down for the time being, but you have not knocked us out! I have created this GoFundMe to help with the cost of any legal fees that we are about to take on, for a fence that I will now need to put up, and for a security system. Even if you cannot donate, please share. We want to get word out there that this is still going on, and hopefully use this story to make a change. Thank you all in advance for any donation that you give.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Is Henry Hearst poor or wealthy? wealthy A:","completion":"Title: In the Heart of Wealth Plot: The movie begins by introducing Henry Hearst (Act 1). He's an extravagantly wealthy businessman and philanthropist from New York City. Being a self-made billionaire, his success story is a marvel to many, but his wealth is also a facade that hides many secrets from his past. His luxurious lifestyle doesn't bring him the satisfaction and peace he yearns for. Step Explanation: The movie's opening scene sets the stage. Henry Hearst's character and his wealth are introduced. This gives the audience background, setting, and initial character development. As the plot progresses (Act 2), we're introduced to Grace, an investigative journalist who is driven and committed to uncovering the truth about the enigmatic Henry Hearst.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gus Poyet is relieved that fellow South American Sergio Aguero will not be lining up against Sunderland. The Argentina striker won a standing ovation at the Stadium of Light just four weeks ago when he scored twice in a 4-1 victory. Aguero, though, lasted just seven minutes of the following game at home to Everton and has not been seen since after suffering knee ligament damage. Sergio Aguero will be missing when Manchester City face Sunderland on New Year's Day Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is glad that his fellow South American won't be available Aguero earned himself a standing ovation after a stunning display at the Black Cats in December","completion":"Gus Poyet, Sunderland's manager, has expressed his relief that he won't have to face the incredibly talented Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero when the two teams meet on New Year's Day. Aguero, who hails from Argentina, has been sidelined due to knee ligament damage and his absence has been much talked-about in the build-up to the fixture. The South-American connection between Poyet and Aguero adds an interesting dimension to the situation, as both individuals have made significant contributions to their respective teams and are seen as crucial elements of their teams' success. Poyet, a Uruguayan former football player, has been Sunderland's manager since 2013, during which time he has managed to help the team avoid relegation and establish themselves in the Premier League. Aguero is no stranger to success either, having made a significant impact on Manchester City since joining the club in 2011. The Argentine striker has consistently been one of the league's top goal-scorers, making him a key figure in City's quest for domestic and European success. His presence in the team has often been the difference between victory and defeat, so it's no wonder that Poyet is somewhat relieved that Aguero won't be available for their New Year's Day match. Just four weeks prior to the fixture, Aguero managed to score two goals against Sunderland in a 4-1 victory at the Stadium of Light. His performance on that day was so impressive that even the home fans were compelled to give him a standing ovation in recognition of his talent and impact on the game. It's this sort of display that makes Aguero one of the most feared strikers in world football, and a player every manager would prefer not to have to deal with. It's important to note that while Aguero's absence may bring some relief to Poyet and his squad, it doesn't mean that they can afford to take their upcoming fixture lightly. Manchester City is still a formidable side even without their star striker, with the likes of Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, and Raheem Sterling all boasting impressive goal-scoring abilities. Poyet will have to devise a solid game plan and have his players well-prepared to face this talented squad. However, many may argue that Manchester City's attack does lose some of its potency without Aguero on the field, and this could provide Sunderland with opportunities to exploit their opponent's potential vulnerabilities. Poyet and his team will be looking to capitalize on their recent run of strong performances to secure valuable points for their ongoing league campaign. So, while Poyet has every reason to breathe a sigh of relief over Aguero's absence, the task at hand remains a challenging one for his Sunderland team. They must focus on the players who will be on the field for Manchester City and come up with a tactical approach that nullifies their strengths and exploits their weaknesses. As the old saying goes, \\"there is no room for complacency in football,\\" something that Poyet will surely be emphasizing to his players ahead of this crucial match."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: suppose less ice cube trays are gotten happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"Less Step-by-step explanation: 1. Get an ice cube tray - If fewer ice cube trays are gotten, there will be reduced capacity for ice cube production. 2. Fill the tray with cool water - Since less ice cube trays are filled, less water will be turned into ice cubes. 3. Place the tray in the freezer - The fewer trays placed in the freezer, the fewer ice cubes will be made. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - This step remains constant as it depends on time, not the number of ice cube trays. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer - With fewer trays, less ice cubes are produced and taken out of the freezer. 6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray - Again, fewer trays result in fewer ice cubes to pop out. The supposed perturbation (less ice cube trays) has a direct influence on the second effect (less ice cubes being made). With fewer ice cube trays, the overall production of ice cubes would decrease.

Answer the following question: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. Which region had fewer plants with an ability to change the way the regulated their stomates? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the region with fewer plants with an ability to change the way they regulated their stomates would be the eastern region of Austria. The eastern region experiences a wet climate, which means that plants in this area would be consistently exposed to an abundance of water. In contrast, the western region is exposed to drought conditions, which would require plants to adapt to water scarcity in order to survive. The study by Tombesi et al. shows that plants exposed to drought conditions have the capacity to form a \\"memory\\" of these harsh conditions, and subsequently, they develop a strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use by changing the way they regulate their stomates and adjusting their hydraulic safety margin. Since the eastern region has thriving vegetation due to its wet climate, the plants in this area would not face the selective pressure to adapt to drought conditions and, therefore, are less likely to have developed the ability to change their stomatal regulation patterns in response to water scarcity. In contrast, plants in the western region that have been consistently exposed to drought would be more likely to have developed this adaptive mechanism. In conclusion, the eastern region of Austria, which experiences a wet climate, would have fewer plants with the ability to change the way they regulate their stomates in response to drought conditions compared to the plants in the drought-prone western region of Austria."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

With diabetes, save a leg, save a life Each year in the U.S. diabetes results in the amputation of about 65,700 legs or feet. About 85% of those began with a diabetic foot ulcer. And for Dr. David Schwegman, the mission to educate people about the issue is personal. His father, a diabetic, had a foot ulcer that resulted in the amputation of his left leg, which contributed to his death, his son said. \\"He became a statistic,\\" Schwegman said. \\"He was one of the 50% of people that died within five years after having an amputation.\\" Diabetic foot ulcers, or DFUs, are usually located on the ball of the foot, the bottom of the big toe or sides of the feet. They can be a result of neuropathy, or nerve damage which leads to a loss of feeling. Although prevention is key, simply not treating an ulcer can lead to infection, particularly in the bone, and eventual loss of a limb. \\"If you have a DFU that leads to a major amputation, your risk of death in five years is greater is higher than that of breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,\\" Schwegman said. \\"This is a very, very serious health problem that has very serious risks if not dealt with properly and quickly,\\" the doctor said. \\"In order to do that, we really need to get the word out to both the patients and the physicians.\\" That's where the Save a Leg, Save a Life Foundation , or SALSAL, comes in. On Saturday, Schwegman, along with the Atlanta chapter of the national group, are offering free foot screenings as part of the American Diabetes Association's Health Expo. You can find an expo near you by visiting the American Diabetes Association's calendar for 2011. Diabetics can be screened for cuts, blisters, discoloration of feet, and any signs of bacteria or infections, conditions that can lead to foot ulcers. Right now, 18.8 million adults and children in the U.S. have diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 7 million people have undiagnosed diabetes and 79 million are prediabetic. Diabetics need to know that treating the ulcer early is the best way to get it healed. \\"If we're not treating them aggressively, the chances that they heal is actually very, very low,\\" Schwegman said. An important part of the evaluation of a person with a diabetic foot ulcer is a thorough vascular exam, since diabetics have a higher risk of having peripheral arterial disease. The condition results when circulation to the legs and feet is blocked or narrowed by calcifications. The poor blood flow can cause pain and discoloration in the feet- an increase in a red color, a dusky bluish color or sometimes the toes turn black and result in amputation. Dr. Desmond Bell, a wound care specialist and founder of SALSAL, recommends going straight to a podiatrist or wound care specialist if a cut, sore or wound does not heal in a week or two. Those with a history of diabetic foot ulcers should see a specialist immediately. Bell said several newer treatments are available to treat these wounds. None are a \\"silver bullet\\" for every single wound. SALSAL hopes to educate both physicians and the general public about them in order to prevent unnecessary amputations. Of the thousands of products available, only these three have evidence that they have increased wound healing rates: -Advanced skin cell substitutes include Dermagraft and Apligraf. These are similar in that they are derived from neonatal foreskins. -A growth factor gel, Regranex. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can also heal wounds and treat infections. Most exciting, Bell said, is peripheral revascularization, in which cardiologists and others, go into the groin similar to an angioplasty for the heart. Through this new procedure, doctors can open up blockages in the leg and restore blood flow. \\"It requires lots of doctors often times and it requires a motivated patient,\\" Schwegman said. \\"By saving their leg, it really does save their life.\\" Get a behind-the-scenes look at the latest stories from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen and the CNN Medical Unit producers.

What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Diabetes is a significant health concern in the U.S., with approximately 65,700 leg or foot amputations occurring each year due to the condition. Foot ulcers, which are prevalent amongst diabetics, often lead to limb amputations, and are an underappreciated risk. The Save a Leg, Save a Life Foundation (SALSAL) aims to educate both patients and physicians about the importance of early and aggressive treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. Screenings for foot ulcers can detect cuts, blisters, discoloration, and signs of infection, and it is essential that diabetics seek medical attention if their wounds do not heal within a week or two. Treating ulcers early can reduce the risk of infection and subsequent amputation, which has been linked to increased mortality rates.

Write a summary based on this article: Significantly, Lemon’s time with the Globetrotters paralleled the rise of the N.B.A. When he joined the team, the Globetrotters were still better known than the Knicks and the Boston Celtics and played for bigger crowds than they did. When he left, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were about to enter the N.B.A. and propel it to worldwide popularity. In between, the league became thoroughly accommodating to black players, competing with the Globetrotters for their services and eventually usurping the Trotters as the most viable employer of top black basketball talent. Partly as a result, the Globetrotters became less of a competitive basketball team and more of an entertainment troupe through the 1960s and ’70s. They became television stars, hosting variety specials and playing themselves on shows like “The White Shadow” and a made-for-TV “Gilligan’s Island” movie; they inspired a Saturday morning cartoon show. In Lemon’s early years with the team, as the Globetrotters took on local teams and challenged college all-star squads, they played to win, generally using straight basketball skills until the outcome was assured. But as time went on, for the fans who came to see them, the outcome was no longer the point. On Jan. 5, 1971, the Globetrotters were beaten in Martin, Tenn., by an ordinarily more obliging team, the New Jersey Reds. It was the first time they had lost in almost nine years, the end of a 2,495-game winning streak. But perhaps more remarkable than the streak itself was the fact that it ended at all, given that the Trotters’ opponents by then were generally forbidden to interfere with passes to Lemon in the middle or to interrupt the familiar reams. Lemon, as the stellar attraction, thrived in this environment, but he also became a lightning rod for troubles within the Globetrotter organization. As the civil rights movement gained momentum, the players’ antics on the court drew criticism from outside for reinforcing what many considered to be demeaning black stereotypes, and Lemon drew criticism from inside. Not only was he the leading figure in what some thought to be a discomforting resurrection of the minstrel show, he was also, by far, the highest-paid Globetrotter, and his teammates associated him more with management than with themselves. When the players went on strike for higher pay in 1971, Lemon, who negotiated his own salary, did not join them. After Saperstein died in 1965, the team changed hands several times, and in 1978, according to “Spinning the Globe: The Rise, Fall and Return to Greatness of the Harlem Globetrotters” (2005), by Ben Green, Lemon was dismissed after a salary dispute. He subsequently formed his own traveling teams — Meadowlark Lemon’s Bucketeers, the Shooting Stars and Meadowlark Lemon’s Harlem All-Stars — and continued performing into his 70s. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

He was born a second-class citizen in the Jim Crow South. His folks had split up, leaving his aunt and uncle to raise him -- a skinny boy with a funny name \\"not at the top of anyone's priority list,\\" as he later wrote. And, for a kid who looked forward to splurging 25 cents on Westerns and adventure flicks, there was no clear way out. Then, in the early 1940s, Lemon saw the newsreel that changed his life. \\"The newsreel on this particular Saturday was about a new kind of team -- a basketball team known as the Harlem Globetrotters,\\" he later wrote. \\"The players in the newsreel were unlike any I had ever seen. ... They laughed, danced and did ball tricks as they stood in a 'Magic Circle' and passed the ball to a jazzy tune called 'Sweet Georgia Brown.' How they could play!\\" He added: \\"There was one other thing that was different about them, though. They were all black men. The same color as me.\\" The man the world would come to know as Meadowlark Lemon -- who died Sunday at 83, Globetrotters spokesman Brett Meister said Lemon's wife and daughter confirmed -- dreamed what seemed like an impossible dream: to play for the Globetrotters and conquer the globe. Yet it came true. \\"Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen,\\" basketball great Wilt Chamberlain, Lemon's onetime teammate, said in a television interview shortly before his death in 1999, as the Times reported. \\"People would say it would be Dr. J or even Jordan. For me, it would be Meadowlark Lemon.\\" Lemon began with virtually nothing: a basketball hoop fashioned out of an onion sack and a wire coat hanger nailed to a tree behind a neighbor's house. His ball was an empty Carnation evaporated milk can salvaged from the garbage. Eventually those modest efforts led to greater things. Lemon was pulled out of a pickup game by a coach who saw his talent. The coach taught him the fundamentals -- including the hook shot that would make Lemon famous. Chicago Tribune Photo Freddie Neal and Meadowlark Lemon demonstrate their basketball skills. Freddie Neal and Meadowlark Lemon demonstrate their basketball skills. (Chicago Tribune Photo) (Chicago Tribune Photo) Lemon, however, was loath to give his mentor all the credit, saying he continued to work on the shot every day even after he perfected it. \\"I learned to perfect the hook shot because I was taught by the very best coach I've ever known,\\" he wrote in a 2010 memoir. \\"... It was me.\\" An all-state high school player, Lemon landed back in Wilmington after an unsuccessful stint playing at Florida A&M. He was considering joining the Army in the middle of the Korean War when a high-school coach got him his dream shot: a tryout with the Globetrotters in Raleigh, N.C. In front of 15,000 people, Lemon played for a quarter and a half and scored 12 points. Though the Globetrotters were impressed, the team wasn't ready for him. So Lemon enlisted and, while serving in Austria, tried out again when the Globetrotters visited Europe. The result: a 40-game contract for a European tour that turned into a career as the \\"Clown Prince of Basketball\\" of the franchise that spanned two decades. First lesson: Even on a team that valued spectacle over statistics, comedy isn't enough. \\"The comedians were the ones who got cut first,\\" Lemon said in 1977. \\"You first had to prove that you could play basketball, then you had to show that you could be funny.\\" Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen. People would say it would be Dr. J or even Jordan. For me, it would be Meadowlark Lemon. — Wilt Chamberlain Indeed, in the middle of the 20th century, the Globetrotters were more than a novelty act. When Lemon joined in 1954, the NBA had integrated just six years before. Owned by the very white, very Jewish Abe Saperstein -- who embraced the novel idea, missed by many of his contemporaries, that some black people could actually play basketball -- the team was a showcase for African-American players, including Chamberlain, who played for a year with Lemon. Though sometimes criticized for its buffoonish image -- for \\"Tomming for Abe,\\" as detractors put it -- in the civil rights era, the Globetrotters always had many defenders. \\"I think they've been a positive influence,\\" Jesse Jackson once said. \\"... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior.\\" \\"I knew when I joined the team that they were one of the most important institutions in the world,\\" Lemon wrote. \\"They had done more for the perception of black people and for the perception of America than almost anything you could think of.\\" He added: \\"Some people say that the Globetrotters kept the NBA in business in its early years.\\" Amid the race politics, there was room for levity -- a lot of it. In vaudevillian gags known as \\"reems,\\" the Globetrotters would torture referees, fake injuries, line up in football or baseball formations or douse one another with water. Lemon became the ringmaster of this circus, playing up to 10 games per week for 2 million paying customers around the world per year. With the Globetrotters and a subsequent comedy basketball teams he formed, he played in an East German swimming pool and a Mexican bullfighting ring. He played before two popes and met President Ronald Reagan. There was a cost. Lemon, the father of 10 children, missed a lot at home, where life was not always placid. Indeed, Lemon divorced his first wife, who was arrested in 1978 after a car chase between the unhappy couple ended with her stabbing him at 53rd Street and Second Avenue in New York. \\"I have a lot of people I need to apologize to,\\" Lemon said when he was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 2003, saying sorry to his family for the Globetrotters' punishing tour schedule. As proud as Lemon was of his performance on the court, he was perhaps prouder of his performance in another arena: He was ordained as a minister in 1986, according to his website. \\"I have been called the Clown Prince of Basketball, and an Ambassador of Good Will in Short Pants to the world, which is an honor,\\" he wrote. \\"To be a child of God is the highest honor anyone could have.\\" In the end, he laid credit for all he had accomplished on the court and off at the feet of the Almighty. \\"God planted that dream in my heart as I sat right there in the Ritz Theater,\\" Lemon wrote. \\"He gave me a relentless desire, determination, energy, and the talent to make my dream come true.\\" |||||","completion":"The article discusses the history of the Harlem Globetrotters, a basketball team that transformed from a competitive team into an entertainment troupe during the 1960s and 1970s.

When it touches the ground, a radiant, glowing yellow flower blossoms. It is capable of healing the sick and injured. An old crone named Gothel (Donna Murphy) finds the flower and discovers that, when she sings a certain song to it (\\"Flower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine. Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine\\") , it emits a power that restores her youth. Vain and possessive of the flower, Gothel hides it beneath a woven basket and regularly returns to it to keep herself young.Time goes by, and just a hop, skip and a boat ride away, the kingdom of Corona grows and prospers. The ruling king and queen desperately wish for a child and, when the queen becomes pregnant, the entire kingdom celebrates. However, the queen soon falls deathly ill.

Toilet: It's not advisable to store water in a toilet because it is not hygienic. Storing or preserving water in a clean environment is essential to avoid any potential health risks. B. Jar: A jar, specifically a clean, airtight jar, is a good place to store water. You can also store it in other similar containers like water bottles, jugs, or pitchers. Make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sterilized beforehand. The jars or any containers used should preferably be made of glass or food-grade plastic. Always keep them in a cool and dry place away from direct sunlight. C. Bridge: This is not a suitable option to store water due to exposure to environmental elements, pollutants and it can't be kept uncontaminated. D. Ocean: Storing water in the ocean is not feasible because you cannot keep it separate from the salt water, and consuming ocean water directly can lead to dehydration and health issues due to high salt content. E. Boot: This is also an unsuitable place to store water as it is unhygienic due to the typical usage of a boot - for wearing on the foot.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued.

Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

Possible answers: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","completion":"Yes, the premise \\"A bunch of people walking down a set of stairs\\" could be true if \\"The people are headed back to their offices.\\" This interpretation assumes that the people are walking down the stairs as a means of returning to their office spaces. In many office buildings, staircases serve as a way to navigate between floors and different areas of the building. Assuming that the individuals in question have some reason to use the stairs, it could be the most efficient means of getting to their offices depending on the building layout and their specific destinations. For example, if their offices are on a lower floor, walking down a set of stairs is a reasonable and direct option for getting there. In contrast, elevators might be used out of preference or necessity in certain situations. However, their availability might be limited, or people may choose to avoid them for various reasons, such as when they are crowded during peak times. In other instances, employees might prefer to take the stairs for exercise, personal preferences, or to accommodate a fear of elevators. Furthermore, the context provided does not directly contradict the premise in any way. It simply provides additional information about the people's destination, which helps to establish a purpose for their actions without negating the original premise. In conclusion, although various factors could influence the choice of taking the stairs instead of alternative means, such as elevators, the premise \\"a bunch of people walking down a set of stairs\\" is still true when \\"the people are headed back to their offices.\\" This is because using the stairs remains a plausible and reasonable option for people to reach their offices, even if it is not the only option available to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The footprints were found in two sedimentary layers, 1.5 million years old, near Ileret in the eastern African nation. \\"These rarest of impressions yielded information about soft tissue form and structure not normally accessible in fossilized bones. The Ileret footprints constitute the oldest evidence of an essentially modern human-like foot anatomy,\\" according to a team of anthropologists who detailed the discovery in the February 27 issue of the journal Science. The team, led by anthropologist Professor John W.K. Harris and an international group of colleagues, excavated the site between 2006 and 2008. Harris, who teaches at Rutgers University and the State University of New Jersey, is a member of the Center for Human Evolutionary Studies and directs the Koobi Fora Field Project. The ongoing excavation project is run by Rutgers in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya. Koobi Fora refers to a region around Koobi Fora Ridge, located on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. The area has been a rich resource for excavations. According to the authors of the journal article, there were three footprint trails in the upper sediment layer. Five meters deeper, another sediment surface preserved one trail of two prints and a single, smaller print, likely from a child. \\"In these specimens, the big toe is parallel to the other toes, unlike that of apes where it is separated in a grasping configuration useful in the trees. The footprints show a pronounced human-like arch and short toes, typically associated with an upright bipedal stance,\\" the scientists said. \\"The size, spacing and depth of the impressions were the basis of estimates of weight, stride and gait, all found to be within the range of modern humans.\\" The size and other characteristics of the prints led the authors to conclude the prints belonged to the hominid Homo ergaster, or early Homo erectus. This is the first hominid to have had the same body proportions -- longer legs and shorter arms -- as modern Homo sapiens. Other hominid fossil footprints dating to 3.6 million years ago were discovered in 1978 by Mary Leakey at Laetoli, Tanzania. \\"These are attributed to the less advanced Australopithecus afarensis, a possible ancestral hominid.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose tenure in in Mühlhausen was from 1706 to 1708? Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Prääsä. At this time it became obvious that there weren't enough troops to complete the goals of the expedition. A new round of recruiting 2000 new volunteers was started and Mannerheim made Aarne Sihvo the new commander of the expedition. Major Paavo Talvela's regiment started an attack aimed at Petrozavodsk on June 20, but was beaten by Red Army and Finnish Red Guard forces just outside the town. The British troops that operated along the Murmansk railroad were quite close by, but did not participate. The Finns had hoped that the Karelian population would have joined the troops as volunteers but only a few did and their morale was never very high. The initiative now passed to the Bolsheviks. On June 26 over 600 Finns of the Red Officer School in Saint Petersburg made a landing at Vitele across Lake Ladoga behind the Finnish lines. The southern group was forced to retreat to Finland after suffering heavy losses. Talvela's group was also forced to retreat back to Finland.

Sir Edward Matheson, a highly influential and wealthy merchant banker, is known for his ruthless business tactics and insatiable desire for wealth and power. His lavish home, Matheson Manor, is a testament to his success and opulent taste. In a small, struggling town, a young writer named Tom, aspires to rise above his family's financial predicament by investigating and unravelling the life and secrets of Sir Edward Matheson. He dreams of creating a masterpiece that will make a difference in society and bring him success. During his research, he meets Lily, a resourceful and beautiful woman who provides him with valuable information while secretly infiltrating Sir Edward's social circle. As Tom and Lily uncover the ruthless practices of Sir Edward, they learn that he holds immense power over the political, economic, and social affairs in London. They discover that Sir Edward has risen to his position by crushing competitors and ruining lives, all while maintaining a facade of high-class decorum and philanthropy. Deep within Matheson Manor lies a mysterious chamber that holds the key to Sir Edward's most sinister secrets. Tom and Lily must infiltrate a prestigious ball at the Manor to find a way to access this chamber. During the ball, Lily is recognized by one of Sir Edward's associates, and they are forced to make a daring escape, barely managing to flee with important documents. These documents, however, paint an incomplete picture, and Tom realizes that he needs to confront Sir Edward himself to get the full story. As Tom and Lily prepare for the final confrontation, they fall in love, strengthening their resolve to bring Sir Edward's crimes to light. In a climactic scene, Tom confronts Sir Edward inside the mysterious chamber, only to discover that Sir Edward is not the ultimate mastermind. He is instead a puppet of a far more powerful, shadowy figure who wields power over the entire British Empire. Faced with this revelation and fearing for their lives, Tom and Lily must make a difficult decision: expose the truth about Sir Edward and face the wrath of the true mastermind or escape with their lives and continue the fight from the shadows. The film ends with Tom and Lily choosing to carry on their work secretly, setting the stage for a sequel where they work to bring down the mysterious and dangerous organization they have uncovered. The Mastermind of Matheson Manor is a thrilling period drama that highlights themes of corruption, power, and overcoming adversity, all while depicting the lavish and sophisticated lifestyle of the Victorian era in England."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under).

Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water.

The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Which farm caused more fertilizer to end up in ponds? Answer:","completion":"Fiddle farm caused more fertilizer to end up in ponds because it used an abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm didn't use any of those substances. The rain dissolving the fertilizer from Fiddle farm would lead to more runoff carrying it away into bodies of water, such as ponds, contributing to increased algae growth and potential dead zones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process for converting wind energy into electricity in a wind turbine involves transforming the generated electrical energy into a usable format and transmitting it to the power grid. Here's a detailed description of how this process works: 1. Electromagnetic induction: When the rotor, containing magnets, spins inside the core surrounded by wire loops (also called stator windings or coils), it generates a magnetic field that changes continuously. This changing magnetic field induces an alternating current (AC) to flow in the wire loops according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The electricity generated in this manner is the primary output of the wind turbine. 2. Voltage regulation and transformation: The electricity produced by the generator is often at a relatively low voltage, and its frequency might vary depending on the rotational speed of the wind turbine. To make this electricity suitable for the power grid, it must be transformed into a more stable form. Voltage regulators and transformers are used for this purpose. Voltage regulators help in maintaining a constant voltage output, and transformers are used to step up the voltage to a level suitable for long-distance transmission through power lines. 3. AC to DC conversion and grid integration: In some cases, the generated AC is first converted to direct current (DC) using rectifiers. This DC is then converted back to AC using inverters at a specific frequency and voltage level that matches the grid requirements. Grid-integrated wind turbines use advanced control systems and power electronics to synchronize the electricity produced with the power grid's specifications for the smooth and stable flow of electricity. 4. Power transmission and distribution: Once the electricity has been transformed and adjusted to the required voltage and frequency levels, it is transferred to the electrical grid through transmission lines. These transmission lines carry the electricity to various substations, where the voltage may be stepped down further as needed for distribution to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. 5. Monitoring and control: Most modern wind turbines have sophisticated sensors and remote monitoring systems that allow operators to observe and control the wind turbine's performance in real-time. These systems provide data on wind speed, wind direction, power output, and various other parameters to ensure optimal efficiency, safety, and prevent potential issues. In summary, the last step of the wind energy conversion process involves transforming the generated electrical energy into a usable format, integrating it with the power grid, transmitting the electricity through substations and distribution networks, and monitoring the turbine's performance for optimal efficiency and safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Question: \\"How many regents where there and how many had ambitions of their own?\\" Answer: \\"10\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer provided is incorrect.

Both sides demonstrate their good will, which suggests a willingness to cooperate and potentially overcome hurdles or disputes that may arise. However, the speaker emphasizes the importance of putting an end to forced relocation. Forced relocation can refer to a wide array of circumstances, including the displacement of people due to various social, economic, or political factors.

We have two terms with the variable z on the right side: 697*z and -78*z. We can combine them by subtracting 78*z from 697*z. 697*z - 78*z = 619*z So the equation becomes: -16713 = 619*z Step 2: Isolate z. To find the value of z, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 619. (-16713) / 619 = (619*z) / 619 Step 3: Simplify the left side of the equation. Divide -16713 by 619. -16713 / 619 ≈ -27 Step 4: Simplify the right side of the equation. Since we divided both sides of the equation by the same number, the 619 cancels out on the right side, leaving only z. z ≈ -27 So the solution to the equation -16713 = 697*z - 78*z is z ≈ -27."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

THE GALIMAFRE Speats and raxes, speats and raxes, speat and raxes Lord Somerville's billet Never wont to let the grass grow under his feet, Henry of Navarre was impatient of awaiting his troops at Pont de Dronne, and proposed to hasten on to Quinet, as a convenient centre for collecting the neighbouring gentry for conference. Thus, early on Monday, a party of about thirty set forth on horseback, including the Ribaumonts, Rayonette being perched by turns in front of her father or mother, and the Duke de Quinet declaring that he should do his best to divide the journey into stages not too long for Philip, since he was anxious to give his mother plenty of time to make preparations for her royal guest. He had, however, little reckoned on the young King's promptitude. The first courier he had dispatched was overtaken at a _cabaret_ only five leagues from Pont de Dronne, baiting his horse, as he said; the second was found on the road with a lame horse; and the halt a day's journey remained beyond it. The last stage had been ridden, much to the Duke's discontent, for it brought them to a mere village inn, with scarcely any accommodation. The only tolerable bed was resigned by the King to the use of Philip, whose looks spoke the exhaustion of which his tongue scorned to complain. So painful and feverish a night ensued that Eustacie was anxious that he should not move until the Duke should, as he promised, send a mule litter back for him; but this proposal he resented; and in the height of his constitutional obstinacy, appeared booted and spurred at the first signal to mount. 1.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Response: \\"The Ottomans\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Question: President Donald Trump made a fresh appeal Friday for support to arm some teachers to help stem mass shootings targeting schools. Trump's pitch came during a speech before a friendly conservative crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting near Washington. Trump spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Although a new experience for Trump, it is a situation many of his predecessors are all too familiar with. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all faced similar tragedies while in office. They also dealt with political pressures in the aftermath demanding action. Trump is also beginning to see why presidents are often frustrated when they try to bridge what pollsters and political pundits often refer to as the great divide over guns in the United States. In the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Clinton sought to calm the nation. \\"We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons,\\" he said. In 2007, it was left to President Bush to lead the grieving at Virginia Tech after a gunman killed 32 people before committing suicide. \\"May God bless and keep the souls of the lost, and may his love touch all of those who suffer in grief,\\" he said at an on campus memorial service. And in 2012, an emotional President Obama wiped away a tear as he addressed the nation in the wake of the massacre of grade-school students in Newtown, Connecticut. \\"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the last few years. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old,\\" he said. Trump has expressed sympathy for the victims and families in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But he has also been forceful in pushing for solutions, including the controversial idea of... Question: What years was the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado?

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. Answer this question please: Which brother was more at risk for atherosclerosis? A:","completion":"A: Liam, the brother with high cholesterol, is more at risk for atherosclerosis. This is because high cholesterol levels can lead to the formation of plaques in the arteries, as mentioned in the background information provided. These plaques can then restrict blood flow, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and its associated complications, such as high blood pressure, lowered oxygen supply, and heart attacks. On the other hand, Rudy has normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which suggests a lower risk for developing atherosclerosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The hypothesis can be deduced from the premise, as both statements share the core idea - a girl standing on a soccer field. The premise provides more specific details about the girl's appearance (small white-skinned girl in a pink top and jeans), while the hypothesis doesn't contain any specifics about the girl's appearance. However, the main aspect of the girl being on a soccer field remains consistent between both statements. Therefore, if the premise is accurate, the hypothesis is also correct. It is important to note that while the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, the hypothesis alone might not provide all the information or context given in the premise. The hypothesis is a more general statement, while the premise is a specific scenario or a detailed description. In summary, if the premise states that a small white-skinned girl in a pink top and jeans is standing on a soccer field, it is true to deduce that a girl is standing on the soccer field, which is the hypothesis.

The grave and evidence of a 13th Century monastery were uncovered when archaeologists were called to an Edinburgh Old Town building site. An elaborate sandstone slab, with carvings of a Calvary Cross and ornate sword, marked the grave. This find has the potential to be one of the most significant and exciting archaeological discoveries in the city for many years Richard Lewis, Edinburgh Council culture convener The car park was cleared to build a new Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation. As part of low carbon measures for the University of Edinburgh scheme, work was being carried out in the former car park to create a rainwater harvesting tank for the new building. It was already known the area had been the site of the 18th Century Old High School, the 16th Century Royal High School and the 13th Century Blackfriars Monastery. Along with the knight or nobleman's grave and skeleton, the excavation has revealed the exact location of the monastery, which was founded in 1230 by Alexander II (King of Scotland 1214-49) and destroyed during the Protestant Reformation in 1558. Richard Lewis, the City of Edinburgh council culture convener, said it was hoped more would be found out about the remains, but the grave had already been dated to the 13th Century. \\"This find has the potential to be one of the most significant and exciting archaeological discoveries in the city for many years, providing us with yet more clues as to what life was like in Medieval Edinburgh,\\" he added. The project's archaeological services have been provided by Edinburgh-based Headland Archaeology. The archaeologist who found the grave, Ross Murray, had studied at the University of Edinburgh on a site only yards from where the find was made. Mr Murray said: \\"We obviously knew the history of the High School Yards site while we were studying here but I never imagined I would be back here to make such an incredible discovery.\\" ||||| York church leader abused in Richard III burial row LONDON — The head of historic British church York Minster has contacted police after receiving hate mail, intensifying the row over where the recently-discovered remains of King Richard III should be buried. York lawmaker Hugh Bayley told parliament that the Dean of York, Vivienne Faull, had been caught in the crossfire between those who want the former monarch buried in York, and those who wish for him to be interred in the central England city of Leicester, where his remains were found. \\"I received many letters and emails from members of the public about this, supporting burial in York,\\" Bayley said. \\"Most are thoughtful and well argued and based on scientific facts but some are frankly inflammatory and talking yesterday to the Dean of York, some that she has received at the minster are so extreme that she has referred the correspondence to the police. \\"I would say to everybody - 'calm down. Let's all respect the memory of a former king of our country',\\" he added. Scientists confirmed in February that a skeleton found under a car park was that of the controversial king, in a bizarre end to a 500-year-old historical mystery. DNA from the bones matched that of descendants of the king's sister, while the skeleton had the twisted spine and battle injuries consistent with contemporary accounts, said researchers from the University of Leicester. Nine of his descendants urged the government to return the remains of the king to York, his royal house, for a \\"formal and ceremonial\\" burial. But the government has said the decision lies with the University of Leicester, who said he will be interred at Leicester Cathedral. Richard grew up near the northern city of York and funded part of the city's gated walls. A spokesman for York Minster said: \\"York Minster has received a number of letters about Richard III, a small number of these have been abusive. \\"These have been passed to the Minster Police, and they continue to monitor the situation closely.\\" The discovery has caused huge excitement among historians, as it provides firm evidence about a monarch whose life has been shrouded in controversy since his death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. According to historical accounts, Richard's body was transported naked and bloody on the back of a pack horse to Leicester before being buried in an unmarked grave at Greyfriars, a Franciscan friary.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\".

Menonville appreciated Burke's work so much that he requested more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. In response, Burke published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly in April 1791. In his letter, Burke called for an external intervention to reverse the French Revolution. He criticized the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke acknowledged that Rousseau occasionally displayed \\"a considerable insight into human nature,\\" he primarily criticized the philosopher's ideas and character. Burke attributed Rousseau's folly to his extreme vanity, which he believed bordered on madness. He used Rousseau's own autobiography, Confessions, as evidence of his life filled with \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" and devoid of any virtues or good actions. The British statesman saw Rousseau as a contradictory figure who advocated for universal benevolence but held contempt for his own kin. Burke pointed out the dichotomy between Rousseau's theories on benevolence and his decision to abandon his own children to a foundling hospital as an example of his hypocrisy. It is important to note that Burke had connections to Rousseau's acquaintances, as the British statesman was a friend of David Hume, the Scottish philosopher with whom Rousseau had stayed during his visit to Britain in 1766–67. Overall, Thibault de Menonville praised Burke's Reflections and wanted more of his insightful thoughts on the revolution and related subjects. In response, Burke provided his perspective on Rousseau's role in the revolution, critiquing the philosopher's vanity, hypocrisy, and influence on revolutionary France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - louisiana - oregon - pet store - tropical forest - blue ridge mountains The answer is \\"oregon\\" because Answer:","completion":"Oregon and Blue Ridge Mountains are the correct answers. Oregon is home to several mountains like the Cascade Range, Klamath Mountains, and others where various species of snakes can inhabit. The state has about 15 species of snakes, including the common garter snake, northwestern garter snake, western rattlesnake, and others that could be found in its mountainous regions. Additionally, the Blue Ridge Mountains, which extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania, also have a diverse range of snake species who inhabit the mountains. Some of these include the timber rattlesnake, northern copperhead, eastern cottonmouth, and several others. A pet store could theoretically house a snake that could thrive in a mountainous environment, however, it's not a geographical location where one would naturally find a snake. Louisiana, while it does have snakes, is largely flat and does not feature any notable mountain ranges where one might find a snake. A tropical forest might contain snakes, but it's not typically what one would think of when imagining a mountainous environment. The conditions in a tropical forest would be remarkably different from a mountainous region. Remember, the exact kind of snake you might find could depend on the specific mountain in question, its elevation, climate, and the particular ecosystem present there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sandra Bullock not first - or even fifth - choice for 'Gravity' LOS ANGELES – Listen for gasps in the \\"Gravity\\" audience when 50-year-old leading lady Sandra Bullock first slips out of her space suit and shows off her flawless figure in a tiny crop top and itty bitty shorts. And then know her body isn't the only miracle -- her being in the movie at all was a long-shot at best. Originally written for Angelina Jolie, the lead female role was reportedly offered to a bevy of much younger stars. In mid-2010, Marion Cotillard, 38, screen tested. A couple of months later Scarlett Johansson, 28, and Blake Lively, 26, were being linked to the movie. When director Alfonso Cuarón got the green light from Warner Bros., he offered the part to Natalie Portman, 32, without a screen test. But she passed. Which is when Oscar winner Bullock entered the picture. And even she admits she was a weird choice for a movie about an astronaut floating helplessly in space, but for a totally different reason. MORE: How Sandra Bullock trained for weightlessness. “I don’t like to fly. I’ve never been a good flyer,\\" Bullock told FOX411. “I have a lot of friends that have permanent nail marks in their arms… The moaning that comes from me when there is turbulence. It’s awkward for everyone around.” Luckily for Bullock, filming \\"Gravity\\" didn’t require any actual soaring. Instead Bullock, like her co-star George Clooney, was harnessed with around a dozen carbon-thin wires across her body to train, and tied into a rig inside a tailor-made cube adorned by over four thousand LED light bulbs. The bulbs could simulate whatever brightness, speed and color were required to capture the light of Earth below and sun in the distance as her astronaut character spun and slammed into stuff “The toughest aspect (of filming) was gravity. We had to have the actors floating around the way they would react in space and there is no resistance in space and we needed to invent a new set of tools to achieve that,” Cuarón explained. “The journey of inventing those tools is what took a while.” Four-and-a-half years to be exact. And while the process wasn’t always a walk (or rather or whirl) in the park, it did teach Bullock a few extra life lessons. “It was frustrating, scary, exhilarating, humbling… But mostly, it just pissed you off. It took away all your control, and your crutches and forced you to (surrender),” she added. “But I have gotten to that point in my life where I know I am absolutely out of control, and if anything should happen other than what I do, than that is all I have got. And even if I am not always controllable.” “Gravity” opens in theaters Friday Summary:","completion":"Sandra Bullock was not the first choice for the lead role in \\"Gravity,\\" as the part was initially written for Angelina Jolie. Other actresses considered for the role included Marion Cotillard, Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively, and Natalie Portman. Bullock eventually got the part and filmed it with the help of carbon-thin wires and a specially designed cube adorned with over 4,000 LED bulbs to simulate weightlessness and space conditions. \\"Gravity\\" took four and a half years to create the unique special effects, and Bullock described the experience as \\"frustrating, scary, exhilarating, (and) humbling.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. Paragraph: Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists. Bill knows everything there is to know about most ants except the Leafcutter ants. Chris studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years now. They are good friends and exchange ideas often over a pint of beer. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend studied more about fungus eating ants?","completion":"Chris studied more about fungus eating ants, specifically Leafcutter ants, which feed exclusively on a fungus that grows within their colonies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coffee or an energy drink will give you the boost you will need to make it through the night. However, don’t guzzle it down all at once. It can help you stay more alert if you space it out throughout the night. Some studies show caffeine can increase your focus. Most people need about a 5-ounce cup of coffee or caffeinated beverage to get the necessary boost. That’s about 100 milligrams of caffeine. Caffeine will wear off in a couple hours, and it takes about a half hour for you to feel its effects. You can also find caffeine pills in 100 or 200 mg doses that you can buy across the counter. Be aware that drinking a lot of caffeine can also make you jittery and have some side effects. When you stop drinking the caffeinated beverage, your body might crash, making you feel extra tired. If you don't drink coffee, eat apples. They have enough sugar to keep you awake. Some foods will give you more of an energy boost than others. If you’re pulling an all-nighter, you need to give your body some fuel. So don’t skip meals. Eat something that has protein, fiber, or complex carbs in it. For example, a sandwich with a glass of milk or granola with fruit are good choices. You should also drink a lot of water. Staying hydrated is a natural energy boost. Whole grains, tuna fish, mushrooms, nuts, eggs, chicken and beef are also high-energy feeds. Empty calorie junk food filled with sugar could set you up for a sugar crash, so the energizing effects are too temporary. Choose natural ways to stay up all night, not ways that could put you at risk. Be very careful what you put into your body. Although teenagers probably shouldn’t be drinking it anyway, (unless they’re of legal drinking age for their area), drinking alcohol causes drowsiness. Don’t use drugs that are regularly prescribed as stimulants to pull an all-nighter. It’s not worth damaging your body or taking the risk. Such behaviors can be exceptionally dangerous and even illegal. Sometimes it’s unavoidable (a one-time thing). However, organizing your life differently may ensure you don’t have to do it regularly. Work on study habits. People get overwhelmed when they think of everything they have to do at once. Create a checklist. Set aside a certain amount of time to study at the same time each day, so you get into a routine. Research shows that teenagers’ sleep habits are different than those of adults. Young people's bodies might tell them to go to stay awake later. This is a natural occurrence. Clearing your mind by getting off the computer, smartphone or video games will help.

In conclusion, I believe Markers is a fantastic app for artists who enjoy digital drawing, but there's still some room for improvement. That's why I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis? from the following article ? Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...

UPDATED:. 20:20 EST, 7 March 2013. A Mexican man has pleaded no contest to beheading a man in Arizona who police say stole drugs from the El Chapo drug trafficking organization launching the grisly attack authorities fear to be spreading across the U.S. border. Crisantos Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, 39, entered his plea on Monday to second-degree murder in the death of Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy, 38, who was killed at a Phoenix apartment in 2010 after allegedly tracked by three hit men sent from Mexico. Police believe Cota-Monroy's gruesome killing was intended to send a message that anyone who betrays the traffickers will get the same treatment. Slaughter: From left, Isai Aguilar Morales, 22, Crisantos Moroyoqui, 39, and Jose David Castro Reyes, 25, who were all in the U.S. illegally are linked to the Arizona stabbing and beheading. But the case has been cited as an. extreme example of Mexican cartel violence spilling over the border,. with cartel killings in the U.S. rare due to fear of attention from. American authorities. Mexico has been plagued by decapitations in the drug war against cartels. Headless. bodies have been dangled from bridges by their feet; severed heads have. been sent to victims' family members and government officials; and bags. of heads have been dropped off in high-profile locations. The Arizona beheading also factored into the state's contentious immigration debate. A month before the October beheading,. Republican Gov. Jan Brewer drew criticism for claiming that headless. bodies were being found in the Arizona desert as she sought to bolster. her argument for confronting the state's immigration woes. She later backtracked on those claims, but said such violence in the broader border region is cause enough for alarm. Tracked down: Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy, left, was beheaded in a Phoenix apartment after the hit men were allegedly sent from Mexico by the PEI-Estatales/El Chapo drug cartel, their leader right, to kill him. George. W. Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William & Mary in. Williamsburg, Va., said he isn't aware of any other cartel-related. beheadings in the United States and noted that cartel killings in the. United States are rare, citing bosses of the criminal groups not wanting. to draw attention from American authorities. Ramona. Sanchez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in. Arizona, said the state hasn't seen a cartel killing in the last few. years and is experiencing fewer cases of smugglers stealing trafficking. loads from each other. Arizona has served as a hub for immigrant and drug smugglers for many years. Forty-four. percent of all marijuana seizures near the nation's borders were made. in the Border Patrol's Tucson sector from October 2011 through September. 2012. Ms Sanchez said such drug rip-offs are now infrequent in Arizona, while in the past they were somewhat common. Prayers: A man who overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking before the killing heard them discuss La Santa Muerte, a Mexican folk saint, pictured, who counts cartel members among its devotees. ‘There are consequences to be paid,’ Ms Sanchez said of drug rip-offs. ‘Those kinds of issues aren't resolved in a court. They are resolved with violence.’ A police report that cites Border Patrol intelligence said Cota-Monroy had stolen 400 pounds of marijuana and some meth from the PEI-Estatales/El Chapo drug trafficking organization. Cota-Monroy told the cartel that the Border Patrol had seized the drugs, but the cartel learned the truth and hired men to kidnap and kill him in Nogales, Mexico. But Cota-Monroy was able to talk his way out of being killed, saying he'd pay back the money and use his house for collateral, the report said. It turned out that the house wasn't Cota-Monroy's, and he fled to the Phoenix area, leading the cartel to hire assassins to go to Arizona, befriend Cota-Monroy and kill him. Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, a day laborer who had been living in the apartment complex where the killing occurred, is the only man to be charged in Cota-Monroy's death. Three men who were with Cota-Monroy around the time of his death are believed to have fled to Mexico. Jerry Cobb, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which prosecuted the case, said on Thursday that no witnesses or evidence definitively placed the three men at the scene of the murder. The police report said a rival drug cartel, the Beltran-Leyva organization, was possibly planning on killing the three men. Cota-Monroy was reportedly a mid-level member of that drug cartel, for which his brother also worked. Authorities who responded to the shooting say Moroyoqui-Yocupicio was wearing pants covered in blood. Moroyoqui-Yocupicio's lawyer, James Hann, had argued authorities had no evidence that Moroyoqui-Yocupicio actually killed the victim and had said his client was intoxicated and didn't remember anything and didn't know the victim. A message left for Hann at midday on Thursday wasn’t immediately returned. Sentencing for Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, who faces 10 to 16 years in prison, is set for May 8. Prosecutors say a man who lived in the apartment where the killing took place overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking shortly before the killing about La Santa Muerte, a Mexican folk saint who counts cartel members among its devotees. The underground saint, which is not recognized by the Catholic Church, has gained in popularity in the U.S. among immigrants, artists and gay activists.

Answer:","completion":"The Germans, also known as Germanic peoples, are an ethnic group originating from Northern Europe. Their early history can be traced back to the Iron Age, specifically to the region known today as Scandinavia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Germanic tribes began to migrate and expand throughout Europe during the later Iron Age and early Roman period, eventually forming distinct cultures and languages. The Germanic peoples were initially identified by the Romans as a group of tribes living in the area that is now Germany, Denmark, and southern Scandinavia. During the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes often came into contact and conflict with the Romans. The most famous encounter was the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, when Roman legions were decisively defeated by the Germans under the leadership of Arminius. Over the centuries, the Germanic tribes continued to expand and migrate across Europe, some settling in the British Isles, while others moved eastwards into what is now modern-day Poland and Ukraine. During the Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, Germanic tribes played crucial roles in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the establishment of new kingdoms, such as the Visigoths in Spain, Ostrogoths and Lombards in Italy, and the Franks in France and Germany. Germany, as we know it today, gradually began to take shape in the Early Middle Ages following the Treaty of Verdun in 843 AD. The treaty divided the Frankish Realm into three regions, with the eastern part forming the basis of what would eventually become the Holy Roman Empire, dominated by Germanic rulers and their local territories. This entity evolved over centuries, eventually leading to the formation of modern Germany, which was formally united in 1871 under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. In summary, the Germans are a Germanic ethnic group originating from Northern Europe, with their early history rooted in the Iron Age and the Roman Empire. Over centuries, Germanic tribes have played a major role in shaping European history, with modern Germany emerging in the late 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The oils are among a raft of pictures of celebrities painted by John Bratby, one of Britain's most acclaimed artists of the 1950s and 1960s. He fell out of fashion in the 1970s and moved to Hastings in East Sussex. The town's Jerwood Gallery has brought the paintings of McCartney together in the first retrospective exhibition of Bratby's work. The gallery, in collaboration with Bratby's family, launched an appeal to owners of his work to submit them for the show. More than 300 entries were submitted, including the portraits of McCartney owned by collectors in London and Plymouth. In all, Bratby - who was known for his \\"kitchen sink realism\\" style - painted three portraits of McCartney. It is believed the musician himself owns the third. Actor and comedian Michael Palin, who was invited to sit for Bratby in 1981, is among those who contributed portraits to the exhibition. Palin said: \\"He wrote to me and said 'Come down to Hastings one day - it will only take an afternoon'. \\"He worked very solidly for about three-and-a -alf hours then he said, 'The work is done - it's yours for £700'. \\"I didn't like it at all but I paid the money. \\"I really like it now and actually I am rather fond of his work.\\" Other paintings in the exhibition include still lifes, pop art and domestic scenes.

No wonder that luxury makeup companies are unveiling a trove of gold products for nails, lips, eyes and the face. And while they are surely festive, most are not too extreme for day, in finishes that lean more toward a shimmery flourish than a bold statement. “It’s one of those universal tones that looks really gorgeous on dark skin as well as on light skin,” the makeup artist Polly Osmond said. “A gold eyeliner and gold eye shadow works across the board.” This new batch of gilded products is already proving popular. Gold 001, a deeply saturated makeup pigment created by the makeup artist Pat McGrath, sold all 1,000 of its numbered packages in just over six minutes when it was introduced online last month. Although Ms. McGrath applied it to intense effect on the models’ lips at the Prada show in September, it can be worn more sheerly and elsewhere on the face. Lancôme’s newly released selection of gold makeup is highly wearable, including an eye shadow palette of coordinated metallic shades, two glistening liquid eyeliners and a clear topcoat for nails filled with chunky shards of glitter. There is also a mascara, Hypnôse Stardust Golden Top Coat, that looks like liquid tinsel in the tube but is surprisingly subtle. It is designed to be applied to the ends of your eyelashes. The golden tint of Tom Ford Lash Tips Mascara is paler and thus more pronounced on dark lashes, but the color flatters most eye colors. Introduced this month, it has a tiny brush that takes the challenge out of application, even on tiny hairs along the lower lashes. Dior Beauty’s State of Gold holiday makeup collection includes Blazing, a shimmery eye shadow, and a softly gilt lip gloss called, appropriately enough, Sparkle. Chanel’s seasonal collection also has gold items, like Le Top Coat in Lamé Rouge Noir, an unusual product for nails that combines glitter, clear polish and Chanel’s distinctive deep red, also known as Vamp, in a single bottle. (A quick shake mixes the components; when applied, nails get a hint of both color and golden shine.) An especially versatile option comes from Hourglass. Its Ambient Lighting Edit compact has six contouring powders, including a gilded highlighter that will be available on its own in January, when the holiday season is but a memory.","completion":"Glistening Golden Glam: Embracing Luxury Gold Makeup Trends for the Holiday Season"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who did Tony bribe to murder Margot? Title: Dial M for Murder Movie plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer.

Meanwhile, Vandal Savage plots to exterminate the greater part of the human population and start a new civilization; he discreetly gave the technology to the Gang for testing purposes. To ensure the Justice League cannot stop him, Savage hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman to incapacitate his League teammates, in case they go rogue. Savage assembles Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, who all have personal vendettas against the heroes and pays them to simultaneously attack using the stolen plans, albeit altered to be lethal. When the supervillains agree, he welcomes them to the Legion of Doom. The villains each do their part to take out each member of the Justice League: Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is informed by Alfred Pennyworth that the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been exhumed and are missing. At his parents' graves, Bruce is ambushed by Bane, who gains the upper hand and renders Bruce unconscious. Bruce is buried alive in his father's coffin; he is left a tape recorder with a message from Bane taunting him, which motivates him to break out of the coffin.

She was the real-life stepmother of David Cassidy, who played her on-screen son Keith Partridge, and was married to Jack Cassidy (David's father) from 1956 to 1975.

The answer is:","completion":"No, that statement would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"who was the 16th president of the United States?\\" as it does not specifically answer the question. Instead, a more detailed and appropriate response would be: The 16th president of the United States was Abraham Lincoln, who served from March 4, 1861, until his assassination on April 15, 1865. Born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Kentucky, Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer and a skilled orator. He is most notably remembered for his Emancipation Proclamation, which declared slaves in Confederate-held territory to be free, and for his role in preserving the Union during the American Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was a leader of the newly-formed Republican Party, becoming president after a contentious and divided election in 1860. As the 16th president, he faced the monumental challenge of steering the country through a period of great upheaval and conflict. Lincoln has been credited with a number of important accomplishments during his time in office, including the passage of the Homestead Act, which granted 160 acres of land to settlers for a small fee, and the Morrill Act, which provided federal funding for the creation of land-grant colleges. However, his lasting legacy is often tied to his stance on slavery. Issued on January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation was a crucial turning point in the Civil War and was a precursor to the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment, which formally abolished slavery in the United States in December 1865. Though the Proclamation did not immediately free all slaves, it changed the nature of the conflict from a battle for the preservation of the Union to a fight for human freedom. Tragically, Abraham Lincoln's time in office was cut short when he was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., just days after the end of the Civil War. While his life and presidency were marked by deep divisions and turmoil, he remains one of the most admired and influential figures in American history. Lincoln's dedication to the principles of liberty and equality for all, as well as his stoic leadership during one of the most challenging periods in the nation's history, has earned him a lasting place in the American consciousness and an indelible impact on the course of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:","completion":"Title: Maximize Savings and Convenience by Shopping Smart: Email Lists, Online Shopping, Seasonal Buys, and Weekly Rotations Introduction The rise of technology in the 21st century has brought about significant changes to the retail landscape, with online shopping at the forefront of this transformation. Consumers now have access to a wealth of products and services at the touch of a button, and with this convenience comes new ways to save money and maximize the shopping experience. This article will explore some exceptional shopping tactics that can help you make the most of your shopping, from signing up to email lists to establish a weekly rotation for purchases. Get on email lists and shop online when possible One of the first steps to becoming a savvy shopper is to sign up for email lists from your favorite retailers. By doing this, you will be notified of exclusive deals, discounts, and sales that may not be accessible to the general public. This includes limited-time offers, members-only promotions, and clearance sales. Additionally, email subscriptions frequently come with a sign-up bonus, ranging from 10% to 20% off your next purchase. By being part of these mailing lists, you benefit from instant knowledge about money-saving opportunities, allowing you to plan your shopping accordingly. Shopping online has revolutionized the retail experience, offering consumers a wide array of choices, competitive pricing, and the convenience of purchasing products from the comfort of their home. Many online retailers compete for your business by offering lower prices than brick-and-mortar stores, free shipping, or additional discounts via coupon codes and promotions. When you opt for online shopping, always compare prices, read customer reviews, and look for additional discount opportunities. Embrace the growing e-commerce landscape, and your wallet will thank you. Shop seasonally Another essential tactic to maximize your savings is shopping seasonally. Retailers typically stock their shelves depending on the season and partake in major discounts on seasonal items as they strive to sell out their inventory. One example is shopping for winter clothing at the end of winter, when retail stores often drastically reduce their prices as they prepare for the arrival of spring collections. This principle can also be applied to purchasing groceries by focusing on purchasing fresh produce at the peak of their season, which typically leads to lower prices and better flavor. Shopping seasonally allows you to find great deals on quality items, ultimately saving you money and allowing you to plan for the upcoming months efficiently. Have a weekly rotation Establishing a weekly rotation for your shopping helps you stay organized, manage your budget, and reduce waste. By planning your weekly meals and creating a shopping list in advance, you can avoid impulse purchases and save time by knowing exactly what you need from the grocery store. This method also allows for better inventory management, as you can avoid purchasing duplicate goods or perishable items that may go bad before they can be consumed. To maximize the benefits of a weekly rotation, consider planning your meals around items that are currently on sale or in season. This way, you will be able to enjoy a variety of dishes while being cost-effective. Conclusion Becoming a savvy shopper involves taking advantage of the digital world, planning strategically, and utilizing resources effectively. With techniques like signing up for email lists, shopping online judiciously, purchasing seasonally, and establishing a weekly rotation for your shopping, you will be well on your way to maximizing savings, reducing waste, and enjoying the most of your retail experiences. With these tips in hand, unleash your inner smart shopper and start taking control of your spending habits today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose from: 1. no 2. yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What's the difference between an astronaut and a cosmonaut? The primary difference between an astronaut and a cosmonaut lies in the country of origin and the space programs they represent. The term \\"astronaut\\" is used primarily for space travelers from the United States, participating in the US space program, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), and astronauts from ESA (European Space Agency) countries, Canada, and Japan. On the other hand, \\"cosmonaut\\" is exclusively used to refer to space travelers from Russia or older Soviet Union countries, participating in the Russian space program, Roscosmos (Russian Federal Space Agency). The distinction in these terms has historical roots, and it signifies the competitive spirit that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era and the infamous Space Race. In terms of training, astronauts and cosmonauts receive similar preparation with the objective of effectively carrying out tasks in space. This includes learning spacecraft systems, maintaining physical fitness, conducting spacewalks (extravehicular activities), and experiencing extreme environments like microgravity and isolation. They also undergo specific training for the spacecraft they'll be using and collaborate with international astronauts, regardless of their titles. In summary, astronauts and cosmonauts perform similar tasks and undergo comparable training, but their key differences lie in the country of origin and the space agency they represent. Question 2: How much does an astronaut working on the ISS get paid? An astronaut's salary depends on their country of origin, their civil service rank, and professional experience. In the case of NASA astronauts working on the International Space Station (ISS), their compensation is regulated by the United States Federal Government's General Schedule (GS) pay scale. The pay scale typically ranges from GS-11 to GS-14 for a NASA astronaut. For instance, as of 2021, a GS-11 employee is paid an annual salary starting at 72,750, which increases with experience up to 94,581. Similarly, a GS-12 employee's salary begins at 87,198, extending up to 113,362. At the GS-13 level, the figures lie between 103,690 and 134,798, while a GS-14 employee earns somewhere in the range of 122,530 to 159,286. Additional locality pay adjustments can also contribute to the overall salary, based on the area where the astronaut resides or works. Astronauts employed by other agencies, like the European Space Agency (ESA), Canadian Space Agency (CSA), or Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), follow different compensation structures as per the respective country's policies. For example, a cosmonaut's salary in Russia may vary depending on their experience and rank in the Russian military forces. Regarding the questions' similarity, it is evident that Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 seeks to explore distinctions between astronauts and cosmonauts, while Question 2 aims to determine the salary of astronauts working on the ISS."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people who are thought to be rustlers by the bar patrons? , can you please find it? In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford).

Amanda begins looking for a new apartment and finds one with four struggling models, Jade (Shalom Harlow), Roxana (Ivana MiliÄeviÄ), Candi (Sarah O'Hare), and Holly (Tomiko Fraser). When Amanda discovers that Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the guy she likes, lives in the apartment across from hers she starts spying on him to try to find his flaw. One night Amanda sees Jim kill a woman, Megan O'Brien (Tanja Reichert), and by the time the police arrive they don't believe Amanda because she is the only witness, and the evidence is gone. Annoyed about the police's lack of effort to find out what has really happened, Amanda and her new friends investigate on their own. When Amanda finds out about what she thinks is Jim's involvement with Megan's death, she confronts him. Amanda's judgment turns out to be wrong and Jim's (who turns out to be undercover cop, Bob Smoot, who was trying to gain Halloran's (Jay Brazeau) trust by staging his partner Megan's death) cover is blown. Amanda discovers that Jim is investigating Halloran, a Russian man who has been smuggling in money and who Amanda has been privately restoring a painting for.

Here is a hypothesis: the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate actions Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, given the context and logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Let's break down the provided information and understand the relationship between the two statements. Premise: The premise suggests that in situations where senior management involvement seems lacking or when the project organization is unstable and subject to high turnover, the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate actions. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate actions. The hypothesis is in line with the overall direction and intention of the premise. The premise describes specific circumstances under which the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate actions, whereas the hypothesis is a broader statement of the auditor's recommendation for actions from the agency. Given that the premise essentially provides the context and conditional scenarios for the hypothesis, we can conclude that if the premise is true under the given conditions, then the hypothesis is also true. In other words, if it is true that the auditor should recommend appropriate actions by the agency in specific situations (lack of senior management involvement or unstable project organization), then it follows that the auditor should recommend actions by the agency in general, as stated in the hypothesis. However, it is essential to remember that the conclusion is based upon the premise and the assumptions made in it. If the premise were to change or prove to be false, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis might need to be reevaluated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Children of the Corn Movie plot: The film opens in 1963 in the town of Hemingford in western Nebraska, which is in the middle of a severe drought. In a tent out in the vast cornfields, a young boy, claiming that the Old Testament-era Canaanite God whom he calls \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" had spoken to him in his dreams, telling the other children that the sinful and blasphemous adults are the reason for their recent troubles (making a comparison to the corruption in Sodom and Gomorrah). The boy preacher tells the children that they must kill everybody age 19 and over in town; leading them to found a death cult with a prime rule that, once reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.Twelve years later in the year 1975, a constantly bickering couple consisting of Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure) are driving along a back road near Gatlin, Nebraska, planning on celebrating their second honeymoon in California, when a boy named Joseph (Ramington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn and in front of their car. Accidentally running Joseph over, Burt assesses his body and realizes the boy's throat was slashed. After wrapping and placing Joseph's body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around with shotgun in hand. Among the corn, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase and takes it with him back to the car. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they were being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the nine-year-old boy preacher and current cult leader, and his most loyal follower, the 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman).After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station before deciding to go to Gatlin after finding the phones non-functional.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Ears are for hearing -- everyone knows that. But for a creature called the Cuvier's beaked whale, hearing starts in the throat, a new study found. The observation might help explain how all whales hear. The work might also help scientists understand how animals are affected by underwater sonar . This sonar, used by some ships, sends out sound waves to locate underwater objects. The Cuvier's beaked whale is a so-called toothed whale. Toothed whales dive deep into the ocean in search of food. As the whales hunt, they produce sounds that reach objects and then return to the whales. This allows the animals to \\"see\\" the shape, size, and location of objects, even when they're 1,000 meters under the sea, where it is totally dark. To better understand how the whale hears, researchers from San Diego State University in California took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales. The whales had died and washed up on the beach. Ted Cranford and his colleagues used the images to make a computer model of a Cuvier's beaked whale's head. Then, they modeled the process of sound traveling through the head. The researchers knew that some sounds get to the ears of a toothed whale through a structure called \\"the window for sound\\". Found on the lower jaw, this structure is very thin on the outside and has a large pad of fat on the inside. When the researchers used their computer model to work out how sound waves travel in the whale's head, they were surprised to find that sounds coming from right in front of the whale actually travel under the animal's jaw. From there, sound waves move through the throat, into a hole in the back of the jaw, and finally to the pad of fat near the animal's ears. Cranford guesses that other types of whales may hear through their throats. Further testing is needed to be sure. Eventually, the insight into how whales hear might explain whether sonar testing by military ships is causing the animals to wind up on beaches. Question: Which of the following describes the way taken by sound waves through a Cuvier's beaked whale? Options: A: A hole in the back of the jaw - the ears - the jaw - the throat. B: The jaw - the throat - a hole in the back of the jaw - the ears. C: The throat - the jaw - the ears - a hole in the back of the jaw.

(May 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In the small town of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) causes widespread panic and mayhem when he rings the alarm bell, claiming the sky is falling. He is humiliated in front of his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) and the entire town when, after telling everyone a piece of the sky 'shaped like a stop sign' had hit him on the head, he is unable to find it. All the residents assume an acorn must have fallen on him, and Chicken Little becomes a laughing stock. One year later, Little is still being ridiculed for the incident and is bullied at school by Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) and her band of cronies. His friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina) advise him to talk about his feelings with his father, but Little is more concerned with restoring his reputation outright. Following a bust-up with Foxy, his father is called in, and Little overhears the school principal stating that Buck had been the school baseball star in his youth. Determined to rekindle his relationship with his father, Chicken Little signs onto the baseball team. In the final inning of the big Oakey Oaks pennant game, with all the other players injured, he is called up to bat, and manages to hit an inside-the-park home run. Despite some confusion, the umpire ultimately declares the game won; Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant. Later that evening, Chicken Little prepares to go to a victory party being thrown for him by Abby, Runt and Fish, but another 'piece of the sky' identical to the one he had been hit by the previous year falls through his bedroom window.

Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In some organisms, how are these molecules absorbed?","completion":"In some organisms, these small water-soluble food molecules are absorbed through a process called diffusion or active transport in the small intestine. Step-by-step: 1. After mechanical and chemical digestion has taken place, the food particles become small, water-soluble molecules. 2. These molecules reach the small intestine, which is lined with tiny, finger-like projections called villi. 3. Villi increase the surface area available for absorption, allowing more molecules to be absorbed simultaneously. 4. Microvilli, even smaller finger-like projections on the villi, further increase the surface area and efficiency of absorption. 5. The small molecules, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, pass through the cells of the villi by diffusion or active transport. 6. Diffusion: Molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, passively absorbing into the bloodstream. 7. Active transport: Molecules are transported across the cell membrane using energy (ATP) and specific transport proteins. 8. Once absorbed, these nutrient-rich molecules are transported via capillaries to the bloodstream, where they can be distributed and utilized throughout the organism's body. By following these steps, absorption of small water-soluble food molecules is achieved in some organisms, primarily through the small intestine."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","completion":"\\"Open sores\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense to the question \\"If a person picks at their skin what will they have?\\" because picking at the skin can damage the protective barrier and potentially expose the underlying layers. The step-by-step reasoning is as follows: 1. Understand the question: The question asks about the possible outcome of a person picking at their skin. 2. Assess possible answers: Analyzing the given options - bloody marks, open sores, different, schizophrenia, anxiety. 3. Connect the action with the result: Picking at the skin is a physical action that can cause damage to the skin. 4. Eliminate unrelated options: Schizophrenia and anxiety are mental health issues that might be associated with skin picking behavior, but they are not direct physical consequences of the action. Similarly, 'different' does not provide any specific information related to skin picking. 5. Compare the remaining options: Bloody marks and open sores are both results of damaging the skin. However, bloody marks describe an immediate consequence, while open sores describe a more prolonged or severe consequence. 6. Choose the most appropriate answer: Open sores align more closely with human common sense because it assumes the person continues picking at their skin, causing a more long-lasting, visible, and concerning outcome.

In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year. What causes the disease and why is it dangerous? Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters in your mouth. A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth. Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger. A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults. In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet.

The team relocated from New Orleans to Salt Lake City, Utah for the 1979-80 season. 3. As of April 15, 2015, they are the last franchise to not record a 60-loss season. Although the Utah Jazz's commendable record of avoiding a 60-loss season demonstrates a level of consistency in their performance, it does not provide sufficient data to confirm that they have the most wins of any NBA team. To make such a conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the total number of wins by all NBA teams across their respective histories would be necessary. Moreover, it is essential to compare the Utah Jazz's win-loss ratio, championships, and overall performance to other historically successful NBA teams such as the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers, and Chicago Bulls. These factors should be considered over the entire duration of the teams' existence to ensure an accurate comparison. In conclusion, although the Utah Jazz has demonstrated commendable consistency in avoiding a 60-loss season up until April 15, 2015, this information alone cannot establish the team as having the most wins of any NBA team.

Five years ago, University of Arizona undergrad Luju Ojha worked on a project to digitally remove weather distortion from satellite pictures of Mars. In the process, he discovered streaks on hillsides called “recurring slope lineae” were changing. The images strongly suggested liquid water was flowing along the surface of Mars, not in some distant past epoch, but right now. This was the scientific equivalent of rummaging around in the sofa for loose change and finding the Lost Treasure of the Aztec Empire. Since then, NASA has worked feverishly to find out as much as they can. Now they think they know what’s going on. Mars has an atmosphere. Not much of one, but it’s there. And that air has a small amount of humidity. Martian soil is riddled with perchlorates, which pull water out of the air and hang on to it. Ever dealt with clumped-up salt on a humid day? It’s the same principle. So the air gets a little drier, and the soil gets a little wetter. Thing is, when you mix perchlorates and water, you get briny water. And just like adding anti-freeze to a radiator, perchlorates drive the freezing point of water down. In fact, the freezing point drops so low that the water can remain liquid in the frigid temperatures of Mars. Water’s heavy, so it seeps into the ground. Over time, it builds up as a small aquifer. Eventually pressure or geological activity causes it to erupt and flow along the surface. This leaves the streaks behind that our hero Luju Ojha discovered. Then what happens to the water? Believe it or not, despite being well below zero degrees Celsius, it actually boils. When you lower air pressure, you lower the boiling point of water. Once the brine is exposed to Mars’s extremely thin atmosphere (about 1/200th the pressure of Earth at sea level), it boils away, leaving only a salty residue and streaked soil behind. Now the water is back in the atmosphere, and the cycle begins anew. On Sept. 28, NASA announced the strongest evidence yet for liquid water on Mars. This new research increases the possibility for astronauts to rely on the red planet's own water in future space travel. (NASA) This is a huge discovery. Most scientists consider liquid water to be a requirement for life. Not all agree, but one thing’s for certain: All life on Earth requires it. Furthermore, everywhere on Earth where there’s liquid water, there’s life. No exceptions. If there’s life on Mars, it’ll be in that briny water, and evidence of it will be in those streaks. Mars is slightly more likely to have native life than any other alien planet, because it’s physically close to Earth. The two planets frequently exchange material due to astronomical events (which is a fancy way of saying “rocks hitting each other really hard”). Every now and then, Earth or Mars has a massive asteroid impact, one so massive it kicks material completely out of the victim planet’s gravity well and into solar orbit. The rocks and debris wander around the solar system for a while, and some of it falls onto the other planet. We have plenty of meteorites on Earth that were originally from Mars. It’s reasonable to assume Mars can say the same about Earth. It’s possible (unlikely, but possible) that Earth life hitched a ride on one of those transfers. A particularly hearty bacteria or maybe just a few strands of robust RNA. And maybe, just maybe, it survived re-entry and “infected” Mars. These are some pretty low odds. But however unlikely that scenario is, it’s more likely than life evolving on its own. So if any planet in our solar system is going to have life (other than Earth), it’s probably Mars. And now we know Mars has liquid water, a requirement for Earth life and for anything that evolved from Earth life. There may be microscopic organisms on Mars that have lived there for millions, maybe billions of years. They could be descendants of Earth’s first little one-celled astronauts that made the harrowing journey to the Red Planet. An alien invasion that happened a long time ago in a galaxy… well… in this galaxy right here. So what do we do about it? Well, that’s where the arguing begins. We’re going to have two camps of scientists at each others’ throats on the issue. There’s a briny water patch just 50km from the Curiosity lander. That’s within range; she could go there and take a look. So why not do it? Planetary protection proponents believe we run a significant risk of infecting Mars with modern Earth life. And they believe that’s something we have to be very mindful of. An invasive biological contaminant could displace naturally-evolved life and ruin Mars’s ecosphere (if it has one). To guard against that, NASA does their best to sterilize landers so no Earth life can stow away and cause problems. They did this with Curiosity, but not sufficiently to the liking of planetary protection people. They say Curiosity is too much of a danger, and it could have Earth bacteria aboard. They’re actively blocking any attempt to send Curiosity to the briny patch. And here we reach the “highly opinionated” portion of this article, where I offer my take: Are you people out of your minds? We have a chance to find out if there’s life on Mars with a probe we already have on the planet, and you’re blocking it for fear that Earth life will kill it? Earth and Mars have been exchanging material for literally billions of years. If Earth life is going to infect Mars, it’s happened repeatedly. Besides, NASA and the Soviet (and later, Russian) space agency have landed over a dozen probes on the surface, some of them fairly clean, others not so clean. So again, if Earth life is going to infect Mars, it probably already has. At this point, you might be tempted to say, “We may have displaced native life in the landed areas, but not in other areas.” Well, either Earth life is a death sentence to Mars, or it isn’t. If it is, the damage was done long ago. If it isn’t, then it’s safe to inspect the nearby briny patch — the worst we can do is ruin that patch. We can’t be timid in our exploration of Mars. If you think probes have a lot of bacteria, just wait until we send humans. Or will you block manned missions, too? Should it be our fate to hide on Earth until the end of time, terrified of disturbing extraterrestrial life that might not even exist? The probe is named “Curiosity” for a reason. Send her to the briny patch. Let’s see what she finds out. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In this article, the author discusses the discovery of liquid water on Mars and the possibility of life on the planet.

Background: Esma Redzepova-Teodosievska (Macedonian: Esma Redzhepova-Teodosievska Macedonian pronunciation: ['esma re'dZepova teo'dosiefska]; 8 August 1943 - 11 December 2016) was a Macedonian vocalist, songwriter, and humanitarian of Romani ethnicity. Because of her prolific repertoire, which includes hundreds of songs, and because of her contribution to Roma culture and its promotion, she was nicknamed Queen of the Gypsies. Context: During the 1980s, the musical career of Esma Redzepova slowed down. In 1989, she settled back in Skopje with her husband. After independence in 1991, the Republic of Macedonia went through difficult times. Stevo Teodosievski died in 1997 at 72. However, Esma Redzepova toured the United States the year after, performing at a series of benefit concerts. She also released a selection of duets with Usnija Jasarova in 1994. The 2000s where very fruitful and marked a slight shift in the singer's career. In Macedonia and former Yugoslavia, Esma gained a more modern image and redefined herself as a worldbeat artist. For instance, she made several collaborations with young pop singers. In 2002, she recorded a song with the Croatian band Magazin and a duet with the Macedonian singer Todor Proeski. She also recorded a song with the Bosnian band Crno Vino in 2005 and made a collaboration with Kiril Dzajkovski in 2010. On the international scene, Esma Redzepova contributed towards the establishment of Roma music as a non-mass-market good, pleasing an urban and cultural elite. However, many of her new songs were not widely accepted by Western audience because they did not match its expectation about Roma music. For instance, some songs featured synthesizer, an instrument that is not used in traditional Roma music. Esma was even booed at a concert in Spain, but defended herself saying that Roma music has always adapted itself and borrowed external features. Her best known single, Caje Sukarije, is the feature song on the 2006 Borat movie soundtrack, which she claims was used without her permission. Together with Naat Veliov from Kocani Orkestar she sued the producers of the film for 800,000 euro (USD 1,000,000). Afterwards, Redzepova won a EUR26,000 compensation, since it turned out that Cohen got permission from her production house to take the song, which she was not notified about. Esma was particularly upset because her song was used to illustrate backwardness, something she always fought. However, Borat contributed towards the expansion of her fame internationally. Esma Redzepova was selected together with Vlatko Lozanoski to represent Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. Their song, \\"Imperija\\", was unveiled in March 2013, but it caused controversy in the country as its clip featured many monuments of the controversial project Skopje 2014. The song was thus viewed as a nationalist act. Macedonian Radio-Television requested the singers write a new song. Eventually, \\"Pred da se razdeni\\" was released a month later. The song failed to advance from the second semi-final of the competition on 16 May 2013, placing 16th in the field of 17 songs, scoring 28 points. Question: What else did she do in her career?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Esma Redzepova was a talented singer, songwriter, and humanitarian.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dyslexic Law Graduate Sues on Exam's Time Limit In the newest legal battleground over what assistance must be given to learning-disabled students, a dyslexic 1996 law school graduate has sued the California committee of bar examiners, saying that its refusal to allow him to double the normal time to take the bar examination violated Federal anti-discrimination laws. The class-action lawsuit, filed by Robert Mueller on behalf of all learning-disabled law graduates, said the state had illegally thwarted his career by failing to accommodate his disability, which makes him a slow reader. Precisely what accommodations the Federal law requires for those with learning disabilities has been an increasingly contentious -- and litigious -- issue among educators and testers since 1992, when the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act went into effect. As the first wave of students determined to have learning disabilities moves through graduate education, those students are charting a new frontier, demanding that accommodations like extra time, a quiet room or use of a computer when they take professional licensing exams in law, medicine or accounting. *In June, in a West Virginia case against the National Board of Medical Examiners, a Federal district judge ruled against three medical students with attention-deficit disorder who had sought extra time and a separate testing room on their medical exams. *In July, in a New York case now on appeal, a Federal district judge ruled that the state bar examiners had wrongly refused accommodations to Marilyn Bartlett, a 1991 University of Vermont law graduate who lost her law-firm job in 1992 after failing the bar examination three times, and sued the state in 1993. The judge ordered, among other things, that Ms. Bartlett get double time, use of a word processor and the right to circle multiple-choice answers on the question sheet, rather than fill out a separate answer sheet. *In August, in a closely watched case involving Boston University, a Federal judge ruled that although the university had the right to set academic standards, its crackdown on accommodations to learning-disabled students had been based on uninformed stereotypes. The judge overturned the university's policy of accepting diagnoses only from certain professionals and ordered the university to reconsider whether its foreign-language requirement was essential to its view of liberal arts education. The California bar examiners granted accommodations to 305 applicants taking the July examination this year, down from 335 last year -- but up from 91 in 1990. While some of the accommodations are for students with physical disabilities, the majority are for those with learning disabilities or attention deficit disorder. Lawrence Ashe Jr., the lawyer representing the state bar in the lawsuit filed last month in Federal District Court in Oakland, said he believed the bar's handling of Mr. Mueller's request was proper -- and he suggested that reading at a normal rate might well be a legitimate qualification for becoming a lawyer. Increasingly, Mr. Ashe said, the bar examiners are turning to outside professionals for help in evaluating accommodation requests and are developing new procedures for handling requests. Erica Moeser, president of the National Conference of Bar Examiners, said: ''Matching disabilities to the appropriate accommodations is not an easy task, but I'd say most examiners do their best to truly level the playing field for people with disabilities. It has been a thicket, but my sense is that most disabilities are accommodated, although perhaps not to the level requested. Nationally, California has developed reputation for being among the more generously accommodating of jurisdictions.'' Sid Wolinsky, the lawyer representing Mr. Mueller, said that California's reputation was well-deserved -- until late last year. ''Up until the period leading to the February exam, we never received a single complaint about the bar's failure to give accommodations,'' said Mr. Wolinsky, a lawyer with Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland, who also represented the students in the Boston University case. ''But at the end of 1996, we had a rash of complaints, all of them from learning-disabled students who'd had accommodations in law school, but were being denied for the February bar. Then we had another set of complaints from people denied for the July exam. I've gotten the distinct impression that they're singling out learning disabilities, and cracking down.'' Mr. Mueller's case, he said, is typical of the recent denials. Now 44, he was found to have dyslexia in 1994. According to his psychologist's 1994 evaluation, Mr. Mueller's reading rate is in the bottom 3 percent of college seniors and his timed reading comprehension is in the bottom 5 percent. Untimed, however, his reading scores are in the high average to superior range. After years as a photographer, Mr. Mueller became interested in law and his diagnosis allowed him double time on the Law School Admission Test. As a student at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, he got double time on all his examinations. In 1995, he took the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination with double time -- a requirement for admission to the state bar -- and passed. But the California bar examiners, based on their expert's review of documents he submitted, said Mr. Mueller could only have time and a half for the examination. Mr. Mueller took the exam under those conditions in February, and failed. He took it again in July, but later asked that the exam not be graded. Mr. Ashe was critical of that request, saying, ''I don't think that requesting that your exam not be scored is consistent with someone who wants to be admitted as soon as possible and is mitigating his losses.'' Graph: ''BY THE NUMBERS: Special Needs'' tracks number of stucents with disabilities who got accommodations like extra time on the California bar exam each July. Graph runs from 1990 through 1997. (Source: California Committee of Bar Examiners) Summary:","completion":"A dyslexic law school graduate, Robert Mueller, sued the California committee of bar examiners because they didn't give him double the time to take the bar exam. He said this broke the law that tries to help people with disabilities. This law has been causing arguments about what help should be given to students with learning disabilities. More and more students with disabilities are asking for help when they take exams for important jobs like being a lawyer, doctor, or accountant. Some people think that being able to read fast is important for being a lawyer, and everyone should be treated fairly when taking the exams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"?, using the article: Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century. As a..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was 'crying as though her heart would break'?\\" is Bedřich Smetana. He was a Czech composer who faced hardships in his personal life, including a stressful marriage and illness. The article you provided discusses his contributions to Czech opera and the development of a style of music that equated with the emerging Czech national spirit. On the day he was transferred to the asylum, his daughter Žofie was mentioned to be crying inconsolably."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

From 2004 to 2006, it was part of a coalition with the Democrats and two other parties, and after 2006 it was the dominant party in two other coalitions. The party initiated two changes of government from 2004 prior to losing power in the 2012 election. The Democrats were the dominant force in a ruling coalition between 1996 and 2000, and an almost-equal partner with the Peoples Revolutionary Party in a coalition between 2004 and 2006.

Amtrak, for example, lets you pack a bike in a box for 10, carry folding bikes on as luggage, and even offers several trains with walk-on bike cars. Every company is different, however, so don't just buy a ticket and expect your bike to get on easily. You need to do your homework ahead of time to make sure you can transport your bike effectively. Expect a handling fee for bicycles, especially if they are not boxed up. This involves removing all the pieces, stripping off the handlebars, wheels, and pedals so that the bike fits in a large box. While you can usually get old boxes for free or cheaply by inquiring at your local bike shop, entrepreneurial packers can potentially fit the bike very large TV or appliance boxes. If you are uncomfortable with bike mechanics, you may want to get your local shop to break down the bike for you. You can then take the bike to a local shop at your new location to get it back together, for a small fee. This may be important for ensuring you're not carrying too much on board. Check the train service's website for any weight restrictions. Amtrak, for example, has a 50lb limit. This, however, should be more than enough for your bike. If you cannot weigh the bags at home, most Post Offices have a large scale you can use before you leave. Talk to the staff at the station about where you need to be, protocol, and tagging your bike so you can get it later. For longer trips, or anything requiring that you dismantle your bike and pack it in a box, arrive an hour before departure. Many bike shops will break down, package, and ship your bike across the country for you at a nominal fee, usually 20-30 plus shipping. Shipping, however, can get expensive. If you want to do it yourself, you should remove the wheels, handlebars, seats, and pedals and pack them into a bike box or large TV box, then ship the package from a post office, UPS, or FedEx.

Therefore, we can eliminate this option. b) City Hall: City Hall is generally the administrative hub for public entities and typically not a venue for private company meetings. Hence, we can eliminate this option. c) Zoo: A zoo is primarily an attraction for visitors to observe wildlife. It is not an appropriate or professional location for a company's committee meeting. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. Step 3: Compare the remaining options We are left with two options now - office building and boardroom. a) Office Building: An office building might house multiple companies and potentially offer shared meeting spaces.

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices, made freely in this present life, in the afterlife. The importance placed on thought, action, responsibility, and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by, and inspired a number of, Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.

Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... contains an answer for the question: What has there been a drastic decline in over the past 100 years that is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water?, what is it ?

Article: He’ll have hundreds of millions of dollars, the bully pulpit, Air Force One and high-profile supporters from Warren Buffett to Lady Gaga behind him. But President Obama’s chances of re-election could come down to a single strategic question: To what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012? On Politics The Times’s political editor on 2012. Or to break the question into its most important component parts: Can Mr. Obama overcome the bad economy, and perhaps even turn it to his advantage in certain ways, in the same way President George W. Bush overcame and in a sense turned to his advantage the bloody, expensive and increasingly unpopular war in Iraq eight years ago? And can Mr. Obama do to his opponent – for now let’s say Mitt Romney – what Mr. Bush did to Senator John Kerry in 2004? The parallels are sufficient enough that Mr. Obama and his team have studied, and to a striking degree are replicating, the Bush re-election playbook. Already they are building a narrative in which Mr. Obama made politically brave decisions to do what was right for the economy, even if those decisions were unpopular. It’s a theme that echoes Mr. Bush’s argument in 2004 that he did what it took to keep the country safe, and that even if you disagreed with him, you knew where he stood. As for defining the opponent, Mr. Obama’s supporters are already hard at work hammering home the idea that Mr. Romney is an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who says and does whatever is necessary to advance his political interests. It’s an approach that bears a passing similarity to the Bush re-election campaign’s efforts to paint Mr. Kerry as an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who. … You get the idea. The similarities –- and differences — between the two re-election efforts are a regular topic of conversation and debate among strategists in both parties. “Politics is infused with rich ironies,” said Mark McKinnon, who was Mr. Bush’s media strategist in 2000 and 2004, noting that Mr. Obama had reached the White House in large part by running against Mr. Bush’s record and policies. At the heart of both approaches is an insight frequently invoked by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush’s strategist, in 2004: an election is a choice, not a referendum. By that, he meant that an incumbent’s job is not to prove he is perfect – it is to prove that he’s better than the other guy. Mr. Obama’s aides now see their job in much the same way. “If someone is going to beat us, they’re going to be thoroughly known when they win,” said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s longtime strategist. “They’re not just going to win by default. It’s way too glib to say that not being Obama is going to be sufficient.” But it is way too early to know if the strategy will work for Mr. Obama as it did, albeit barely, for Mr. Bush. Matthew Dowd, who was a Bush strategist in 2004 but voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, said Mr. Bush had somewhat better job-approval numbers during his re-election campaign than Mr. Obama does now. As a result, he said, Mr. Obama is at greater risk of facing voters who have already made up their minds to vote against him almost no matter who the alternative is. “If he doesn’t get some lift in his approval numbers, it will be hard to make this a choice election,” said Mr. Dowd, who met with Mr. Obama late last year as the White House sought to regain its footing following the big Democratic losses in the midterm election. The Obama team, he said, “wants to make Mitt Romney into the Republican version of John Kerry.” Mr. Obama stacks up relatively well against Mr. Romney and other Republicans in polls of head-to-head matchups in battleground states. But where Mr. Bush successfully cultivated an image as a decisive leader in a way that sharpened the comparison to Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dowd said, Mr. Obama could have trouble drawing as sharp a contrast. “The value that the American public is looking for is a strong and decisive leader at a time of anxiety and challenge,” Mr. Dowd said. “In order to make the contrast, you have to have that value yourself, and Obama doesn’t have it.” Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director in the Bush White House and a senior aide to Senator John McCain’s 2008 campaign, said Mr. Obama’s chances of replicating the Bush strategy also would be hurt by opposition to specific policies, like the health care bill and the economic stimulus spending. “Obama at his core seems sensitive to the idea that this is going to be a referendum on him,” she said. “You see it in some of their thin-skinned responses to criticism. To me they’re revealing some of their feelings of vulnerability on that question.” Mr. McKinnon, who left Mr. McCain’s campaign in 2008 because he admired Mr. Obama and did not want to work against him, said that once Mr. Bush and his team settled on a message in 2004 built around national security, they stuck with it, day in, day out. Mr. Obama, he suggested, has yet to find the re-election story line he can use to project his strengths and draw contrasts to Mr. Romney or whoever wins the Republican nomination. “We decided even if our strategy was flawed, it was better to have one we stuck with rather than a strategy a month,” he said of the Bush 2004 campaign. “Team Obama clearly gets that they need to compare and contrast and they need discipline. The question is, will they have a compelling message and narrative?” ||||| A beleaguered president seeks re-election. His challenger, a candidate with Massachusetts roots and a presidential demeanor straight out of central casting, has to fight through a primary contest fending off charges of flip-flopping. In the end, the challenger's strength also proves his vulnerability. FILE - In this Oct. 4, 2011, file photo, President Barack Obama speaks at a fundraiser in St. Louis. Democrats in and around Obama’s campaign are targeting Republican Mitt Romney by drawing on lessons... (Associated Press) Election 2012 is looking a lot like the presidential race of 2004. Democrats in and around President Barack Obama's campaign are preparing to run against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney _ the man they believe likely to emerge from the Republican contest _ by borrowing from the playbook George W. Bush and Republicans used to defeat Sen. John Kerry seven years ago. As candidates, Kerry and Romney are remarkably similar. Both are wealthy men, products of Massachusetts politics, eloquent on the stump but perceived as remote or aloof on the campaign circuit. Even before Romney has won a single nominating contest, Obama's camp is singling him out as a fickle politician and is preparing to go straight at Romney's perceived strength _ his record as a businessman in the face of a flat-line economy. It was a strategy Republicans employed against Kerry, who faced flip-flopping claims himself and whose strength as a decorated Vietnam veteran running in the first post-Sept. 11 election was undermined by attack ads. A key feature of the Obama strategy is Romney's tenure as head of Bain Capital, a private equity firm he co-founded in 1984 that saved and launched businesses such as Staples and Domino's Pizza but sliced jobs elsewhere through cost-cutting and consolidation. It's not the first time Romney's tenure at the helm of Bain Capital has come under attack. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pulled away from Romney during his 1994 Senate race in Massachusetts by airing a series of ads that featured workers from an Indiana paper plant that Bain took over, laying off employees, cutting wages and reducing benefits. \\"Basically, he cut our throats,\\" a worker said in one of the ads. \\"When we made the decision to define him to voters of Massachusetts and took a hard line in doing so, we had a lot of success,\\" said Democratic consultant Tad Devine, who crafted the ads for Kennedy and later served as a senior adviser to Kerry's presidential campaign. Obama advisers are keenly aware of Kennedy's line of attack and are counting on similar results. \\"In his professional life, he was an expert in stripping down companies and leading them to bankruptcy and profiting from these ventures, with a lot of jobs lost in the process,\\" said Obama strategist David Axelrod, previewing a potential line of attack. \\"Whenever you're running for president of the United States and you represent yourself in a certain way and you say here's my core asset, then you need to be able to stand by your record,\\" Axelrod added in an interview. \\"It was problematic for him then; it will be problematic for him now.\\" Republicans concede that Romney could be vulnerable. But they say the Romney camp should be ready for the onslaught. Michael Dennehy, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist, said he remembers Kennedy's anti-Romney ads as being \\"just brutal and very, very effective.\\" \\"To some extent it will be effective again,\\" he said. \\"The variable is how Romney responds and what they have learned from that 1994 race for Senate.\\" Dennehy, who helped run Sen. John McCain's presidential races in 2000 and 2008, added: \\"I think we can expect from Obama's campaign a very scorched-earth approach. It's the only way he can win.\\" Top Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom said Obama, faced with a stagnant economy, is grasping for ways to win. \\"Now, they are employing a \`kill Mitt' strategy,\\" he said. \\"I suspect they'll go through many other strategies before they realize this election is a referendum on Obama's failed leadership on jobs.\\" For now, the Obama camp is focusing on portraying Romney as a finger-to-the-wind politician who changes his convictions to meet the political circumstances. They cite his embrace of mandatory health insurance when he was governor of Massachusetts and his criticism of Obama's health care bill, which relies on the same mandate, or his previous stance in favor of abortion rights against his current opposition to abortion. \\"I will give him this, he is as vehement and as strong in his convictions when he takes one position as he is when he takes a diametrically opposite view,\\" Axelrod said last week. On Wednesday, Axelrod pounced again, declaring on CBS that Romney appeared to have \\"no core to him.\\" No doubt Romney stands as the Republican to beat for his party's nomination. He has maintained a steady position as other Republicans rise and fall around him. Democrats in Obama's circle believe that barring an unexpected development, Romney will be the nominee. As a result, their sideline denunciations are designed to begin a story line they intend to build upon in the general election. Gerry Chervinsky, a Massachusetts pollster who conducted public surveys during the Kennedy-Romney contest and during Kerry's presidential bid, said attacks on Romney's shifting stances aren't likely to damage him because he confronted them in 2007 and 2008 when he first ran for president. \\"The Romney business issue, however, I think would score points,\\" he said. \\"Teddy (Kennedy) had excellent info and made terrific TV spots and definitely left the impression that Romney's business record was based on laying people off to make big bucks.\\" Once the ads ran, Romney was unable to recover and lost to Kennedy. But the damage was not permanent. Romney ran for governor in 2002 and won. So far, with the exception of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Republicans running against Romney have not tried to turn Romney's business experience against him. During a debate last week, Huntsman described Romney as \\"somebody who breaks down businesses, destroys jobs as opposed to creating jobs and opportunity, leveraging up, spinning off, enriching shareholders.\\" \\"The whole discussion around this campaign is going to be job creation _ how can you win that debate given your background?\\" Huntsman asked him. Romney parried the question, noting that Bain Capital had launched Staples and Sports Authority. \\"We didn't take things apart and cut them off and sell them off,\\" Romney said. \\"We instead helped start businesses.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"President Obama's chances of re-election in 2012 could come down to a single strategic question: To what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012?

His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet.

Pánfilo de Narváez had been sent by Governor Velázquez from Cuba to kill or capture Cortés, who had defied Velazquez's orders. :281 Leaving his \\"least reliable soldiers\\" under the command of the headstrong Pedro de Alvarado to guard Moctezuma, Cortés set out against De Narváez, who had advanced onto Cempoala.

But one RBS advisor launched her own bank delivery service when she travelled to a war veteran's home during her lunchbreak to help him following a break-in. Louis Butler, 92, said Victoria Mowbray had restored his 'faith in human nature' by going the extra mile after burglars stole hundreds of pounds in cash from his home. Louis Butler said his 'faith in human nature' was restored by bank worker Victoria Mowbray who went to his aid when he rang to cancel his cards after his home was burgled. When Mr Butler rang RBS customer services to cancel his stolen bank cards Ms Mowbray was so touched by his tale she drove the two miles to his home and rang bank colleagues and even the police on his behalf. Mr Butler, who was honoured personally by King George VI for flying Lancaster Bombers during the war, said: 'The lady at the bank was great and she has restored my faith in human nature. 'She cancelled my missing bank cards and phoned the police for me so I could report the crime. She even called my daughter Angela to tell her what happened. She helped me with everything. 'It just shows the bank can help customers where it matters. I was dreading getting through to a call centre in India but to get through to someone working up the road was like a breath of fresh air. 'For her to then come over and help me was above and beyond the call of duty. I just wish more banks could operate like this when their customers need them.' Widower Mr Butler was asleep when. burglars broke into his home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. and grabbed £300 in cash, his laptop, his passport and other important. identification and information. He woke up to find his desk drawer tipped out and flung to the floor and his back door left wide open. His. Distinguished Flying Medal, received from King George VI in 1943 for. his service as a wireless operator who took part in bombing raids over. Germany, was only saved as he had given it to his daughter for safe. keeping. Mr Butler said: 'I was shaken when I woke up and saw everything had been taken. 'My desk was open and the drawers were all out and so was the draw in the table in the hall. Louis Butler, pictured with a Lancaster Bomber at the London Guild Hall last year, was honoured personally by King George VI for his service during World War Two. Louis Butler, left, and his late wife Ann, both pictured during the war. The widower was alone in his house when the burglars broke in. 'They took my laptop, my folder with all my phone numbers and important letters and bills, my passport - everything that they could get their hands on. They also took £300 out of a cash jar that I have in the desk. 'I didn't know what to do until I found the phone number for the Royal Bank of Scotland customer services, so I rang them. A nice lady answered and I was very surprised but happy that she was from my local the branch rather than from a call centre in India. 'I'm hard of hearing and knew I wouldn't understand them if I got through to someone there. 'When I told her what had happened the lady just dropped everything and came straight round to my home in her car to help me cancel my cards. I was amazed. She is so helpful. I can't thank her enough.' Mr Butler's daughter Angela Hobson, 55, said: 'Dad was disorientated when he came downstairs to find all his stuff missing and what Victoria did shows there are some very kind people left in this world who go over and beyond what can be expected. Victoria Mowbray, who works at The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) branch in Shaw, pictured, has been praised for going the extra mile to help Mr Butler. 'Dad is well known and very well liked and people in the locality were disgusted and outraged when they found out what happened. 'It must have been obvious to whoever broke in that an old person lived there. He had his war pictures of Lancaster Bombers on the walls and a stairlift but it still didn't stop them.' Ms Mowbray, who works in the Shaw branch in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'I don't think I have done anything special. 'When he rang the bank, I didn't even know if he was a customer of ours or not. He was saying he was a 92-year-old man and he had been robbed. 'He said he had gone downstairs and they had taken everything. I was worried there was no-one at home with him and I couldn't have that on my mind, especially if he was in shock. 'I told my manager I needed to go even if it was my lunch. I helped him cancel all his cards and I called the police on the way to the house. 'When I got to his house I recognised him, and realised he had been a customer of the bank for a long time. I was just only too pleased to help - there are some despicable people out there.'

Perform progressive muscle relaxation Expose your body to cold water, weather, or beverages. Undergo surgery to implant a device that stimulates your vagus nerve electrically.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Boost Your Vagus Nerve Function: A Holistic Guide to Enhance Your Well-being Introduction The vagus nerve is a critical part of the human nervous system that connects the brain with several major organs, playing a vital role in controlling heart rate, digestion, and other essential functions. Studies have shown that stimulating the vagus nerve can help improve physical and mental well-being. In this article, we'll discuss various ways to stimulate the vagus nerve, such as breathing exercises, yoga, moderate to intense exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, and exposure to cold conditions. We'll also discuss a more invasive method: undergoing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through implantable devices. Step 1: Perform slow, deep breathing exercises One effective way to stimulate the vagus nerve is through slow, deep breathing exercises. Breathing is an involuntary, but also a controllable, process. By consciously controlling your breath, you can activate the vagus nerve, which can lead to reduced stress and increased relaxation. Begin by inhaling deeply through your nose for five seconds, and then exhale through your mouth for another five seconds. Repeat this process for a few minutes daily to improve vagal tone and promote overall relaxation. Step 2: Practice yoga for 90 minutes every week Yoga is known for its numerous physical, mental, and emotional benefits, including stimulating the vagus nerve. Yoga combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, which can improve vagal tone while also benefiting your overall health. Aim to practice yoga for at least 90 minutes per week, either in a class setting or through home practice. As you become more experienced, you can incorporate specific poses that are known for their positive effects on the vagus nerve, such as the fish pose and camel pose. Step 3: Engage in moderate to intense exercise 4 times a week Regular exercise is another effective way to enhance vagal function. The increased heart rate and elevated blood circulation that come with moderate to intense workouts can stimulate the vagus nerve. Aim for at least 4 sessions of exercise per week, whether it be running, swimming, cycling, or any other activity that raises your heart rate. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise routine. Step 4: Perform progressive muscle relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a technique used to induce deep relaxation by tensing and releasing various muscle groups. This process can help stimulate the vagus nerve while reducing muscle tension and stress. To perform PMR, find a quiet space to lie or sit down comfortably. Begin by tensing a specific muscle group, such as your toes, for 5-10 seconds, and then release the tension for 15-20 seconds. Gradually work your way up, focusing on different muscle groups throughout your body, until you reach your facial muscles. Step 5: Expose your body to cold water, weather, or beverages Exposure to cold conditions has been shown to activate the vagus nerve. Short, cold showers, cold weather, or consuming cold beverages can promote vagal activation, which may lead to increased resilience against stress. Begin with short bursts of cold exposure and gradually increase the duration. Always listen to your body and avoid overexposure to extreme cold for prolonged periods. Step 6: Consider undergoing vagus nerve stimulation surgery (Optional) For individuals with certain health conditions or those seeking a more invasive approach, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) surgery might be an option. VNS involves implanting a small device that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve. While it's primarily used to treat epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression, some studies suggest that it might also improve overall well-being. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if VNS is the right choice for you. Conclusion Strengthening the function of the vagus nerve is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. Through slow, deep breathing exercises, yoga, moderate to intense exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, cold exposure, and potentially VNS surgery, you can enhance your vagal tone and promote a more resilient mind and body. Start incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, and take a step towards a healthier, happier life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

PUBLISHED:. 03:44 EST, 15 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:32 EST, 18 June 2013. The British people are weary of becoming involved in another lengthy conflict overseas. after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the. Defence Secretary said today. In what. will be considered a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor over any. possible military deployment to Syria, Phillip Hammond said Afghanistan. had become Britain’s Vietnam. The Defence Secretary's remarks came. while on a visit to the main British base at Camp Bastion in the Helmand. province of Afghanistan. Vietnam effect: Phillip Hammond has warned Afghanistan has become for the British what Vietnam was for America. His remarks also come amid heightened tensions over the. Middle East between the West and Russia, as the US prepares to arm rebel fighters after it. confirmed the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on its own people. Mr Cameron has resisted greater. involvement in the Syrian conflict for the last two years partly over. fears of comparison with ex-PM Tony Blair, who took Britain into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq two years later. The Prime Minister will use the G8. Summit in Northern Ireland to talk to US President Barrack. Obama about how best to arm rebels in the country who have been trying. to topple the regime of Bashar al Assad for the past two years. Cuts row: Phillip Hammond has warned further cuts to the Ministry of Defence's budget will hurt Britain's operation effectiveness. He has already held preliminary. discussions by video conference with Mr Obama, the French President. Francois Hollande , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime. Minister Enrico Letta, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed this. morning. ‘Three days before a working dinner on. foreign policy, they discussed the situation in Syria and how G8. countries should all agree to work on together a political transition to. end the conflict,’ Downing Street said. Britain has been engaged in almost continuous conflict in the Middle Eat since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001. Since then, 444 British Service personnel have died in the Afghanistan and thousands more have been seriously injured. 'I suspect that the British people - and. not just the British people - will be wary of enduring engagements on. this kind of scale for perhaps quite a long while in the future,' Mr. Hammond said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 'You might call it the Vietnam. phenomenon - when an engagement turns out to be longer and more costly. than originally envisaged, there is often a public reaction to that.' Mr Hammond added the true lesson from. Afghanistan may be that a prolonged military commitment could have been. avoided if the West had been prepared to intervene earlier before al. Qaida launched its attack on the Twin Towers. 'We ourselves have learned the lesson. that earlier, smaller scale intervention may often avoid the need for. more massive intervention later, and if we are in a mood for beating. ourselves up, perhaps we should have foreseen the consequences of what. was happening in Afghanistan before 9/11,' he said. 'Perhaps we should have been more. forward leaning in the West collectively in intervening to try and head. off what was happening here before it happened.' Combat fatigue: the Defence Secretary warned this weekend that the British people had become weary of the UK's involvement in overseas operations. On patrol: British soldiers have been involved in active operations in Afghanistan for 12 years. Earlier this week Mr Cameron raised the prospect of weapons falling into terrorist hands. ‘Elements affiliated to al-Qaeda in the. region have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for probable use in. Syria,’ the Prime Minister said. Britain is currently providing. ‘non-lethal’ equipment to the Syrian rebels but Foreign Secretary. William Hague has, with the support of France, been working had to lift a. European Union arms embargo. US confirmation of British and French. reports that the Syrian army was using chemical weapons against the. rebels has increased the prospect of weapons being passed to the rebels. Mr Hague said earlier this week the West 'must do more’ to put pressure on the. Assad regime to reach a peaceful settlement with the rebels and stop the. bloodshed which the UN says has so far cost in excess of 93,000 lives. The Defence Secretary’s comments also. come at a time when he is being asked to make even more cuts to his. department as part of the Chancellor’s comprehensive spending review. His is one of the few departments yet to have agree cuts at part of the. review. Last month Mr Hammond publicly warned any further cuts to his. department would come at a cost to Britain’s military capability. Under current. budget cuts Army personnel will have been cut by a fifth to 82,000, their. lowest level since the end of the 19th century.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \\"quiet\\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \\"Crunch Effect.\\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \\"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\\" Elder said. \\"The effects may not...

Context: The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.

Find a way to connect these concepts: - It makes sense that a barn could be surrounded by vegetation since barns are typically found on farms or rural settings, where vegetation is common. 3. Create a sentence that includes all three concepts: - \\"The old red barn was surrounded by lush green vegetation, creating a picturesque scene in the countryside.\\" In this sentence, I've used all three given words, and the concepts are logically connected.

Context: I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

If I tell you that Houses have disappeared because of precipitation, and ask you the question \\"houses have disappeared because of what?\\", is the correct answer \\"physical weathering\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer would not be \\"physical weathering.\\" While physical weathering might have a role in the overall degradation and ultimate disappearance of houses over time, it would not alone solely account for houses disappearing due to precipitation. To provide a more comprehensive and detailed answer, we have to consider the following factors and explanations: 1. Precipitation refers to any form of water that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface; it includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Precipitation can lead to several types of problems for houses, particularly when it is excessive, or there is poor drainage or inadequate protection for the structure. 2. One possible explanation for the disappearance of houses due to precipitation could be erosion. When precipitation falls on the ground and begins to flow downhill, it might erode away the soil, which may cause instability in the foundations of houses, ultimately leading to their collapse or disappearance. This, however, typically occurs over an extended period rather than instantly. 3. Another potential factor behind houses disappearing due to precipitation is flooding. Heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt can cause rivers, streams, and other bodies of water to overflow their banks, leading to inundation of nearby areas. If houses are located in low-lying or flood-prone regions, they may be severely damaged or even be swept away entirely during floods. 4. In addition to erosion and flooding, landslides and mudslides could also explain the disappearance of houses due to precipitation. These events can occur when the ground becomes saturated with water, and its stability is compromised. The increased weight of the water-laden soil, combined with gravitational forces, can cause the land to give way, burying or destroying homes in its path. 5. Finally, it's worth mentioning that precipitation can contribute to the process of physical weathering of the construction materials, as repeated cycles of wetting and drying, as well as freeze-thaw cycles, can lead to cracks, crumbling, and eventual decay of buildings. However, this process takes place over an extended period and typically does not cause the sudden disappearance of a house. Therefore, while \\"physical weathering\\" might have a role in the overall degradation and disappearance of houses, it is not the sole explanation for houses disappearing due to precipitation. Instead, the answer should encompass the various factors such as erosion, flooding, landslides, and mudslides, which could potentially cause houses to disappear in the context of heavy precipitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This can be broken down into the following sub-steps: 1. Formation of urine: After the kidneys have processed the blood, separated waste, and returned the filtered fluid back to the bloodstream, the waste products combined with excess water form urine. The urinary system is composed of several different structures that aid in the formation and excretion of urine, including the nephrons (the functional units of the kidneys), the renal tubules, and the collecting ducts. 2. Transport of urine: Once urine is formed, it needs to be transported out of the kidneys. The urine flows from the renal tubules into the collecting ducts and then leaves the kidneys through the ureters, two muscular tubes that connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 3. Storage of urine: The urine moves from the ureters into the urinary bladder, a hollow, muscular organ that expands as urine fills it. The bladder stores the urine until it is full and the person feels the need to urinate. 4. Excretion of urine: When the urinary bladder is full, nerve signals initiate the process of micturition (urination), during which the muscles of the bladder wall contract and the internal urethral sphincter relaxes. This action causes the opening of the urethra, the tube through which urine exits the body, and allows the urine to flow out, effectively eliminating waste products from the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the elimination of waste in the form of urine, which is accomplished by forming urine from waste products and excess water, transporting the urine out of the kidneys and into the urinary bladder, storing the urine until the bladder is full, and then excreting the urine from the body through the urethra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Shares in Admiral fell 6% after the insurer said the rising cost of personal injury claims hit profits.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Admiral Insurance Faces 6% Drop in Shares Amid Rising Personal Injury Claims Costs Introduction: Admiral Insurance, a leading insurance provider, has recently experienced a 6% drop in shares as it revealed the growing burden of personal injury claims affecting profits. The company, which offers a broad range of insurance products, such as car, home, travel, and pet insurance, has been caught in the upward trend of rising personal injury claim costs. This development may have far-reaching implications for the insurance industry and customers, alike. In this article, we explore the factors that led to the decline in shares, the steady increase in personal injury claim costs, and the potential consequences of this trend for the insurance industry and policyholders. Factors Leading to the 6% Drop in Shares: The decline in Admiral's share prices can be attributed to various factors. First and foremost, the announcement of the connection between the increased personal injury claims expenditures and the impact on profits led investors to reconsider their positions on the company's stock. Investors may see this drastic increase in claim costs as a reflection of the insurer's inability to manage claims expenses efficiently or as the revelation of a wider industry problem that could result in further profit declines in the future. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainty in the economic landscape, fueled by the global pandemic, has added another layer of apprehension for investors. The pandemic has disrupted various industries, including insurance, where it has led to delays in claim resolution, significant premium adjustments, and unforeseen expenses related to remote work and business operations. This uncertainty may have played a role in investors' decision-making processes, resulting in the sale of stocks, thereby contributing to the 6% fall in shares. The Rising Cost of Personal Injury Claims: The primary reason for the decline in Admiral's shares is the impact of rising personal injury claim costs on the insurer's profits. Several factors contribute to these increased costs, including: 1. Legal Reforms: Accidents or injuries resulting in personal injury claims may entail a legal battle, depending largely on the nature and severity of the case. Legal reforms, such as those in the UK with the Civil Liability Act 2018, have been aimed at reducing the number of fraudulent claims and lowering legal fees. However, these reforms have inadvertently led to higher compensation payouts for genuine claims, which has had a negative impact on insurers' financial health. 2. Medical Inflation: Medical treatments are becoming more expensive, and claimants seek compensation for these exorbitant costs. As a result, insurance providers have to grapple with the escalating payouts for claimants, which subsequently affects their bottom line. 3. Greater Public Awareness: With increased societal awareness around personal injury claims, more people are pursuing compensation for injuries sustained in accidents. This higher volume of claims puts additional pressure on insurers to pay out more in compensation while also managing their claim costs efficiently. 4. Rising Litigation Costs: The legal process for settling personal injury claims can be intricate, and the associated costs continue to climb. The increase in legal costs adds financial strain on insurance companies and may force them to increase premiums to cover these expenses. Implications for the Insurance Industry and Customers: The rising cost of personal injury claims and the subsequent drop in Admiral's shares signal serious consequences for the insurance industry as a whole. Insurance providers may be forced to reassess their risk management strategies and work towards efficient claim handling processes. Moreover, they may need to explore the implementation of advanced technologies and automation to streamline claim-handling processes and reduce costs. Furthermore, insurers might have to reevaluate their premium rates, potentially leading to increased premiums for customers. For policyholders, this could translate to higher insurance costs, and they may have to reconsider their coverage options and the affordability of various insurance products. Conclusion: The 6% drop in Admiral's shares serves as an important milestone in the ongoing struggle faced by the insurance industry with rising personal injury claim costs. This development may force insurers to reevaluate their risk management strategies, implement changes to improve efficiency in handling claims, and reconsider their premium rates. For policyholders, the rising costs could lead to a tough choice of ensuring adequate coverage against the increasing expenses associated with insurance products. It remains to be seen how the insurance market will evolve to combat this issue, and whether the appropriate balance between risk management, cost containment, and consumer affordability will be achieved in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A couple of years ago, my dad told me that he had a cataract in his eye and could barely see out of it and that he needed to get it fixed. \\"Cool. Go to the doctor and get it taken care of,\\" I said. \\"I will,\\" he replied. One month became three; three months turned into six months; and a year later and numerous calls later by a ticked-off son, he still had not gone to the doctor. So one morning, when I was hosting the 6 to 9 a.m. talk show shift on WVON-AM in Chicago, Illinois, I told my producer, Geneen Harston, to call my dad, but don't tell him he'll be on the air. When the commercials ended, I pulled him up on the air and asked, \\"So, dad, have you made that doctor's appointment?\\" He started to laugh and said that he had done so the day before and that he was seeing the doctor later in the week. Luckily, he followed through, and they discovered that he had another one growing in the other eye. Both eyes were taken care of, and all has been well since. Yet what ticked me off was that here was a guy with insurance, a son who could pay for the bill even if he didn't, but he still refused to go to the doctor! Watch Roland's commentary segment ».

Men are dying earlier due to prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke and other maladies, and their actions play a large role in it. Black men in particular drive me nuts. I've heard several mention that their aversion to doctors stems from the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, the study conducted between 1932 and 1972 that monitored black sharecroppers who were infected with the disease but didn't treat them, much less inform them that they had it. That program by the U.S. Public Health Service was hideous but shouldn't be used as an excuse today. Men can no longer be so hard-headed about their health.

Although the author's father eventually went to the doctor due to the author's persistent urging, it was discovered that he had another cataract growing in his other eye. This behaviour is characteristic of many men who are stubborn and refuse to visit doctors, often leading to health conditions getting worse or being detected at later stages. The author emphasises on the importance of regular health check-ups and early detection, and criticises the harmful masculinity stereotype of enduring pain or dismissing potential health issues. He highlights the unfortunate fact that men in general, and black men in particular, have a well-documented aversion to seeking professional healthcare which leads to a lower life expectancy compared to women. He also denounces the tendency to use historical events such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment as an excuse to avoid medical checks and screening. The author encourages both men to change these attitudes, and others to proactively prompt the men in their lives to seek regular health checkups. He suggest creative tactics such as making certain privileges conditional upon health checkups. With the underlying message being that prevention is better than cure, the author asserts that, if necessary, more aggressive reminders and incentives should be used, as the ultimate goal is to save lives and improve health. Finally, the author points out that this perspective is his own and may not be representative of the broader population but hopes that it stirs discussion and consideration towards men's health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Trying to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Steelers went home for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Seattle Seahawks, in the rematch of Super Bowl XL. Going into the game, Pittsburgh was without Hines Ward, Santonio Holmes, Troy Polomalu, and Casey Hampton, due to injuries. After a scoreless first quarter, the Steelers drew first blood with QB Ben Roethlisberger completing a 13-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller to lead 7-0 at halftime. In the second half, Pittsburgh completed the shutout with RB Najeh Davenport running 1&#160;yard for a TD in the third quarter and 5&#160;yards for a TD in the fourth. With the win, Pittsburgh entered its bye week at 4-1. During the game, the Steelers had over 40&#160;minutes of possession, including 25&#160;minutes of the second half. In their first five games Pittsburgh had outscored its opponents 57-6 in the first half. The Steelers also improved to 4-0 on the year when RB Willie Parker has a 100-yard rushing game, as he ran 28 times for 102&#160;yards.

Context: Sin is no trivial thing to be casually swept aside , as in the gospel of cheap grace . The salvation of the soul is the miraculous deed of undeserved and incalculable mercy . A false gospel creates false Christians , and we must be wary of falling prey to the delusion , or of perpetrating it through a false message that wins human favour ( widespread but wide of the mark ) but denies its believers the favour of God . Question What is the subject of the narrator 's lecture ? Possible answers: pick from the following. (a). The narrator is talking of movies .. (b). The narrator is talking of morals .. (c). None of the above choices .. (d). The narrator is talking of love .. The answer:","completion":"(b). The narrator is talking of morals. Explanation: The narrator is discussing sin, salvation of the soul, false gospels, and the importance of staying true to the right message. This is related to morals as it deals with the beliefs about what is right and wrong. (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the passage does not discuss movies, love, or suggest that the topic is unrelated to the options provided.
