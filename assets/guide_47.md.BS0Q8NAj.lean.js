Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim? ? During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to re-orchestrate several... Answer:","completion":"During his visit to Mannheim in 1777, Mozart heard a performance of Handel's work, \\"Messiah.\\" The composition, which had been gaining popularity in festivals, cathedrals, and concerts and had been incorporated into church services as anthems, motets, or concert pieces, left its mark on Mozart who encountered it for the first time in Mannheim. The \\"Messiah\\" was not performed in its original form but as a revised and re-orchestrated version to fit the prevalent tastes of the time. The performances that Handel himself oversaw, and those that occurred in the decades following his death, commonly involved large musical forces akin to what Burrows suggested as typical for the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754. Beginning in 1784, a trend for larger scale performances developed. This was exemplified by the series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music in Westminster Abbey under King George III's patronage, where a monumental group of at least 525 performers participated. In the rest of Continental Europe, a different form of departure from Handel's practice was noticeable, where original works were being significantly re-orchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. Hiller, for example, presented a revised and drastically re-orchestrated version of \\"Messiah\\" in Berlin Cathedral in 1786 and again in 1788, involving hundreds of performers. This massive re-orchestration and the large-scale performances offer a clue to what Mozart might have heard in Mannheim: a version of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" performed by a sizeable ensemble in a modified arrangement reflecting the musical preferences of the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Senate advances unemployment benefits extension bill The Senate voted 60-37 to advance the unemployment extension bill. WASHINGTON — The Senate opened 2014 by narrowly voting to advance a bill extending federal unemployment benefits for three months, in a move President Obama and his Democratic allies hope will launch an ongoing bid to combat economic inequality. It was a dramatic win for Democrats, who entered the Tuesday morning vote pessimistic about their chances. They picked up support from six Republican senators. RELATED: SENATOR SUES TO STOP PAY FOR CONGRESS MEMBERS’ INSURANCE The 60-37 vote may set up passage of the measure later this week and Democrats hope it will put pressure on the Republican-run House. But GOP leaders there have said they will only back the three-month extension of the benefits if its 6.5 billion cost is offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Shortly after the procedural vote, President Obama praised the Senate's move and urged Congress to follow suit. “Unemployment insurance has been a vital economic lifeline,” Obama said. “For a lot of people it’s the only source of income they have to support their families while they look for a job.” “These aren’t people who are just sitting back waiting for things to happen. They desperately want work,” he added. “There’s still a lot of people struggling out there ... Congress should make things right.” Democrats plan this year to push other bills they say aim to address inequality, including a proposed minimum wage hike. They hope to they will either force Republicans to accept Obama's agenda or face fallout in the 2014 midterm elections from an electorate that appears increasingly concerned about economic fairness. RELATED: GOP SENATE CANDIDATE WANTS TO MOVE NATIONAL CAPITAL TO NEBRASKA But on Tuesday, top Republicans stood firm on demands for a benefits extension to be fully paid for. \\"Another extension of temporary emergency unemployment benefits should not only be paid for but include something to help put people back to work,\\" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday. And Until Obama offers such a plan, Boehner added, “the House is going to remain focused on growing the economy and giving America’s unemployed the independence that only comes from finding a good job.\\" More than 1.3 million Americans are losing federal unemployment aid they received after exhausting state jobless aid. Most states offer six months of unemployment insurance. The federal program expired on Dec. 28. It's the first time since Congress launched the emergency program in 2008 that federal unemployment benefits lapsed. RELATED: FLA. REP. TREY RADEL RETURNING TO CONGRESS AFTER REHAB Democrats have leaped on claims by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is eyeing a 2016 presidential bid, that extending unemployment benefits would be a \\"disservice\\" to jobless people because it would discourage them from seeking jobs. \\"You're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy,\\" Paul said on Fox News Sunday, prompting a stern dismissal from Obama. RELATED: CONGRESSIONAL GRIDLOCK EXPECTED TO WORSEN \\"I can’t name a time when I met an American who would rather have an unemployment check than the pride of having a job,\\" Obama said during his Tuesday remarks. \\"The long-term unemployed are not lazy. They are not lacking in motivation. They are coping with the aftermath of the worst economic crisis in generations.\\" “We’ve got to get this across the finish line without obstruction or delay and we need the House of Representatives to be able to vote for it as well,” Obama said. \\"That’s the bottom line.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Given the below context: Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and wetland forests in which Native Americans fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the Clackamas River basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.By the middle of the 19th century, the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.

Kaki King (born Katherine Elizabeth King, August 24, 1979) is an American guitarist and composer. King is known for her percussive and jazz-tinged melodies, energetic live shows, use of multiple tunings on acoustic and lap steel guitar, and her diverse range in different genres. In February 2006, Rolling Stone released a list of \\"The New Guitar Gods\\", on which King was the sole woman and youngest artist (beating Derek Trucks in age by two months as the youngest on the list). In addition to a 10-year career that includes six LP and two EP albums, King has also scored music for television and film. At the end of her tour for Legs to Make Us Longer in 2005, King departed from her previous musical direction out of a desire to escape being pigeonholed as a solo instrumental artist. She amicably parted ways with major label Sony/Epic and returned to her original label, Velour, to begin work on her third album ...Until We Felt Red. Released August 8, 2006, on Velour Records, the album features production work by Tortoise's John McEntire. With the prominence of electric guitar shoegazing and effect boxes on the new record, and the addition of a full band, the music website, The A.V. Club, called the sound a \\"post-rock makeover.\\" She supported the album by going on tour with Sarah Bettens from K's Choice. In early 2007, Dave Grohl invited King to appear as a guitarist on the track \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\", a song penned by Grohl for an upcoming studio album by the Foo Fighters. King agreed and is credited on the album, entitled Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, released on September 25, 2007. On November 18, 2007, she joined Dave Grohl on stage to perform the track at the O2 arena in London. Grohl highly praised King's performance: \\"There are some guitar players that are good and there are some guitar players that are really fucking good. And then there's Kaki King.\\" King toured with the Foo Fighters on the Australian leg of the Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace tour. While on tour, King finished recording what became the Day Sleeper (Australian tour EP). It was released in late 2007 after King had finished working on August Rush, and with Eddie Vedder and Sean Penn on Into The Wild.

After winning over the Browns, the Steelers traveled further west to take on the Colts in a rematch of 2015's 45-10 blowout win. The Steelers struck first in the first quarter when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 5-yard touchdown to take a 7-0 lead. This would be followed by Ben Roethlisberger finding Antonio Brown on a 25-yard touchdown pass later on in the quarter to make it 14-0. The Colts got on the board in the second quarter when QB Scott Tolzien, starting in place of the injured Andrew Luck, found Donte Moncrief on a 5-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-7. However, the Steelers pulled away as Roethlisberger found Brown again this time on a 33-yard touchdown pass for a 21-7 lead at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, the Steelers sealed the game with the only points in the second half when Roethlisberger found Brown again this time on a 22-yard touchdown pass and the eventual final score of 28-7.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Options: - When they are fasting - When they are traveling - not enough information - When they are eating a high protein meal === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"When they are traveling."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: St James Holdings Limited is a company set up by which English billionaire retail entrepreneur in the sporting goods market?

Options: - windows 95 - school - ammunition shop - office supply store - desk The answer is \\"office supply store\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"Office supply store\\" because an office supply store specializes in providing various office-related items and equipment that are essential for the smooth functioning of day-to-day activities, be it for personal use, use in schools and colleges, or businesses. One of the common and most sought-after items in an office supply store is a clipboard, which is a significant accessory for maintaining documents in an organized manner. Firstly, let's take a look at the provided options and understand why the other options might not be suitable for Sam to get more clipboards: - Windows 95: Windows 95 is a long-outdated operating system software developed by Microsoft. It was released in 1995 as part of the Windows operating system family. It is unrelated to clipboards or any physical office supplies. Rather, it’s a software with no connection to the current hardware need. - School: While it's true that schools might have clipboards in their inventory, they are not the ideal place for Sam to acquire more clipboards. Schools are educational institutions meant for learning and not for retail sale of office supplies. Moreover, even if Sam is affiliated with a school, it would make more sense for him to buy clipboards from a dedicated store rather than sourcing it from within the school's inventory. - Ammunition shop: An ammunition shop primarily deals with the sale of firearms, ammunition, and other tactical gear. It is an unlikely place to find clipboards as their primary focus lies in catering to the needs of gun enthusiasts and law enforcement personnel, rather than providing office supplies. - Desk: A desk, be it at home or in the office, might have a couple of clipboards lying around, but this doesn't mean that it would have an adequate supply of clipboards if Sam were to run out of them. A desk is a piece of furniture that provides space for work and storage, but it is not a location where additional clipboards can be sourced if needed. Now, focusing on why the office supply store is the most appropriate option: - Office supply store: Office supply stores are dedicated to providing a wide range of office essentials, including stationery, furniture, storage solutions, and various office accessories. The primary reason Sam would choose an office supply store to get more clipboards is that such stores offer a variety of options in terms of size, material, and design. Sam can easily find a suitable clipboard that meets his requirements and preferences. Additionally, office supply stores often provide volume discounts and cater to bulk orders, which might be beneficial if Sam requires a large number of clipboards. In conclusion, an office supply store is the most logical and convenient place for Sam to obtain more clipboards as it focuses on offering diverse office related products, meeting a wide range of preferences and requirements. On the other hand, other options like Windows 95, school, ammunition shop, and desk either don't provide any connection to the hardware or serve a different purpose altogether, making them inappropriate choices for Sam's needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car.

Anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said 32 were killed in one district alone. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is supporting Kurdish-led fighters seeking to capture Raqqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance launched a ground assault in early June and is now believed to hold more than half of the city, which is the de facto capital of the \\"caliphate\\" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The Syrian Observatory, a UK-based group that monitors the six-year-old civil war through a network of sources, said on Tuesday that 19 children and 12 women were among those killed in Monday's air raids on the Sukhani and Badu districts. The figures took to 167 the number of civilians killed in coalition strikes since 14 August, it said. \\"The tolls are high because the air strikes are hitting neighbourhoods in the city centre that are densely packed with civilians,\\" Syrian Observatory director Rami Abdul Rahman told AFP news agency. \\"There are buildings full of civilians that are trying to get away from the front lines.\\" The coalition has not yet responded to the report, but said it had conducted 20 air strikes in the Raqqa area on Monday, engaging 13 IS tactical units and destroying 24 fighting positions, a vehicle, a logistics node and communications infrastructure. At the start of June, the coalition said its 22,983 air strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014 had unintentionally killed at least 624 civilians. However, human rights groups believe the true figure is far higher. Airwars, an organisation that tracks allegations of civilian deaths, said that as of 8 August, coalition air strikes were likely to have killed at least 4,487 civilians in three years. On Monday, UN spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric told reporters that it was deeply concerned for the safety of up to 25,000 civilians trapped inside Raqqa, many of them women and children. Tens of thousands of people had fled the city, but those remaining faced severe restrictions of movement in and out of the city, which had dwindling food and water supplies, he said. \\"The UN stresses again that all parties to the fighting are obligated to protect civilians under international humanitarian law, as well as the need for sustained and unhindered access to those who need help,\\" Mr Dujarric added.","completion":"At least 42 civilians were killed in Raqqa, Syria, in air strikes conducted by a US-led coalition on areas held by the Islamic State, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The key terms in the tweet are 'Boreddddd' and 'got my Camera today.' Step 2: Analyze each key term for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). 'Boreddddd' indicates a negative sentiment as it expresses the feeling of boredom. 'got my Camera today' indicates a positive sentiment as it expresses the satisfaction of acquiring a new item (a camera). Step 3: Combine the sentiments of each key term. In this step, we need to consider whether the sentiments expressed by the key terms are strong enough to impact the overall sentiment of the tweet or whether they are neutralized by each other. In this case, the negative sentiment of 'Boreddddd' is not strong enough to negate the positive sentiment of 'got my Camera today.' Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. As the positive sentiment outweighs the negative sentiment, the overall sentiment of the tweet is positive.

New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The initial release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\", backed with \\"In a Lonely Place\\". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: \\"I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.\\" New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, \\"Everything's Gone Green\\" and \\"Temptation\\", saw a change in direction toward dance music. The Hacienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled \\"Prime 5 8 6\\", but released 15 years later as \\"Video 5 8 6\\". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, \\"Prime 5 8 6\\"/\\"Video 5 8 6\\" was an early version of \\"5 8 6\\" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"Ultraviolence\\". 1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, brandishing \\"The Perfect Kiss\\"--the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme--and \\"Sub-culture\\". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring \\"Shellshock\\" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of \\"Thieves Like Us\\" and the instrumental \\"Elegia\\" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex. Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK \\"True Faith\\" CD video single, under the title \\"Evil Dust\\"), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single \\"True Faith\\". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\"--referred to as \\"Temptation '87\\" and \\"Confusion '87\\". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides \\"Procession\\" and \\"Murder\\". The single, \\"True Faith\\", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, \\"1963\\"--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release \\"True Faith\\" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions. In December 1987, the band released a further single, \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order. The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, \\"We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out.\\" By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's Reading Festival. Their 2001 release Get Ready largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, \\"Get Ready was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time.\\" Longtime fan Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track \\"Turn My Way,\\" and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track \\"Rock the Shack\\". Singles from the album included Crystal, 60 Miles an Hour and Someone Like You. In 2002, Q featured New Order on their list of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \\"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\\". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of The Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including Happy Mondays and The Durutti Column.

The Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, saw the United States intervening in the conflict between North and South Vietnam. The intervention aimed to prevent the spread of communism in the region, but the war ultimately resulted in heavy casualties and a tremendous loss of resources for both the U.S. and Vietnam. With the fall of Saigon in 1975, the United States withdrew from the conflict and diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed. Since then, the U.S. and Vietnam have made significant efforts to rebuild and nurture diplomatic ties, ultimately reestablishing formal relations in 1995. Reconciliation and cooperation initiatives have been pursued in areas such as trade, investment, education, and cultural exchange. The resumption of commercial flights after decades serves as a powerful symbol of the progress made between the two nations. The landing of the United Airlines plane in Ho Chi Minh City suggests a continuation of positive developments in U.S.-Vietnam relations. As the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the war, this event highlights how far both nations have come in terms of moving beyond the painful memories and divisions of the past. This progress is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation across various sectors, including economic partnerships, security matters, and cultural connections. In summary, the text discusses the arrival of a United Airlines plane in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, marking the first commercial American flight to the nation since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. This event underscores the ongoing process of reconciliation and normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam, reflecting the significant strides both countries have taken to move forward from the shared history of conflict and towards a more collaborative and peaceful future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is contraindicated in those with <1-year life expectancy.', 'The aim of this study was to develop a risk prediction score for 1-year mortality in patients with primary prevention ICDs and to determine the incremental improvement in discrimination when serum-based biomarkers are added to traditional clinical variables.', 'We analyzed data from the Prospective Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators, a large prospective observational study of patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who were extensively phenotyped for clinical and serum-based biomarkers. We identified variables predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized them into a comprehensive risk scoring construct using backward selection.', 'Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 2.7%, 16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively. Answer: Individuals with more comorbidities and elevation of specific serum biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause mortality despite being deemed as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A simple risk score composed of readily available clinical data and serum biomarkers may better identify patients at high risk of early mortality and improve patient selection and counseling for primary prevention ICD therapy.

Israel's politics of fear It feels like ancient history now, but in 1993 – the year of the Oslo Accords – Israel’s prime minister Yitzakh Rabin judged that his country was ready to make a momentous choice. Israelis, he confided to the author and politician Shlomo Ben-Ami, were tired of war. Secular and pragmatic, the young generation dreamed of a life of prosperity and normalcy their parents had never known. Israel, he reasoned, was emerging as a place of individualism, hedonism, even – to use a phrase then in vogue – \\"post-Zionism\\". As a result of these changes, Zionism is in the ascendancy again – but in a new, coarsened form. Whereas it was once informed by the collectivist ethos handed down from the first, pioneering generation of Israeli state-builders, the Zionism of Benjamin Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett is rooted in something much more primal: fear. Like all demagogues, Netanyahu (who is sure to remain prime minister after the vote) knows the value of fear, and has spent the last four years frightening his people with the spectre of Iranian nukes, Palestinian terror and international anti-semitism. Even the squandering of his country’s most valuable strategic asset – its close relationship with the White House – has strengthened the Right, convincing voters that Israel is alone in a hostile world and must look inward for strength and safety. But this nationalist mood belies the fact that Israel is, in many ways, splitting at the seams. Trust – between Israelis and in their elected leaders – is at an all-time low. Two-and-a-half decades of privatisation and deregulation have turned it from among the most egalitarian of countries to the most unequal in the Western world, alongside the United States. Meanwhile outgoing foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, currently facing charges of fraud, is just the latest Israeli leader who seems to spend as much time fighting lawsuits as making laws. As society becomes less equitable and the political class grows more squalid and corrupt, fewer Israelis than ever say they value the good of society above their personal interests: 28 per cent today, down from 64 per cent at the beginning of the 80s. The paradox of Israel today is that the more fractured and atomised it becomes, the more it glues itself together by resorting to a belligerent form of nationalism. It is a country that projects its insecurity outwards, finding a comforting unity only in the face of external perils, real or imagined. The irony is that, with the West Bank pacified and the Gaza front quiet, the threat from Palestinian terror is at an all-time low. When Israelis glance up at the lengthening shadows on the iron wall they have erected around themselves, the shapes that increasingly menace them are their own.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: When Greg Smith resigned in March as an executive director and vice president of Goldman Sachs with an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, he leveled some sweeping charges: Goldman’s culture was “toxic and destructive”; the firm promoted “morally bankrupt people”; and — most devastating to any professional organization — Goldman Sachs bankers were “ripping their clients off.” Mr. Smith’s letter clearly hit a popular nerve, coming as it did during a devastating financial crisis in which Goldman emerged as the rich, arrogant and unfeeling perpetrator of much of the financial wreckage still afflicting Americans. And it’s hard to quarrel with Mr. Smith’s overriding message: Wall Street should put clients interests’ first or risk oblivion. Indeed, that was Goldman Sachs’s own credo, “Our clients’ interests always come first.” But stripped of its incendiary conclusions, Mr. Smith’s manifesto was curiously short on facts. Other than the now-infamous reference to muppets — “I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as ‘muppets,’ sometimes over internal e-mail” — there were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off. Mr. Smith declined to elaborate after the article was published, heightening suspense and no doubt fueling the literary bidding that reached a reported 1.5 million for a book that would deliver the goods. That book, “Why I Left Goldman Sachs,” goes on sale on Monday. Despite tight security, copies of the book have been circulating, and I read one. The book not only fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions, but he admits changing “names or descriptors” for some (but not all) people and acknowledges that what he does disclose is “from memory.” He says he has tried “to retain the spirit” of what actually occurred. This makes it nearly impossible to verify much of what he says. Beyond that, from his perch on the equity trading desk he seems to have had a narrow view of the institution where he worked for nearly 12 years. His disillusionment comes across as heartfelt, but much of it seems to have come less from his own experiences than from news reports about the firm’s behavior in deals he wasn’t involved in. Mr. Smith’s book might even bolster Goldman’s reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn’t made much of a case. But Mr. Smith isn’t in much of a position to exonerate Goldman, either. The firm was deeply enmeshed in nearly all aspects of the financial crisis and its causes, including mortgage-backed securities. And after an injection of taxpayer support, it managed to profit handsomely and pay the lavish bonuses that Mr. Smith shared in. But you won’t find that story in “Why I Left.” Mr. Smith declined to discuss any of this before his scheduled appearance on Sunday on “60 Minutes.” Goldman Sachs responded to some of my questions with copies of parts of their internal investigation and made several employees available. Potential problems with Mr. Smith’s approach surface almost immediately. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 describes “an intern named Josh” who’s being “grilled” and asked to explain risk arbitrage but “was floundering badly.” Josh, Mr. Smith adds, is the son of a billionaire. There was no “Josh” in Mr. Smith’s group of interns, and only one son of a billionaire: Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group. “I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,” Mr. Schwarzman said when I contacted him this week. “I realize it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.” Nor did anyone else in the class I spoke to recall such an episode. Mr. Smith also recounts what purports to be a verbatim exchange between a Goldman vice president and a fellow intern named Brynn Thomas who graduated from Brown University. Brynn is interrogated and humiliated by her lack of knowledge about Microsoft, and “starts to tear up and runs out of the room.” Goldman said it has no record of anyone named Brynn Thomas, and other members of Mr. Smith’s intern class said no one by that name was in his class. Nor did they recall any such incident. “The program wasn’t that cutthroat, and it certainly wasn’t abusive,” said Mr. Schwarzman, now a movie producer. “No one ever ran out of a room crying. They were trying to recruit us and also to shape us. They had high expectations, but I learned a tremendous amount.” (The actual person apparently described in the anecdote, a Brown graduate named Ebony Thomas who was an intern with Mr. Smith, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) On the larger issue of whether Goldman was “ripping off” clients, his principal evidence is that while he was working in London in the two years before his resignation, Goldman was urging clients to buy or sell options on European banks while countries like Greece and Portugal were in the midst of debt crises. In Mr. Smith’s telling, Goldman was trying to get clients to take positions that Goldman was trying to get rid of, which Mr. Smith describes as “axes.” “The firm believes, deep down, that one outcome is going to transpire, yet it advises the client to do the opposite, so the firm can then take the other side of the trade and implement its own proprietary bet.” But Goldman officials told me the firm never acted as a principal on any of those trades, and Mr. Smith doesn’t provide any specific examples where it did. Moreover, they noted, Mr. Smith sold United States equities and derivatives while he was in London, not European ones, so he would have had no direct knowledge of European options trading. Mr. Smith also faults Goldman for constantly changing its views on the outlook for European banks, requiring clients to keep trading and presumably generating more commissions for the firm. “No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently. It was so obviously misleading and disingenuous,” he writes. But Goldman officials said that anyone immersed in the European debt crisis and government responses at the time would understand that conditions changed frequently, and it was Goldman’s obligation to keep clients informed. As for muppets — a mildly derogatory term common in British slang — Goldman officials said they had conducted an exhaustive search after Mr. Smith resigned. They said they found only one such reference to a client, and it was about educating the client, a midsize European bank, not taking advantage of it. The mere mention of Mr. Smith invokes passionate reactions at Goldman, but much of the initial anger seems to have dissipated. People I spoke to who had been close to him felt hurt, wronged and saddened by a broadside from someone they considered a friend and colleague, dedicated to the firm and its values, who was hard-working, reliable and humble. He seemed, they said, the last person to attack the firm and its culture. One of Mr. Smith’s fellow interns said, “I thought he loved the firm and its culture.” The former intern, now a managing director, said he helped organize a going-away party for him at SPiN, a Manhattan club with 17 Ping-Pong tables. (Mr. Smith was a table tennis champion in his native South Africa.) “In his book he makes every element of our intern program seem demeaning,” the former intern said. “It was intense and stressful, but it was fun. And we learned so much.” He showed me a yearbook he had saved from that summer with several photos of a beaming Mr. Smith. The Goldman officials I spoke to all asked not to be named because they didn’t want to be drawn into a public debate about the book. A partner who said he acted in many ways as Mr. Smith’s mentor and was in regular contact with him until shortly before he left, said: “He never raised any issue with me. I had no inkling. I thought he’d settled in in London and was doing fine. I know he was disappointed he hadn’t been made a managing director yet, but he just wasn’t ready. For some people it’s a sprint, but it took me 18 years to make managing director and 20 years to make partner. I told him to keep at it and good things will happen. Serve clients and they’ll serve you. Give them good ideas. London was a great opportunity for him, and I thought he was excited.” One thing Mr. Smith was clearly unhappy about was his compensation, which had peaked at 500,000 and, like the compensation of most Goldman employees, had recently declined slightly. After he asked for a 1 million bonus, his supervisor wrote in an e-mail, “Greg Smith off the charts unrealistic, thinks he shld trade at multiples, we told him there’s v little tolerance for reactions like that and he needs to tone it down.” The partner told me this week: “He was an outlier in London. Most people were disappointed but realistic. He had a complete disconnect from the macro environment. Europe wanted to outlaw bonuses. They were discussing bonus caps. We were laying people off. People were very sensitive to this.” The former intern added, “I was floored; I was beyond shocked” by Mr. Smith’s resignation and accusations. “He was making 500,000 at the age of 26 or 27 at a time when people were being laid off, and he complains? I can only conclude he was motivated by personal gain. The firm has been under attack, and I think he’s being opportunistic. None of it feels virtuous to me.” Virtuous or not, “Why I Left” will surely not be the last word — good or bad — on Goldman. Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader at the center of a now-infamous subprime mortgage deal, is scheduled to go on trial for civil fraud next July. Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Tourre was involved in a deal in which Goldman misled investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said. That deal has come to embody many of the excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble — something that actually did help cause the financial crisis. Mr. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing and is on unpaid leave from Goldman while studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago and doing volunteer work in Rwanda. Mr. Tourre hasn’t signed a seven-figure book deal, but he could surely get one — and if he does, it could be a tell-all worth reading. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Should Goldman Sachs care about Greg Smith’s book? While “Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story” does not contain any explosive accusations of wrongdoing, it does lay bare at least one man’s view of how the firm’s culture went haywire over the last decade. The believability of his story could have a long-term effect on the firm and its ability to recruit and retain new talent. Mr. Smith’s book is being released on Monday and was the subject of a segment on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night. On that program, Mr. Smith said Goldman, like other firms, started several years ago to use client information to bet with its own money, sometimes against its own clients. Getting an unsophisticated client, he said, became the “golden prize” because the “quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.” Goldman rejects Mr. Smith’s claims, saying, “We have taken a look at those claims as they relate to his business and found no evidence whatsoever to support them.” Mr. Smith had a seat in the trenches as Goldman evolved from an old line investment bank into a trading power house. He was influenced, as most employees everywhere are, by both things he saw during his time there and by events he read about in the news. CBS News/60 Minutes “I knew in my heart there was simply something deeply wrong with the way people were behaving, in the way they didn’t care about the repercussions, in the way they saw their clients as adversaries,” Mr. Smith wrote in his book. “My human reaction was that it was bad for the future of the firm, a place that I had put lot of heart and soul into.” On the one hand, Mr. Smith comes across as naïve. Yes, there is gambling going on at the casino. But Goldman has long stood out on Wall Street for its ability to hang onto the partnership culture it had before it went public in 1999. That culture, which Goldman says promotes teamwork, integrity and putting the client first, is at Goldman’s core. It helps the bank maintain and attract talent, and Goldman hopes it instills in its employees a type of focus that will allow it to thrive for decades to come. Corporate culture can make or break a firm. Mr. Smith’s book is interesting because while the tone for corporate culture is set at the top, managers like the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, rely on people like Mr. Smith to believe it and live by it. While the book is at its heart a story about how the firm’s culture broke down, it is oddly also a testament to some of the ways in which Goldman’s culture still works. For instance, Goldman is legendary for instilling the idea in traders that it is better to fess up to your mistakes, and the penalty for covering something up will be worse than if you had not spoken up. This lesson was drilled into Mr. Smith on his few months on the job, in the summer of 2000, when he was an intern and witnessed it in action throughout his career. The mantra of one of his first bosses, he says, was “no ambiguity, no error.” One morning he made a mistake on a trade, and came clean as the firm would hope he would. “We covered the error, traded out of it, and the correct trade was put on. In all that time – it seemed like 10 minutes but was probably 1 – the market had moved only one tick.” Mr. Smith noted that the error cost Goldman just 80, but the larger point he was making was reporting his error was the right thing, and encouraged by his managers. Another positive revelation: “Drugs were severely frowned upon at Goldman, even regarded with a certain horror.” And while Mr. Smith’s depiction of a bachelor party for a Goldman trader, replete with a topless woman in a hot tub, will not go down as Goldman’s finest moment, there was no obvious abuse of corporate funds at that party, or at anytime during his time there, at least that he cared to mention. He even goes out of his way to note that he once saw a partner who ordered a 400 bottle of wine and then paid for it himself because it exceeded the firm’s corporate spending guidelines. At the heart of Mr. Smith’s book, though, is what went wrong with Goldman’s culture. The firm’s overriding business principle is its clients’ interests always come first. He says traders in London frequently refer to clients as “muppets” and that their goal is to land elephant trades, transactions that will net the firm more than 1 million in revenue. Goldman, he said, “really had become more like a hedge fund, concerned more with helping itself than helping its clients with doing only the business we thought could make us a lot of money and ensure our survival,” he wrote. “Company culture and morale seemed to be bygone values.” Goldman could not disagree more. “Nothing that Greg suggested rang true to me,” said the head of human capital management, Edith W. Cooper, last week in an interview with Bloomberg TV. For years, the essential read for any new Goldman recruit has been a 1999 book, “The Culture of Success” by Lisa Endlich, a positive look at what sets Goldman apart from its rivals. Mr. Smith’s book will no doubt be added to the reading list of at least some students thinking about applying to Goldman. In the last few weeks, Goldman has adopted an uncharacteristically public attack plan, which has included media briefings and on the record interviews. Its effectiveness is critical because it will color the view of future recruits who pick up the book, and whether they believe (or even care) about his concerns. “I don’t see what he suggests are challenges at the firm,” Ms. Cooper said, “and I believe our culture is stronger than it’s ever been.” ||||| NEW YORK | NEW YORK (Reuters) - The tell-all book that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) former equity derivatives salesman Greg Smith has delivered may end up being remembered more for the marketing skills he picked up at the Wall Street bank than for any bombshell revelations. Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from the blue chip Wall Street firm, alleging in a New York Times Op-Ed column that the firm had engendered a \\"toxic\\" culture of treating clients as \\"muppets\\" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money. Smith then promised a book about the bank, building up expectations of an exposé with new insights about the culture at Goldman. The threat prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years. Smith reportedly received 1.5 million as an upfront payment for the book, which is being published by Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette. He has lined up a series of interviews, including one with Reuters, to talk about the book \\"Why I left Goldman Sachs\\", which will be released on Monday. Early reviews of Smith's 288-page book are now in, and they aren't good. Reviewers, who received copies of the full book, have panned it for being a sleepy read with no big revelations -- or worse, misleading. The tawdriest revelations are about a bachelor party in Las Vegas with a topless woman, and Smith having seen Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in the buff after showering at the gym. \\"There were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off,\\" wrote James Stewart, himself the author of top selling business books such as Den of Thieves, in his column in the New York Times. \\"Mr. Smith's book might even bolster Goldman's reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn't made much of a case,\\" said Stewart. Stewart also cast doubt on some of the anecdotes Smith tells in his story, interviewing people who were in his internship class, such as Teddy Schwarzman, son of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) CEO Stephen Schwarzman. Schwarzman and others say the incidents Smith described, such as an intern running out of a room crying after being humiliated by a more senior Goldman executive, never happened. Other early reviews have also been critical. The financial blog Dealbreaker mocked less-than-revelatory anecdotes in Smith's book, including one in which a managing director threw out a \\"cheddar cheese salad\\" that an intern had brought him for lunch, instead of the cheese sandwich he had asked for. That anecdote led to more jokes on Twitter and other financial blogs about what, exactly, a cheddar cheese salad is. Smith's publicist, Jimmy Franco, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Smith's ability to so easily build up buzz about his book over the past few months shows how difficult it has been for Goldman to try to counter perceptions that it is the poster child for all that's wrong on Wall Street. In 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of betting against clients on a mortgage trade, charges that were later settled, but nevertheless led to a firestorm of criticism. One of its former traders, Fabrice Tourre, is due in court next summer to face civil charges for his involvement in those events. Smith's allegations had raised the same questions about Goldman's culture and ethics all over again. For its part, Goldman has characterized Smith as a disgruntled and mediocre employee who stirred up all this attention because he did not get the raise and promotion he wanted. Smith spent 12 years at the investment bank. By the time of his resignation, he was a vice president, earning about 500,000 a year, Goldman said. Goldman has said that it looked into Smith's assertions and did not find any evidence of employees misbehaving or treating clients poorly. Blankfein told CNBC recently that the firm \\"went over everything like crazy and, frankly, we could find nothing.\\" The marketing strategy for the book shines a spotlight on tactics used by publishers and authors to drum up sales for upcoming publications - and the problems that it can create when the book in question fails to deliver. It appears to be \\"a typical example of overpromising and under-delivering,\\" said George Belch, chair of the marketing department at San Diego State University and an expert on consumer behavior, who noted that he has not yet read the book. \\"What they do is try to drum up publicity and whet the public appetite, and clearly Goldman Sachs, for certain portions of the population, is intriguing. But that doesn't mean the book will do anything more than reinforce your disdain for the industry if you already feel that way.\\" Smith's failure to meet expectations also raises uncomfortable questions for the Times, which first published his allegations in an op-ed column. On Friday morning, New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin said on CNBC he thought the newspaper might have been \\"duped\\" by Smith into publishing the op-ed in the first place, given the lack of substantial information in the book. A Times spokeswoman declined to comment. TRADER MENTALITY Smith, who vanished from the public spotlight after his Times op-ed appeared in March, will make his first television appearance on Sunday evening, on the CBS show \\"60 Minutes.\\" A clip of the show released on Friday has him recounting an incident in which he says a 24- or 25-year-old junior salesman calls a client a \\"muppet\\" after charging the client an additional 1 million for a trade. \\"Now you could think to yourself, 'Is this some rogue guy who's just talking callously about clients?'\\" Smith told CBS. \\"But his boss, who's a managing director, was sitting right next to him nodding and chuckling along.\\" In the interview, Smith wears a dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie, talking for the first time to the public in his native South African accent. Smith told CBS he does not think he betrayed Goldman and that he has gone on this public campaign to try to affect change at a firm he was once proud of. Belch, the marketing professor, said that by publicly slamming the firm, Smith might have done more harm than good, since the book appears to have little new information. \\"Here's another book about how we got taken to the cleaners by the financial services industry,\\" said Belch. \\"Well, yeah, what a shock. Most people don't want to spend money to read about it.\\" (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and Marguerita Choy) ||||| In this Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2012, photo, Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs banker, responds to questions during a news interview in New York.

He announced his departure from the investment bank with a blistering editorial in The New York Times, accusing Goldman of routinely deceiving clients and relentlessly pursuing profit at the expense of morality. And he struck a nerve. The essay went viral in the financial world and beyond. Smith was praised for uncloaking corruption that was crying out to be addressed, and also derided as a disgruntled employee. Goldman Sachs denies Smith's allegations about deceiving clients. The bank says it took his concerns seriously, thoroughly investigated them, and found no evidence to support them. Smith's book, \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" is being released Monday. It's a window into a company that is notoriously tight-lipped, with stories about a swaggering place where interns arise for 5 a.m. meetings and business trips mean slapping down 150 for one person's dinner. What Smith hopes to do, he says, is educate people about how Wall Street works, and fuel a public conversation about what went wrong ethically, and how to fix it. The practices that caused the financial crisis, he says, were never really resolved; they're just lying dormant. Smith, 33, gave his first print interview to The Associated Press. Excerpts have been edited for clarity and length. Q: Tell us about March 14, the day you left Goldman. You were working in the London office, and you say you had already cleaned out your desk and had been told the editorial would go online at 7 a.m. your time. A: I get up at 6 a.m., and I type a very heartfelt email to nine people in Europe, including the CEO of Goldman Europe, and express in very personal terms why I'm leaving. I talk about exactly what I thought was wrong with the place, this obvious deceit of clients. Within five minutes I get an email back from someone on the management committee in Europe who says, \\"I'm really surprised to hear this. I'm in London today. I'd love to meet with you.\\" I get two voice mails from two other people. And then at 6:57 or 6:58, the piece comes online. Q: What did the bank do? A: My work BlackBerry stayed on for about three more hours, and I started getting emails from clients who were saying, \\"We completely agree with you, we don't trust Goldman Sachs, we do business with you guys with a \`buyer beware' attitude.\\" I started getting text messages from Goldman managing directors who were supportive as well. And Goldman reached out to me in formal fashion and said, \\"We're sorry to hear you resigned; we'd like to air these concerns out.\\" Q: The bank denies everything you've charged about them ripping off clients. A: The thing that disappoints me most is that management is denying there's a problem. Why not try to repair the trust instead? Clients are telling you they don't trust you. There's been an SEC fraud suit that was settled for half a billion dollars. (The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of selling investments to clients when the bank believed the investments were going to fail. Goldman paid 550 million. It remains the largest SEC penalty paid by a Wall Street firm.) I'm not some lone voice who thought there was a problem, a change from a client fiduciary model (doing what's best for the client) to use-the-client-to-extract-wealth model. It's a problem that many, many of my colleagues felt and that the public feels as well, borne out in SEC suits and congressional testimonies and clients saying publicly that they don't trust us. Q: Were you just disgruntled? Maybe you didn't get the bonus or the promotion you wanted? A: I was actually doing well in my career at Goldman. My bonus, I was told I outperformed my peers by 10 percent. I'm a competitive person, and my goal was to get promoted, and I was told by multiple partners that I was two years away from getting promoted. So it certainly was a goal of mine. And on the compensation side, I was earning a lot of money and had a very good living, so I was grateful for what I was earning. It allowed me to have a good life and to support my family and to do things that I thought were valuable. Q: But you were at Goldman for almost 12 years, if you start with your summer internship in 2000. Weren't there times when you should have stood up, should have said something about what you thought was morally wrong? A: I actually made a conscious decision not to sell toxic deals to clients. I didn't think it was the right thing to do, but I also saw the idea that if clients' trust is being burned and they're getting blown up, you're not going to have a career for very long. Now that does not mean I was not part of a system that was doing things that were unethical. In the book, I try to show some of the conflicts I noticed that gave me pause. For many years, I gave the firm the benefit of the doubt. It absolutely could have happened quicker. But one can always see things earlier and sooner. Q: OK, but isn't the purpose of any capitalist company to make money? You certainly made a lot of money at Goldman. (Smith says he made in the \\"high hundreds of thousands of dollars\\" in his best years but declines to be more specific. His publisher declines to say what he was paid for the book.) A: Capitalism should be where everyone competes hard and makes money, in an environment where there is fair play and competitiveness. Right now the system is stacked against everyone else in favor of the banks. It's a little like a casino. A real casino is regulated and there are cameras everywhere and the casino cannot see your cards. With Wall Street today, the bank can see what every government, every pension fund, every hedge fund in the world is doing. They can effectively see everyone's cards. Then, instead of facilitating the client's will, they're trying to get the client to facilitate their will. Q: What do you hope to accomplish with your book? A: People know there's this huge conflict, and that things are being done that are unethical but are not necessarily illegal. But nobody can put their finger on exactly what the problem is. My goal with the book was to write it to a general reader who knows nothing about finance. By the time someone reaches the end of the book, they can say, \\"I can now speak more intelligently about where the conflicts of interest are, and I can lobby my congressman or I can speak about it more.\\" If people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless. That was the problem with Occupy Wall Street _ they didn't know what they were protesting. Q: The banks are going to say any bad practices were caused by just a few bad actors, and that those guys are gone. A: This is not some conspiracy of five people sitting in a room plotting to destroy the world. This is far more boring. This is where people have created a perverse incentive system. If someone can overcharge a client by a million dollars, their leaders are going to say, \\"Great job, we just made an extra million dollars off this pension fund.\\" Q: So the endemic part is that people don't speak up? A: People don't like being asked or compelled to make morally dubious decisions. But unfortunately a lot of people's livelihoods are tied up in this, and it's not an easy thing to unwind. Their lives are caught up in this system where they're sending their kids to private schools _ it's almost like the machine for them is working so well that there's no way to undo it unless you want to change your lifestyle. Q: Why should we care about what happens on Wall Street? A: You see a lot of commentary that Wall Street is just rich people gambling with other rich people's money. I want people to know that it ultimately affects everyone. In 2008, banks had to be bailed out and that hits taxpayers. If you're a teacher or a fireman or a charity, and you have an investment fund that is trading with Wall Street, and Wall Street is not being held accountable and behaving ethically, then that directly impacts everyone. Q: What about the reaction of your family and friends to all this? You didn't tell them about the editorial beforehand. A: No, my mother would have been really upset, and frankly my mother is still very upset. She's mostly worried about how I don't have a job right now. For my parents' generation, the idea of stability is very important, while my generation is a little more idealistic about wanting to actually change things, even if it involves some kind of personal risk. It took me a while to show my mother that I was actually very proud of this. ||||| Greg Smith, who blasted Goldman Sachs when he publicly resigned from the firm and is releasing a book about his experience there, is telling a story that increasingly doesn’t make any sense. In his first television interview since submitting his resignation letter to the opinion pages of The New York Times in March, Smith continued to say things that were inconsistent with some of his biggest allegations against Goldman Sachs. One example from his 60 Minutes interveiw: Smith said that a big shot at a key Goldman Sachs client, some huge fund in Asia, told him that he didn’t trust Goldman Sachs, but that he would continue to do business with the firm. The anonymous fund man, Smith says, made this statement after Goldman Sachs was accused by the Securities & Exchange Commission of profiting by misleading clients in a single deal in 2010 and Goldman Sachs execs were grilled in a congressional hearing. Smith said he was troubled by this story, but he shouldn’t have been. It’s precisely what should be happening in financial markets, especially among large and sophisticated financial institutions. No one charged with making large financial decisions on behalf of themselves or others should just trust any big Wall Street firm, not just Goldman Sachs, but also Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and on and on—and if they do blindly put faith in those institutions trying to sell them stuff then the bigger problem is that such individuals have been given the authority to buy products from Goldman Sachs in the first place. Smith was not selling sophisticated financial products to retail investors, he was selling them to large and sophisticated institutions. That doesn’t mean that it’s not sleazy, wrong and in some cases potentially illegal for Wall Street banks to mislead their clients, but it does undermine Smith’s argument about Goldman Sachs doing business with muppet clients. Smith wrote that at Goldman “callously people talk about ripping their clients off” and refer to those clients as muppets. But now Smith is saying that at least one muppet, after the financial crisis, wised up and openly declared entering into transactions with the care that is required. So what’s the problem now? Smith, by the way, remained happily employed at Goldman making as much as 500,000 in the years prior to the financial crisis—which I think we can all agree was a low point for ethical behavior on Wall Street and at Goldman—but not the low point in tell-all Wall Street book sell-outs. James Stewart, who has helped set the standard for writing books about Wall Street scandal, read Smith’s book and found it “fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions.” Stewart also alleges that Smith may have invented a billionaire intern he cites in a Goldman Sachs anecdote. Last week, Goldman Sachs released a summary of its investigation into Smith’s claims that said Smith was denied a big raise and promotion shortly before quitting. Anderson Cooper asked Smith about this charge on 60 Minutes. Smith did not deny it and said he would have quit anyway. |||||","completion":"Greg Smith resigned from Goldman Sachs and accused the company of having a \\"toxic and destructive\\" culture, claiming that the firm promotes \\"morally bankrupt people\\" and that the bankers were ripping off their clients. In his book \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" he states that he has not provided any concrete examples because he has changed \\"names or descriptors\\" for people and acknowledges that what he discloses is \\"from memory,\\" which makes it almost impossible to verify what he says.

When not in use, store your silver with desiccating packets filled with silica gel. These can usually be purchased at craft stores, general retailers, and hardware stores. If you have small children or pets, be sure these packets are inaccessible to them. Eating these packets could be deadly. Alternatively, store a piece of chalk with your silver. Similar to the desiccating packets, the chalk will absorb moisture. Chalk will also be less dangerous to children and pets. Anything that contains lemon juice or vinegar will likely cause your silver to tarnish very quickly. Forego using your silver when serving any acidic food. Mustard, onions, and eggs are some of the most common foods that contribute to rapid oxidation. Food that has a sour taste often has acidic properties. When in doubt, use non-silver items with food like this. In some cases, perspiration may be acidic enough to cause oxidation. Other possible culprits include perfume, makeup, hair products, and cleaning products. Rubber and latex will have a strong negative reaction to silver. They can permanently deface its finish or cause the metal to be eaten away. Avoid storing your silver with other metals. Doing so can also make the silver oxidize more quickly. The detergent and heat of your dishwasher can cause oxidation and corrosion in your silver. Silver should be cleaned with cool water and a mild soap. Use a soft cotton cloth to wipe dirty silver clean when necessary.

Researchers have discovered a protein that they claim is the missing link to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that blocking this protein with an existing drug can restore memory in mice with brain damage that mimics the disease. The findings could offer hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. Alzheimer's causes a decrease in the size of the brain, shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities (white, at centre of brain) and the widened pale blue regions. Researchers now believe they have found the 'missing link' that triggers the disease. 'What is very exciting is that of all the links in this molecular chain, this is the protein that may be most easily targeted by drugs,' said the study’s senior author Stephen Strittmatter at Yale School of Medicine. The study offers hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. 'This gives us strong hope that we can find a drug that will work to lessen the burden of Alzheimer’s.' During Alzheimer's disease protein 'plaques' develop in the structure of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. People with Alzheimer's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain involved with the transmission of messages within the brain. Scientists have already provided a partial molecular map of how Alzheimer’s disease destroys brain cells. In earlier work, Professor Strittmatter’s lab showed that the amyloid-beta peptides, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, couple with prion proteins. By an unknown process, the coupling activates a molecular messenger called Fyn. The new findings, published in the journal Neuron, reveals the missing link in the chain, a protein within the cell membrane called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, or mGluR5. When the protein is blocked by a drug similar to one being developed for Fragile X syndrome, the deficits in memory, learning, and synapse density were restored in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s. Prof Strittmatter stressed that new drugs may have to be designed to precisely target the amyloid-prion disruption of mGluR5 in human cases of Alzheimer’s and said his lab is exploring new ways to achieve this. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, currently affecting around 496,000 people in the UK.

He was born on December 15, 1983, in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2004, Radke formed the band Escape the Fate along with several friends. The band soon gained success with their debut album, \\"Dying Is Your Latest Fashion,\\" released in 2006. Radke's time with Escape the Fate, however, was marked by personal struggles and controversies. In May 2006, Radke was involved in a fight that resulted in the shooting death of teenager Michael Cook. Radke was charged with battery and subsequently found guilty of the lesser charge, serving two years of probation. However, his probation was violated after he failed to report to his probation officer, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in 2008. Due to these legal issues and drug addiction problems, Radke was removed from Escape the Fate. While in prison, Radke formed a new band called Falling in Reverse. After being released from prison in late 2010, Radke began focusing on his music career with Falling in Reverse. The band released its debut album, \\"The Drug in Me Is You,\\" in 2011, which garnered commercial success and positive reviews. Falling in Reverse has since released several more albums, including \\"Fashionably Late,\\" \\"Just Like You,\\" and \\"Coming Home.\\" Throughout his career, Ronnie Radke has faced various controversies, including substance abuse, legal issues, and conflicts with other musicians.

My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.

Dave Holland (born 1 October 1946) is an English jazz double bassist, composer and bandleader who has been performing and recording for five decades. He has lived in the United States for over 40 years. His work ranges from pieces for solo performance to big band. Holland runs his own independent record label, Dare2, which he launched in 2005. During the 1990s, Holland renewed an affiliation, begun in the 1970s, with Joe Henderson, joining the tenor saxophonist on So Near (So Far), a tribute to Miles Davis, and Porgy & Bess. Holland also reunited with vocalist Betty Carter, touring and recording the live album Feed the Fire (1993). Fellow Davis alumnus Herbie Hancock invited Holland to tour with him in 1992, subsequently recording The New Standard. Holland joined Hancock's band again in 1996. He was also part of the sessions for River: The Joni Letters, winner of the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. As a leader, Holland formed his third quartet and released Dream of the Elders (1995), which introduced the vibraphonist Steve Nelson to his ensembles. Holland formed a quintet that includes tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, trombonist Robin Eubanks and, a more recent addition, drummer Nate Smith. Their recordings include Points of View, Prime Directive, Not for Nothin, Extended Play: Live at Birdland and Critical Mass. In addition to releasing four quintet albums on ECM, Holland debuted his Big Band, which released What Goes Around in 2002. The album won Holland his first Grammy as a leader, in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category. The second Big Band recording, Overtime (2005), again won the Grammy in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category; it was released on Holland's Dare2 label, which he formed that year. In 2009, Holland was a co-founder of an all-star group called the Overtone Quartet. The group consisted of Holland on bass, Chris Potter on tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Eric Harland on drums. The group toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe.

If \\"A man with brown hair talks on a microphone.\\", does it logically follow that \\"man talks on microphone\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"a man talks on a microphone\\" when given the statement \\"a man with brown hair talks on a microphone.\\" Let us break down the statement and analyze the logical components. The original statement contains three key pieces of information: 1. \\"A man\\" - This identifies the subject of the statement. It informs us that we are talking about a male human being, without specifying any further details about who he is. 2. \\"With brown hair\\" - This adds a descriptive element to the subject. It tells us that the man has brown hair. Although this additional information helps develop a visual image, it is not required to understand that a man is talking on a microphone. 3. \\"Talks on a microphone\\" - This specifies the action being performed by the subject. It tells us that the man is engaged in speaking into a microphone. From these components, we can derive the simplified statement, \\"a man talks on a microphone.\\" This statement removes unnecessary descriptive details (brown hair) while preserving the core message, which conveys that a man is talking on a microphone. The logical reasoning behind this simplification follows deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a type of logic that aims to build arguments based on premises that, if true, guarantee that the conclusion is also true. In this case, we have the statement, \\"A man with brown hair talks on a microphone,\\" which can be broken down into two premises: Premise 1: A man with brown hair is still a man. Premise 2: Talking on a microphone is the action being performed by the man. The conclusion, \\"a man talks on a microphone,\\" is logically derived from these premises. Since the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A: be mad at others B: have a good time C: avoid others The answer is:","completion":"B: have a good time According to the context provided, Kai has put effort into getting Addison's friends together for a surprise party with a group of people from school.

Therefore, option B: \\"have a good time\\" is the most suitable answer according to the context given. The other options do not align with the context provided: Option A: \\"be mad at others\\" would not make sense as the context does not provide any reason for Kai to be mad at others. On the contrary, Kai has made an effort to gather people together for a surprise party, indicating a motivation for ensuring everyone's enjoyment.

Help as much as you can. Question: How did the pendulum improve upon earlier clocks?? Would \\"An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The pendulum improved upon earlier clocks by providing a more accurate and consistent timekeeping mechanism. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, time was measured using devices like water clocks, hourglasses, and verge-and-foliot mechanisms, which were less accurate and susceptible to errors due to external factors like temperature and humidity. A pendulum clock uses the regular swinging motion of the pendulum as its timekeeping element, and the period of this motion remains constant regardless of the amplitude, making it a more precise measuring tool. As for your proposed answer, \\"An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors\\" may not be a direct answer to the question of how the pendulum improved upon earlier clocks. This statement focuses on a visual representation of the pendulum's motion in terms of velocity and acceleration. While it could contribute to understanding the working principle behind the pendulum's accuracy, it does not explicitly describe how this principle led to the improvement of clocks. A more suitable response might be something like, \\"A pendulum improved upon earlier clocks by offering consistent and accurate timekeeping through its regular swinging motion, which remains constant regardless of amplitude.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Problem:Premise: A child in a jester costume standing in front of a television set. Hypothesis: A child dressed as a jester is watching his favorite tv show. Update: The television set is broken. Solution:","completion":"The task is asking you to determine whether the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, based on the premise given. 1. Understand the premise: A child in a jester costume standing in front of a television set. (This is considered true.) 2.

Read the update: The television set is broken. (This is additional information about the situation that might affect the hypothesis.) To find the answer, think about how the update influences the likelihood of the hypothesis being true: - Does the update make the hypothesis more likely to be true? If yes, the answer is 'strengthener.' - Does the update make the hypothesis less likely to be true? If yes, the answer is 'weakener.' In this case, the update indicates that the television set is broken, which means it is less likely that the child is watching his favorite tv show.

Review: 's really unclear Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"Based on the given sentence \\"'s really unclear,\\" it is difficult to determine if this movie review is primarily positive or negative. The statement appears to express confusion or ambiguity about the movie. While it is not explicitly negative, it does not shed a positive light on the movie either. If we were to interpret the sentence, we could infer a sense of uncertainty or lack of clarity about the plot, acting, direction, or themes within the movie. This could be an indication that the movie is complex, requiring more in-depth analysis, or perhaps poorly executed, leaving audiences baffled by the narrative and overall direction. On the other hand, it is also possible that the reviewer is expressing their personal confusion or struggle to understand the movie, rather than criticizing the movie itself. In this case, the review might not necessarily reflect the movie's merits or demerits. Instead, it could be more of a reflection of the reviewer's subjective experience and understanding. In conclusion, the given sentence \\"'s really unclear\\" is neither directly positive nor negative, but it does suggest confusion or ambiguity. To better understand the reviewer's overall perspective, additional context and commentary on specific aspects of the movie would be necessary. It is always beneficial to consider multiple reviews and opinions to get a comprehensive understanding of any film."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - The nave is the central aisle of a basilica church, or the main body of a church (whether aisled or not) between its western wall and its chancel. It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach. - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop . - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes.

Objective: To make nutella runny and easier to work with, you can Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Given that the objective is to make Nutella runny and easier to work with, we can analyze the different solutions in terms of their naive physics reasoning to determine which solution is more sound. Naive physics reasoning refers to the basic understanding and reasoning about the physical world that comes naturally to humans without any formal physics education. Solution 1: Heating Nutella One way to make Nutella runny is by heating it. When you heat Nutella, the temperature increases, and this causes the viscosity of the Nutella to decrease. The decrease in viscosity makes the Nutella flow more easily and become runnier. This is aligned with our naive understanding of the effect of heat on substances: when you heat a substance, especially fats or chocolate-based substances, they generally become less solid and more liquid-like. Therefore, using heat to make Nutella runny is a sound solution according to naive physics reasoning. Solution 2: Adding oil to Nutella Another possible solution is to add a small amount of oil, such as vegetable oil, to Nutella. When oil is mixed with Nutella, it changes the texture and consistency of the Nutella, making it smoother and more liquid. According to naive physics reasoning, mixing oil with other substances, especially those that are fat-based like Nutella, can help thin the mixture and make it easier to spread or work with. This can be observed in simple home cooking scenarios, where we often combine oil with other ingredients to create a smoother consistency. Thus, adding oil to Nutella can also be considered a sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. Conclusion: Both solutions, heating Nutella and adding oil to Nutella, are sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. They each address the problem of making Nutella runny and easier to work with, based on our common understanding of the physical world. However, it is important to note that the choice of the solution depends on the specific needs and context. For example, if you're looking to maintain Nutella's original flavor, heating it up might be the best option, as adding oil could potentially dilute its taste. On the other hand, if external conditions or equipment make it difficult to heat the Nutella effectively, adding oil could be a quicker and more practical solution. From the perspective of naive physics reasoning alone, both options are viable to achieve the objective of making Nutella runnier and easier to work with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Francisco Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Caceres, Spain (then in the Crown of Castile) in modern-day Extremadura, Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446-1522) and Francisca Gonzalez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1474. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate. On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Uraba. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523. Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions. Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530. When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima. The conquistador of Peru was laid to rest in the Lima Cathedral. How long did he stay there?","completion":"The article does not provide a specific length for Francisco Pizarro's stay in the New World or in particular regions. However, we can deduce some information about the time he spent in certain areas. Pizarro began his journey to the New World in 1509 and remained there until his assassination in Lima in 1541. This means he was in the New World for approximately 32 years. Some notable milestones mentioned in the article include him serving as mayor and magistrate in Panama City from 1519 to 1523 and then founding the city of Lima in January 1535. Pizarro was assassinated in Lima on June 26, 1541, so he spent approximately 6.5 years there after its foundation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. The ancient peoples now called \\"Celts\\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tene culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples. The extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial. Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. The term \\"Celt\\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Keltoi, Celtae). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic--and Goidelic--speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland. Then in the 18th century the interest in \\"primitivism\\", which led to the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \\"Irish revival\\" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \\"Celtic Revival\\". Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Artistic continuity: The fact that a case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age or even the Neolithic age shows that Celtic art has deep historical roots. 2. Celtic art in different periods: The distinction between early Celtic art (while the term \\"Celtic art\\" generally refers to the European Iron Age) and the La Tene period implies that the art form evolved over time. 3. Shared linguistic origin: The origin of Celts as a group of people who spoke a common language (Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic) highlights the importance of language in shaping cultural identity and artistic expression. 4. Debate over common genetic origin: The ongoing debate among scholars regarding the genetic origin of Celtic groups points at the complexity and diversity of Celtic cultures in Europe. 5. Connection between culture and genetics: The uncertainty surrounding the extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture, and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods raises interesting questions about the formation of cultural identity in general. 6. The \\"Celtic Revival\\": The shift in attitude towards Celtic and Druidic art forms during the 18th and 19th century demonstrates the impact of historical and political events on the way we appreciate and rediscover cultural heritage. Overall, this article provides an insightful overview of Celtic art and raises thought-provoking questions about the links between language, culture, genetics, and artistic expression."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

A prominent fascist , Mandl was attached to the Austrofascism and Italian varieties and an opponent of Nazism . In the 1930s he became close to Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg , the commander of the Austrian nationalist militia ( \`\` Heimwehr '' ) , which he furnished with weapons and ammunition . From 1933 to 1937 , Mandl was married to Austrian actress Hedwig \`\` Hedy '' Kiesler , who would later become known as Hedy Lamarr in Hollywood . Both Hedy Lamarr 's parents were born Jewish , but her mother converted to Roman Catholicism and was a practicing Catholic . Hedy was brought up Catholic . It is understandable , considering the times that she lived in , that she kept her ethnicity a secret . The couple were rumored to have very intimate contacts with the very highest levels of the people controlling Germany . In her autobiography she indicates that she attended a convent school for girls . When she went to Hollywood her connections with very wealthy people were obviously helpful to her career . Her first \`\` serious '' film was Algiers for which she was highly acclaimed at the time . Mandl is rumoured to have attempted to bring a halt to her acting career in Germany and to purchase all copies of her infamous film Ecstasy ( 1933 ) , in which she appeared nude . Following incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany with the Anschluss of 1938 , Mandl 's remaining property which had not yet been transferred to Swiss ownership was seized , since he had supported the separatist Austrofascism and his father was Jewish . Despite Mandl 's part Jewish heritage , his then - wife Lamarr wrote in her autobiography Ecstasy and Me , that both Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German dictator Adolf Hitler attended Mandl 's parties . Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling , and wrote that she escaped only by disguising herself as a... - Freikorps (\\"Free Corps\\") were German volunteer units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the members of which effectively fought as mercenaries, regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries the first so-called \\"Freikorps\\" \\"free regiments\\" were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters, and criminals. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry or, more rarely, as artillery. Sometimes in just company strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong, there were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian \\"von Kleist Freikorps\\" included infantry, jäger, dragoons and hussars. The French Volontaires de Saxe combined uhlans and dragoons. - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892 July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938. - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich. - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement. - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Hirtenberg is a town of approx. 2,500 inhabitants near Baden bei Wien in Lower Austria, Austria. The river Triesting is located at the south border of the town. Coming from the Vienna Woods, the valley of Triesting joins the Vienna Basin here. - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\".

But trends have waxed and waned, with differing success for these two industry giants, while other companies, such as Huawei, LG, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo, have individually captured smaller, yet not insignificant, slices of the market. Samsung commanded the highest shipment market share worldwide in 2011, a position it consistently held over the next few years. In 2012, its market share stood at 30.3%, rising slightly to 31.3% in 2013. There was a slight drop to a 31% share in Q1 2014, but by Q2 2016 it fell to 22.3%. Despite these fluctuations, Samsung remained a market leader, and in Q1 2017, it led the pack with 80 million units shipped. On the other hand, Apple saw both growth and decline during this period. Having a 15.3% market share in 2013, it lost ground from its 18.7% share in 2012. Despite this, its shipment volume still increased by 12.9%, demonstrating the iPhone's continuing popularity. In Q1 2014, Apple held a share of 16%, but by Q4 2014, its piece of the pie grew to 20.4%, outperforming Samsung's 19.9% share for that quarter.

[B]. dangerous bugs. [C]. protein. [D]. fat.","completion":"Illness is prevented in people by reducing [B]. dangerous bugs in food. Bacteria are a form of dangerous bugs that can contaminate food and cause illness in people. Reducing the presence of harmful bacteria in food is critical to ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals who consume it. Many foodborne illnesses are caused by the consumption of contaminated food, which may harbor pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins produced by these microorganisms. There are several methods to reduce dangerous bugs in food, including proper food handling, storage, and preparation techniques. Here are some key strategies for minimizing the risk of foodborne illness: 1. Maintain proper hygiene: Washing hands before handling food, using clean utensils and cutting boards, and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. 2. Cook food thoroughly: Cooking food at the appropriate temperatures can help eliminate harmful bacteria and other dangerous bugs. The recommended minimum internal temperature for various types of food include: - 165°F (74°C) for poultry and leftovers - 160°F (71°C) for ground meats and egg dishes - 145°F (63°C) for whole cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb - 145°F (63°C) for fish 3. Store food correctly: Proper food storage can also prevent the growth of dangerous bugs. Perishable food should be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours of being cooked or purchased. Keep the refrigerator temperature at 40°F (4°C) or below and the freezer temperature at 0°F (-18°C) or below. 4. Handle raw ingredients carefully: Avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw meats, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked foods. 5. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly: Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water before consuming, cutting, or cooking them to remove any surface bacteria or other contaminants. 6. Be cautious with high-risk foods: Foods such as raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, and raw shellfish can carry higher risks of bacterial contamination. Only consume these products if they have been properly handled and prepared. By following these food safety practices and reducing the presence of dangerous bugs in food, the risk of illness in people can be significantly minimized, promoting overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Lost Kafka writings resurface, trapped in trial JERUSALEM — It seems almost Kafkaesque: Ten safety deposit boxes of never-published writings by Franz Kafka, their exact contents unknown, are trapped in courts and bureaucracy, much like one of the nightmarish visions created by the author himself. The papers, retrieved from bank vaults where they have sat untouched and unread for decades, could shed new light on one of literature's darkest figures. In the past week, the pages have been pulled from safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich, Switzerland, on the order of an Israeli court over the objections of two elderly women who claim to have inherited them from their mother. \\"Kafka could easily have written a story like this, where you try to do something and it all goes wrong and everything remains unresolved,\\" said Sara Loeb, a Tel Aviv-based author of two books about the writer. \\"It's really a case of life imitating art.\\" Literary experts in both cities are sifting through the boxes, and the contents are expected to be of priceless literary and monetary value. What exactly is there remains unknown, but the papers include handwritten manuscripts, letters and various literary works by the famed Jewish writer, said Meir Heller, an attorney for the Israeli National Library, which also claims ownership of the trove. Loeb says the cache could include endings to some of Kafka's major works, many of which remained unfinished in his lifetime. \\"We could find out about his methods, his style, how his art was created, how he built a text,\\" she said. Kafka, a Prague native who wrote in German, was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his surreal tales of everyman protagonists crushed by mysterious authorities or twisted by unknown shames. His works have become classics, like \\"The Metamorphosis,\\" in which a salesman wakes up transformed into a giant insect, and \\"The Trial,\\" where a bank clerk is put through an excruciating trial without ever being told the charges against him. But the newly emerged writings won't see the light of day until the Israeli court unravels the tangled question of the collection's rightful owner. The case boils down to the interpretation of the will of Max Brod, Kafka's longtime friend and publisher. Kafka bequeathed his writings to Brod shortly before his own death from tuberculosis in 1924, instructing his friend to burn everything unread. Brod ignored Kafka's wishes and published most of what was in his possession, including the novels \\"The Trial,\\" \\"The Castle\\" and \\"Amerika.\\" But Brod, who smuggled some of the manuscripts to pre-state Israel when he fled the Nazis in 1938, didn't publish everything. Upon his death in 1968, Brod left his personal secretary, Esther Hoffe, in charge of his literary estate and instructed her to transfer the Kafka papers to an academic institution. Instead, for the next four decades, Hoffe kept the papers in her Tel Aviv apartment and in safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich banks. She sold some of the items for hefty sums. In 1988, for instance, Hoffe auctioned off the original manuscript of \\"The Trial\\" at Sotheby's in London. It went for 1.8 million to the German Literature Archive in Marbach, north of Stuttgart. When Hoffe died three years ago at age 101, she left the collection to her two daughters, Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both Holocaust survivors like herself. But the Israeli National Library has long claimed the papers, saying Brod intended for the collection to end up in its hands. It filed an injunction against the execution of Hoffe's will. \\"As long as Esther Hoffe was alive, she was responsible, she could still say, 'I am handling it,'\\" said Heller, the library's lawyer. \\"The late Mrs. Hoffe did not do what the late Mr. Brod asked her to do and deposit the documents in the national library. ... The will was not honored, it was desecrated.\\" Oded Hacohen, a lawyer for Eva Hoffe, said Brod's will gave the collection to her mother as a gift and gave her the right to bequeath it to the Israel National Museum or any institution of her choosing, in Israel or abroad, under whatever conditions she decides. He cited a 1974 Tel Aviv District Court ruling backing that interpretation and quoting Brod's will. That means, he said, Eva Hoffe inherited the documents legally and is free to do with them as she pleases, including selling them to the German Literature Archive, which has been negotiating with her to buy the remaining Kafka and Brod papers. \\"Esther Hoffe dedicated her life to publishing Brod's works. ... Brod wrote in his will that her family should enjoy the profits,\\" Hacohen said. Heller retorts that the will only refers to royalties, not ownership, and didn't give Esther Hoffe the right to hand the collection to her heirs. He argued in court that since she failed to pick an archive to receive the documents, the court should do so. Heller contended in court that the Israeli National Library was Brod's first preference, saying he had evidence Brod wrote a later will bequeathing his literary estate directly to it. The Tel Aviv Family Court ordered the collection opened a year ago, saying it wants to know what is there before deciding who owns it. That ruling won't come until experts are done inspecting the papers, which could take several weeks. \\"The library does not intend to give up the cultural assets that legally belong to it and thus to the Israeli and Jewish people,\\" said David Blumberg, chairman of the Israel National Library, which is a nonprofit and non-governmental body. Ulrich von Buelow, the director of manuscripts at the German Literary Archive, said Brod and Esther Hoffe had frequent discussions with the archive over placing the material there. \\"We are interested in having the manuscripts because we have so many others, also from Brod, and so many letters that would complement them,\\" von Buelow said. Whatever they contain, the piles of handwritten material will keep historians and researchers busy for years, Heller said. Aside from previously unknown versions of Kafka's work, the trove could give more insight on Kafka's personal life, including his relationship with his lover, Dora Diamant. It may include papers that Kafka gave to Diamant but were stolen by the German Gestapo from her Berlin apartment in 1933, later obtained by Brod after World War II. Loeb suspected that Brod kept many of the documents away from the public for fear their publication could compromise his friend's legacy. \\"Kafka was very critical. He was not an easy man,\\" she said. \\"Maybe Brod was worried that this could ruin his image.\\" Associated Press writers Melissa Eddy in Berlin and Bradley Klapper in Geneva contributed to this report. Copyright © 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. ||||| The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was involved in the legal challenge to lift the secrecy surrounding the privately-held archive, disclosed the existence of the short story on its website. The discovery emerged as an Israeli court rejected an application to keep secret the contents of a vast collection of Kafka's writings that has been buried in the vaults of three banks in Israel and Switzerland for over 40 years. The news will cause enormous excitement in the literary world. Although his longer novel The Trial gave the world the adjective Kafkaesque, it is his short stories that are perhaps best known to the reading public. His most memorable short story was probably The Metamorphosis, whose unfortunate hero, Gregor Samsa, wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into \\"a monstrous insect\\". The ruling came after a group of lawyers and scholars, acting on the instructions of Israel's supreme court, began opening some of the 10 safety deposit boxes containing the collection last week. There had been fears that the archive, which is also believed to contain letters, diaries and drawings, would remain hidden from wider view after two sisters who claim ownership of the collection filed an injunction to keep its contents secret. Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both in their seventies, have been at the centre of a legal wrangle over the Kafka papers since they inherited the collection two years ago from their mother Ester, who was the secretary of Kafka's great friend, Max Brod. Ester Hoffe kept the contents of the papers secret since she came into possession of them in 1968. Talia Pardo, a judge in the Tel Aviv district court, rejected the secrecy application made by the two sisters and ordered them to pay costs. The court is now expected to rule on the legitimacy of their inheritance. Israel's state-owned national library has insisted that it should be granted custodianship of the papers on the grounds that they represent an important piece of Jewish heritage. Kafka died of tuberculosis in 1924. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: Ten safety deposit boxes containing unpublished writings by Franz Kafka have resurfaced, having been untouched and unread for decades. The exact contents of these boxes are unknown, but experts believe they may contain valuable literary works and provide new insights into one of literature's most enigmatic figures. The documents were retrieved from bank vaults in Tel Aviv and Zurich, Switzerland, on the order of an Israeli court, over the objections of two elderly women who claim to have inherited the writings from their mother. The contents of these boxes could include handwritten manuscripts, letters, and other literary works by Kafka. However, the documents will not be released to the public until the Israeli court resolves the ownership dispute involving the Israeli National Library and the two sisters who claim to have inherited the collection. The outcome of this case could potentially reveal unknown works by Kafka, give insight into his personal life, and unlock new interpretations of his writing style and methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Officials said they had lied when they applied for tourist visas and would not be allowed to work in Guatemala. The Dutch group, Women on Waves, offers free abortion services to women in countries where the procedure is banned. It takes women in the early stages of pregnancy out to international waters, where the abortion is performed. Abortion is only allowed in Guatemala when the mother's life is at risk. A spokeswoman for Women on Waves confirmed that they had been told to leave the country immediately, but she said its lawyers had appealed against the decision. La Prensa Libre newspaper said the four crew members being expelled were US citizens. It is not clear if other members of the group have also been ordered to leave the country. The Army said on Thursday it had been instructed by President Jimmy Morales to act, and would defend \\"human life and the laws of our country\\" by preventing the group from carrying out abortions. The Women on Waves' boat docked on the Pacific Ocean port of Quetzal, in the city of San Jose, on Wednesday. The group says it had a legal permit to sail in Guatemalan waters and the boat was being illegally \\"detained\\" by the authorities. The group says more than 60,000 illegal abortions are performed in Guatemala every year, and most of the women who put their lives at risk at the hands of untrained professionals are poor. \\"We respect religious beliefs but this [abortion] is a fundamental right in a democracy,\\" spokeswoman Leticia Zevich told La Hora Newspaper. However, Guatemala's Catholic Church, other religious leaders and politicians protested against the presence of the boat. In most Latin American countries, abortion is either illegal or only allowed to save the life of the woman.

Bruno Latour (French: [latuR]; born 22 June 1947) is a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist. He is especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS). After teaching at the Ecole des Mines de Paris (Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at Sciences Po Paris (2006-2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book, the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naive descriptions of the scientific method, in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice. In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy. Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard, they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are socially constructed within the laboratory--that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices-- in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: \\"Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.\\" Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly, philosopher John Searle argues that Latour's \\"extreme social constructivist\\" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently \\"comical results.\\"","completion":"This text is about Bruno Latour, a French philosopher, anthropologist, and sociologist known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\".

Write a title for this article: NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- U.S. Rep. William Jefferson easily defeated his fellow Democratic opponent in a runoff election Saturday, despite an ongoing federal bribery investigation. In complete but unofficial returns, Jefferson, Louisiana's first black congressman since Reconstruction, received 57 percent of the vote over state Rep. Karen Carter, who had 43 percent. Carter was unable to capitalize on a scandal that included allegations the FBI found 90,000 in bribe money in Jefferson's freezer. In a concession speech, Carter embraced family members and pledged to work with Jefferson, especially on the area's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. \\"I guess the people are happy with the status-quo,\\" she said. Jefferson was forced into the runoff against Carter when he failed to win 50 percent of the vote in a crowded open multiparty primary. Carter had sought to become the first black woman from Louisiana elected to Congress. He described his win as \\"a great moment, and I thank almighty God for making it possible.\\" He called for regional unity to focus on the hurricane recovery and in bringing back evacuees who are still scattered across the country. His presence in Washington could be embarrassing for Democrats, who won control of Congress on a platform of cleaning up corruption. In June, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, led a successful effort to remove Jefferson from the powerful House Ways and Means Committee as the probe unfolded. He was accused of taking bribes from a company seeking lucrative contracts in the Nigerian telecommunications market. He has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. The scandal turned the race into a debate largely divided along racial lines, an age-old dynamic in this city that has intensified since Hurricane Katrina displaced large numbers of blacks and upended their demographic and political dominance. Whites, who overwhelmingly voted for Carter in the primary and have been her most enthusiastic financial backers, believed a Jefferson win would confirm this city's image as corrupt and untrustworthy as it asks the nation to fund its recovery from Katrina. City Councilman Oliver Thomas said Jefferson's success would make the recovery more difficult. \\"People are watching this election all around the country, and I can only imagine what they are thinking,\\" Thomas said. \\"It will be very difficult to go back to them and ask them to trust us with the money we need here.\\" Carter's campaign spokesman and father, Ken Carter, said he felt they had done all they could to compete against Jefferson, but regretted the tone of the campaign in the final stages. \\"Race is all too often a factor in campaigns in New Orleans,\\" Ken Carter said. \\"Here we had a candidate that tried to paint this young African-American woman as a pawn of the white establishment.\\" One white voter, George Christen, a registered independent, cast his ballot in a predominantly white precinct in the Algiers neighborhood, just across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \\"I just didn't want Jefferson in. Period,\\" said Christen, 42. \\"Jefferson is an embarrassment. He needs to be out.\\" Jefferson did get a vote from Jene Allen, who is black. \\"He started the job. Let him finish it,\\" said Allen, who wouldn't give her age. \\"I know Karen Carter would be the first black woman, but I think she played it dirty, too dirty.\\" Jefferson drew widespread support among blacks who are skeptical of the federal government's motives in its investigation of him. He repeatedly suggested the probe is groundless because he has yet to be indicted more than a year after the FBI raided his home in New Orleans. Carter, 37, raised nearly five times as much money as Jefferson, but she was largely outflanked in the endorsement game. Jefferson picked up the backing of Mayor Ray Nagin and other prominent black politicians. The endorsements spoke to Jefferson's solid footing in New Orleans politics. He arrived here in the 1970s as a Harvard-educated lawyer from rural north Louisiana, the sixth of 10 children brought up in a three-room country home. By 1980, he represented New Orleans in the state Senate. At 42, he became the first black from Louisiana in the House since Reconstruction. The law firm Jefferson founded became the largest black-owned practice in the South. He created a political organization, the Progressive Democrats, which fielded candidates for the school board, assessors' races, state House seats and mayoral contests. Before the bribery scandal erupted, Jefferson had climbed to the pinnacle of the Democratic Party. He was a confidant of former President Bill Clinton and held a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.

Fact 2: Air pollution is caused by the build-up of harmful gases and particles in the air. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does a gas mask keep out?\\" with the following options: - disease - The atmosphere - heat energy - air pollution - energy barrier - Bodily water - Dehydration - bacteria The answer is:","completion":"Air pollution. A breathing mask, or more commonly known as a gas mask, is designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful airborne substances. It functions by filtering the surrounding air, providing a barrier to prevent the entry of dangerous particles and gases into the wearer's respiratory system. Given the two facts provided, we can analyze how a gas mask works to keep a person safe from these hazards. Fact 1: A breathing mask is used for keeping harmful particles from entering the respiratory system. This statement highlights the primary function of a gas mask, which is to act as a filter for inhaled air. It achieves this through a combination of physical barriers and specialized filter materials, preventing the penetration of hazardous particles such as dust, smoke, and airborne pathogens. Fact 2: Air pollution is caused by the build-up of harmful gases and particles in the air. Many of these harmful substances are generated through human activities, such as exhaust emissions from vehicles, industrial processes, and the burning of fossil fuels. In addition, natural events like volcanic eruptions and forest fires can also cause the release of hazardous particles and gases. Given these two facts, it is clear that a gas mask's primary purpose is to keep air pollution out, specifically by filtering harmful particles and gases from the air that can pose a risk to human health. Now let's examine the other options provided: 1. Disease: While a gas mask can help reduce exposure to airborne pathogens, it is not specifically designed to keep out diseases. Its primary function is to filter out harmful particles and gases, which can indirectly help reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with air pollution. 2. The atmosphere: The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding the Earth, and a gas mask cannot keep out the entire atmosphere. It is designed to filter out specific harmful particles and gases from the air, not block out the entire atmosphere. 3. Heat energy: A gas mask is not intended to provide protection against elevated temperatures or heat energy. Specialized equipment, such as heat-resistant clothing and protective gear, are necessary for safeguarding against heat exposure. 4. Energy barrier: Gas masks are not designed to create or interact with energy barriers, which are typically the realm of science fiction. 5. Bodily water: Gas masks are designed to protect the respiratory system, and they have no function related to bodily water regulation or filtration. 6. Dehydration: Gas masks do not address dehydration issues, as they are strictly focused on filtering air pollutants. 7. Bacteria: Although some gas mask filters can help block out specific types of airborne bacteria, their primary purpose is to protect against air pollution. Gas masks are not designed specifically to keep bacteria out but can have a secondary benefit of reducing exposure to some forms of bacteria found in polluted air. In conclusion, based on the facts provided and subsequent analysis, a gas mask is designed to keep out air pollution by filtering harmful particles and gases from the air. While some secondary benefits can include reducing exposure to certain types of bacteria and airborne pathogens, the main function of a gas mask remains air pollution protection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No clear morphological features characterize all of the Cyatheales, but DNA sequence data indicate the order is monophyletic. Some species in the Cyatheales have tree-like growth forms, but others have rhizomes. - The Cyatheaceae are the scaly tree fern family and include the world 's tallest tree ferns , which reach heights up to 20 m. They are also very ancient plants , appearing in the fossil record in the late Jurassic , though the modern genera likely appeared in the Cenozoic . Cyatheaceae are the largest family of tree ferns , including about 500 species . Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae , together with Metaxyaceae and Cibotiaceae , are a monophyletic group and constitute the \`\` core tree ferns '' . Cyatheaceae are leptosporangiate ferns , the most familiar group of monilophytes . The Cyatheaceae usually have a single , erect trunk - like rhizome ( stem ) . Their fronds ( leaves ) are also very large , some of the largest in the plant kingdom . Some species have fronds reaching 3 -- 4 m in length , and have a final crown width of some 6 m. The fronds are circinate before unfolding and usually pinnately or bipinnately compound , with deeply pinnately lobed leaflets . The large leaves are covered in scales and hairs , and bear sori ( spore clusters ) on their undersides . The sori are often covered by a flap of tissue called an indusium , a useful characteristic for classifying the Cyatheaceae . Some indusia are cup - shaped ( cyatheoid ) , while others are hood - shaped ( hemitelioid ) , enclose the sorus ( sphaeropteroid ) , or scaly . Like most ferns , members of the Cyatheaceae are homosporous . Cyatheaceae are found in both New and Old World tropical wet montane forests and cloud forests , with some species extending into south - temperate regions . Most Cyatheaceae are terrestrial , with one sometimes being epiphytic and others having a creeping habit , but these are exceptions to the family norm . Cyatheaceae can be distinguished from arborescent Dicksonia by the presence of scales , the position of the sori , and the morphology of sporangia and spores . In the Cyatheaceae , the sori occur away from the margins of the pinnules , and are elongate or rounded . Since the exact number of species is not known ,... - Cyathea is a genus of tree ferns, the type genus of the fern order Cyatheales. - The Cenozoic Era (also Cænozoic, Caenozoic or Cainozoic ; meaning \\"new life\\", from Greek \\"kainos\\" \\"new\\", and \\"zoe\\" \\"life\\") is the current and most recent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day. - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Late Jurassic is the third epoch of the Jurassic period, and it spans the geologic time from 161.2 ± 4.0 to 145.5 ± 4.0 million years ago (Ma), which is preserved in Upper Jurassic strata. In European lithostratigraphy, the name \\"malm\\" indicates rocks of Late Jurassic age. In the past, this name was also used to indicate the unit of geological time, but this usage is now discouraged to make a clear distinction between lithostratigraphic and geochronologic/chronostratigraphic units. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.

Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers in relation to the context. - New knowledge: This is relevant because analyzing information typically leads to learning new things. - Enlightened: This term suggests gaining wisdom or insight, which could be relevant but is more abstract. - Facts: This is somewhat relevant, as analyzing information might uncover new facts, but it doesn't encompass the complete process of learning. - Discovering truth: Another abstract answer, indicating that analyzing information might reveal truth, but not necessarily new knowledge. - Learn more about: While relevant, this answer lacks specificity about Sean's goal in analyzing information. Step 3: Align the answers with human common sense. Common sense tells us that when someone enjoys analyzing information, their goal is to gain new knowledge. As a result, people would naturally associate \\"new knowledge\\" with the process of learning through analysis. The other possible answers may contribute to learning, but \\"new knowledge\\" directly aligns with the idea of gaining new information through analysis, which is aligned with human common sense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Bataan Movie plot: The film opens with long lines of tired and grim soldiers and civilians moving through a congested town away from the advancing Japanese (who are not shown but the hopelessness of the situation hangs heavy). Sergeant Bill Dane (Robert Taylor) of the 31st Infantry and his companion Corporal Jake Feingold (Thomas Mitchell) are seen manning a defensive position. They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.Their commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross. Lassiter makes it clear they are to demolish the bridge, stop the \\"Japs\\", and hold until MacArthur can consolidate in Bataan. They are given such equipment and supplies as is available and left alone.After the army and some civilians cross the bridge, Dane, Feingold, and a group of eleven hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible.

I chose a gun instead of a knife for defense in the fight because the","completion":"gun presented several advantages that I believed would increase my chances of success during the altercation. The decision to opt for a firearm in this situation, despite the potential drawbacks and broader consequences, was based on a thorough evaluation of the pros and cons. First and foremost, a gun offers a significant range advantage compared to a knife. In a high-stress, life-or-death scenario, maintaining distance from a potential attacker is a crucial aspect of self-preservation. A firearm allows me to engage threats from both short and long distances, providing me with an opportunity to protect myself and others around me while minimizing the risk of harm. On the other hand, using a knife would require close-quarters combat, which significantly increases the likelihood of injury to either party involved. Secondly, a gun often has an intimidation factor that a knife lacks. The mere sight of a firearm can deter an attacker, preventing an incident from escalating further. Additionally, the loud noise produced by a gunshot can draw attention and potentially dissuade an assailant from continuing their attack. A knife, while still potentially deadly, doesn't have quite the same impact on an aggressor's mindset. The stopping power of a gun is another critical advantage. In many cases, a single shot can incapacitate an assailant, allowing for a quick resolution to a dangerous situation. This is particularly important when considering multiple potential attackers, as the ability to neutralize one threat rapidly can give me time to address other threats. In contrast, a knife not only requires more physical strength and skill to be effective but also may not immediately disable an attacker, prolonging the confrontation and increasing the risk of injury to myself and others. Furthermore, the versatility of a gun also played a significant role in my decision. Depending on the type of firearm, I could choose between different ammunition types, allowing for non-lethal options such as rubber bullets or bean bag rounds. This flexibility gives me the ability to respond appropriately to varying threat levels and make split-second decisions that can help prevent unnecessary loss of life. In conclusion, although both the gun and knife have their merits in a self-defense scenario, the gun ultimately offers a superior combination of range, stopping power, intimidation factor, and versatility. I recognize that carrying a firearm entails a substantial responsibility and potential consequences, from lethal results to legal ramifications. Nonetheless, in a life-threatening situation, the careful and considered use of a gun can significantly improve the odds of survival for myself and others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Iott says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as 2003), but did so with his son \\"as a father-son bonding thing.\\" He says his name and pictures were removed from the Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years ago, after his son lost interest. Iott participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias \\"Reinhard Pferdmann,\\" which has also been removed, and which Iott described as being his German alter ego. \\"Part of the reenactor's [experience],\\" Iott said, \\"is the living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,' 'pferd' is a horse. So it's literally 'horse man.'\\" Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, Iott said he hoped it would not: \\"They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past. ... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.\\" Iott at Nazi re-enactment. Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district, disagreed. \\"Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,\\" he said. \\"I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the Jewish community, but the broader community.\\" In a follow-up email today, Iott seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: \\"Never, in any of my reenacting of military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life.\\" He added that he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II American infantryman and paratrooper. The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book \\"The Death Marches of Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,\\" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to American forces in Austria. \\"What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,\\" says Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. \\"The entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slavs were going to be enslaved in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East.

Symbiosis played a major role in the co-evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them. Many plants that are pollinated by insects, bats, or birds have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is also correspondingly adapted. The first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers. Adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants, and, at the same time, corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups. Some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen, while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources. In some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent, where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What animals need to be modified in order to be correspondingly adapted?","completion":"To answer your question, the animals that need to be modified in order to be correspondingly adapted to specific plants are typically insects, bats, and birds, as these are the primary pollinators. The modifications in these animals would be dependent on the specific plant species they need to pollinate and the characteristics of the plant's flower. Adaptations can include changes in morphology, behavior, or sensory capabilities to access, collect, and transfer pollen more effectively. For example, bees are known to have evolved specialized pollen-carrying structures and proboscises adapted to access nectar in flowers. In some cases, flowers have coevolved with specific pollinating animals to such an extent that the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of animal. For these specialized relationships to occur, both the plant and the specific pollinator need to evolve in a way that their adaptations complement each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Patient A is a smoker, but patient B is not a smoker. Patient C uses sunscreen, but patient D does not use any sunscreen. Patient E tans with tanning lamps, but patient F tans in the sun. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would patient E more likely or equally likely to risk skin cancer as patient F? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's review the information provided in the paragraph and consider the factors that may contribute to the risk of skin cancer. 1. Identify key factors: In this case, we are looking at tanning methods to determine the risk of skin cancer. 2. Compare the tanning methods for patients E and F: Patient E tans using tanning lamps, while Patient F tans in the sun. Now that we have identified the methods used by patient E and patient F to tan, let's evaluate the risk for both patients: 3. Research the risks associated with tanning lamps: Tanning lamps emit UVA and UVB radiation that has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. The use of tanning lamps is not considered safe and can significantly contribute to the overall risk of developing skin cancer. 4. Research the risks associated with sun tanning: Sun tanning also exposes the skin to UVA and UVB rays that increase the risk of skin cancer. However, this risk can be mitigated by using protective measures like sunscreen and limiting sun exposure during peak hours. Based on the information given, it seems that both methods of tanning increase the risk of skin cancer due to exposure to UVA and UVB rays. However, tanning lamps are generally considered to pose a higher risk than sun tanning, particularly when sun exposure is managed responsibly with protective measures. In conclusion, patient E, who tans using tanning lamps, is more likely to risk skin cancer than patient F, who tans in the sun."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a set of queries separated by ' ', and your job is to find out the query which is not a well-formed or well-structured query in terms of grammar, punctuations, or spelling errors.

Step 4: Formulate a response that directly answers the question with justification. Since the context provided states that people in this place don't age quickly, it is likely that the reason the narrator's skin appears radiant and young is due to the inherent characteristics of the environment they live in. The slowed aging process combined with the possibility of there being specific elements present in their surroundings that maintain youthful skin results in a radiant and young appearance.

Write highlights for this article: Brooklyn, New York (CNN)A New York police officer was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed Brooklyn man in November. Officer Peter Liang was arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court for \\"recklessly\\" causing the death of Akai Gurley, according to court documents. In addition to the manslaughter charge, Liang faces one count of criminally negligent homicide, one count of second-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of official misconduct. He was released without bail. If Liang were convicted on the charge of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison. \\"The defendant ignored his training\\" when he used his firearm, lead prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court. The defendant also did not try to help Gurley, instead retreating to a hallway and telling a fellow officer \\"I'm going to get fired,\\" Fliedner said. The prosecution will prove Liang made a \\"deliberate motion\\" with his firearm, he added. CNN tried to get a comment after court from defense attorney Stephen Worth but was unsuccessful. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson thanked Fliedner and others \\"who worked so hard on this case so that the judicial process could be conducted fairly.\\" Thompson also thanked NYPD officers for their assistance. It was important to \\"recognize the courage and valor\\" that many officers showed when they responded to the scene, he said. Several officers tried to stop Gurley's bleeding. Prosecutors don't believe Liang intentionally killed Gurley, the DA said, but he had his finger on the trigger and an innocent man was killed. Gurley, 28, was \\"a total innocent who just happened\\" to run into Liang in a \\"pitch black\\" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an \\"accidental discharge.\\" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. \\"This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,\\" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. \\"The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident.\\" Liang and his partner were part of a \\"violence reduction overtime detail\\" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer fired his weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon \\"for safety reasons,\\" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers \\"based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm.\\" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. Gurley's shooting occurred at a time of strained police-community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. A few weeks after Garner's death, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Darren Wilson, a decision that led to national demonstrations.","completion":"1.

Plot title: Drop Zone Movie plot: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

While in mid-air, Pete and Ty engage in a high-stakes skydiving battle. In the midst of their fight, Pete manages to snatch the disk containing the undercover agents' names from Ty. Then, in a desperate attempt to kill Pete, Ty tries to shoot him with a pistol, but Pete successfully kicks the weapon away. The two continue to fight while free-falling through the sky. As they near the ground, Pete manages to deploy his parachute, but Ty struggles with his own chute, which Pete had damaged during their struggle. Finally, Ty manages to deploy a reserve chute, but it is too late. The chute only partially opens, and Ty's descent is not slowed enough to prevent him from hitting the ground at a fatal speed. Ty Moncrief's death is a result of a combination of his intense mid-air battle with Pete, the damage to his primary parachute, his inability to properly deploy his reserve chute in time, and ultimately, the impact of his high-speed collision with the ground."},{"prompt":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

The Cygnet was a powered version of the tetrahedral kite designed by a Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who is credited with founding what in 1885? The answer is:","completion":"Alexander Graham Bell is the Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite. He is also credited with founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1885. Alexander Graham Bell, who is best known for inventing the telephone, had a strong interest in aeronautics and aviation. In the early 1900s, Bell began experimenting with tetrahedral kites as he believed they had great potential in the field of aviation. The tetrahedral kite is a kite constructed of pyramid-shaped cells and is known for its stability, strength, and lightness. Bell experimented with different variations of the tetrahedral kite to improve its aerodynamics and lift capacity. In 1907, he designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite. The Cygnet incorporated a small internal combustion engine, which drove two propellers, with a pilot also on board. The Cygnet had a total of 3,393 tetrahedron wing cells and was the first powered aircraft Bell built. On December 6, 1907, the Cygnet was tested by the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA) at Bras d'Or Lake in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The AEA was founded by Alexander Graham Bell, Glenn Curtiss, Frederic Baldwin, J.A.D. McCurdy, and Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge, who shared a common interest in aviation. The pilot on the Cygnet's inaugural flight was Lieutenant Selfridge. He rode on the wing of the unconventional aircraft while tethered to a boat. Although the Cygnet only managed to rise slightly above the water before crashing, the tetrahedral kite still proved to be resilient and held together after the crash. In 1885, Bell played a crucial role in founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). The AIEE was a professional organization aimed at promoting knowledge, exchanging ideas, and standardizing best practices among the electrical engineering community. As the field of electrical engineering grew rapidly, the AIEE was instrumental in supporting engineers, researchers, and inventors working on groundbreaking electrical innovations. In 1963, the AIEE merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE is now the largest professional engineering organization globally, representing individuals in various areas of electrical, electronics, communications, and related fields. In conclusion, Alexander Graham Bell designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite, and is credited with founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1885. Bell's contributions to both aviation and electrical engineering have had a lasting impact on the development of new technologies and innovations, setting the foundation for many modern advancements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nebraska-based Molly Schuyler, 34, a competitive eater with several food guzzling accolades to her name already, smashed the previous world record, which was a paltry 2lbs 15oz of pudding in the same time. The stomach-churning feat was performed on Dish Nation and uploaded to YouTube, and sees the slim brunette consume a whopping 15,120 calories in one sitting - that's the equivalent of over seven days' worth of recommended calorie intake for a woman. Scroll down for video. Pudding guzzler: Molly Schuyler, a 34-year-old mother-of-four, consumed exactly 12lbs of pudding in a record-smashing three minutes, earning herself a Guiness World Record. In the three minute stunt, which tows the fine like between revolting and riveting, Ms Schuyler crouches eagerly over the enormous glass bowl of creamy pudding and shovels it down her throat with hawk-like concentration and lightning-fast spoon-to-mouth motion. The five hosts behind her observe slack-jawed with disbelief, one repeatedly questioning: 'Is she even breathing?' 'I don’t think she’s swallowing, I think it’s just, like, this natural gravitational pull', observes another. Determination: The bony speed-eating champion barely came up for air once during the bizarre feat, leading one stunned host to question whether she was even breathing. She certainly earned that! Ms Schuyler beat the previous world record an astonishing six times over, devouring more than a week's worth of recommended calorie intake in just one sitting. At one point, Ms Schuyler pauses to let out an almighty belch, before dutifully returning to the task at hand, her cheeks smeared with the custard colored goop. 'I'm so scared for what's going to happen after!' squeals one queasy looking judge, sheepishly clutching a black garbage bin in preparation for a possible resurgence. But no, Ms Schuyler completes the task and gracefully accepts her certificate as she is welcomed into the Guiness World Record 'family'. Where did it all go? With a petite frame, at 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible. Make mine a large! Ms Schuyler has been competitive eating for less than a year and says she eats to support her four kids. Not only has the ravenous mother defied previous records, she's overcome the normal abilities of the human stomach, which can usually only stretch to hold a capacity of 8lbs. And it's far from the first time she has demonstrated her eating prowess for the world to see. She is currently ranked the number one Female Independent Competitive Eater in the world. Other records include demolishing a 12lb sandwich washed down with 1lb of French fries in just under an hour - the only woman to even finish this particular challenge. Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat. New-found skill: The full-time server only started eating competitively last August. She also devoured a 72oz steak, the size of a newborn baby, in under three minutes in January of this year, and competed in over 20 different food eating contests nationwide in 2013. Ms Schuyler, who serves food for a living, has spoken previously of her unusual talent, saying: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon. I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.' Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In an impressive display of competitive eating, Nebraska-based Molly Schuyler, a 34-year-old mother-of-four, set a new Guinness World Record by consuming 12lbs of pudding in a mere three minutes. This achievement greatly exceeds the previous record, which involved eating 2lbs 15oz of pudding in the same time span. Schuyler demonstrated this feat on Dish Nation, and the video can be found on YouTube. Her remarkable consumption amounted to an incredible 15,120 calories, which equates to over seven days' worth of recommended calorie intake for a woman. She performed the task with remarkable focus and speed, quickly spooning the pudding into her mouth to the astonishment of the five observing hosts. What stands out about Schuyler isn't just her eating habits, but also her physical figure: she is incredibly slender for a woman who has won numerous food-eating competitions. At 5ft 7in and 125 lbs, her capacity to consume such great quantities of food is genuinely astounding. Notably, a standard human stomach typically has a maximum stretch capacity of only 8 lbs. Being ranked as the number one Female Independent Competitive Eater in the world, this accomplishment is not Schuyler's first feat. Her previous records are equally imposing, including finishing a 12lb sandwich and 1lb of French fries in under an hour - the only woman to complete this challenge. Earlier this year, she devoured a 72oz steak, analogous in size to a newborn baby, in less than three minutes. She participated in over 20 different food eating contests across the nation in 2013, showcasing her capacity to consume considerable portions of food consistently. Schuyler works as a server and has been involved in competitive eating for less than a year. Her husband, Sean, admires her eating abilities, and Schuyler herself refers to it as an 'unexplained phenomenon,' adding: \\"I was just born that way.\\" Her speed-eating ability and slender physique are fascinating juxtapositions, providing an intriguing narrative and earning her a prominent place in competitive eating circles and beyond. Apart from establishing a new world record, Schuyler's achievements serve as a testament to the surprising capabilities and quirks of the human body, as well as underlining the astonishing diversity found within the competitive eating sector. Despite the shock and disbelief expressed by some observers of this kind of sport, there's no denying the mesmerizing appeal of these feats - a blend of the bizarre, unexpected, and extraordinary that keeps spectators eagerly anticipating the next record-breaking attempt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Housing has become a major obstacle for Chinese young men hoping to start a family. China may breed a new group of bachelors, men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses. Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority and that women see an apartment as essential to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas. Social housing, provided by European authorities, offer the less wealthy people their own piece of real estate. Such housing is usually apartments in tall buildings with 10 or more floors on the _ of town, whose main advantage is the low rents.

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further. Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India.

To answer your first question, the Vietnam War does not have a clear victor in the traditional sense. It is generally acknowledged that the North Vietnamese forces and the Viet Cong, who were fighting to reunify Vietnam under a single, communist government, managed to fulfill their objectives after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 1973 and South Vietnam fell in 1975.

Answer the following question: Process: - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less stormy weather happens, how will it affect slower weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if there is less stormy weather, the rate or intensity of weathering might be affected. To determine the impact of the perturbation and if it has a direct or indirect effect on the process, we need to examine how storms play a role in the weathering of rocks and the role of plants in that process. Mechanical weathering (also known as physical weathering) refers to the natural process where rocks are broken down into smaller pieces by various factors such as temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and the growth of plants (as mentioned in the process question). Chemical weathering refers to chemical transformations which cause rocks to disintegrate, dissolve, or to become more susceptible to other weathering processes. Stormy weather can lead to higher rates of both mechanical and chemical weathering. In the case of mechanical weathering, strong winds, heavy rain, and fluctuations in temperature can cause rocks to crack, break, and disintegrate into smaller pieces. Similarly, the flow of water caused by rainstorms can lead to erosion, which further accelerates the breakdown of rock material. Chemical weathering can also be intensified by stormy weather, as rainfall and fluctuations in pH levels can encourage the dissolution of rock components. Now, let's examine the process involving the plant growing near or on a rock. The plant's roots exert pressure on the rock as they grow, causing additional mechanical weathering. Additionally, the plant's acids dissolve parts of the rock, contributing to the chemical weathering process. If less stormy weather occurs, the immediate effect may be a decrease in weathering rates due to reduced mechanical and chemical forces acting on the rocks. This can lead to slower surface erosion, and potentially fewer cracks and openings in the rocks for the plant roots to penetrate. However, the plant's growth and presence on or near the rock will still contribute to the weathering process, albeit at a potentially slower pace. In this scenario, the perturbation of less stormy weather has a direct effect on the overall rate of weathering due to the causal relationship between storm intensity and both mechanical and chemical weathering rates. The plant's role in the weathering process will still occur but may be indirectly affected by the reduced weathering rates caused by the absence of stormy weather. To summarize, the perturbation of less stormy weather will likely lead to slower weathering occurring and will have a direct effect on the weathering process. The plant's role in the weathering process might be indirectly affected, as the reduced weathering rates may change the rate or ease at which the plant can break the rocks apart, but the plant will still be a contributing factor in the overall weathering process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact 2: Heat is caused by molecules moving. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What causes causes thermal expansion?\\" with the following options: - molecules moving - kinetic energy - Electrical energy - Evaporation - molecules stopping - sunlight - molecules slowing down - molecules standing still Answer:","completion":"Thermal expansion is predominantly caused by molecules moving, which is also a manifestation of kinetic energy. To understand this, we must delve deeper into the relationship between these factors and their effect on the phenomenon of thermal expansion. When heat is introduced to a substance, the increased energy causes the molecules to move more rapidly. This movement is in the form of kinetic energy, which is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. As these molecules move more quickly, they transfer this kinetic energy to other molecules within the substance through collisions, causing them to vibrate more rapidly as well. As these vibrations increase, the substance's molecules begin to push further away from each other, resulting in thermal expansion. In some materials, the amount of expansion is directly proportional to the increase in temperature. Thermal expansion is an essential consideration in various applications, including construction, engineering, and manufacturing, where materials undergo changes in temperature during their lifecycle. Though other factors listed in the options can play some role in causing the molecules to move more rapidly, they are not the primary causes of thermal expansion. For instance: - Electrical energy: In some instances, it can generate heat and lead to molecular motion, but it is not a direct cause of thermal expansion. - Evaporation: This is a process where molecules with relatively high kinetic energy escape the surface of a liquid and become vapor. It is not a direct cause of thermal expansion, though it shares a relationship with heat. - Sunlight: It is a source of heat, but it is not the direct cause of thermal expansion. Rather, sunlight can cause the temperature to rise and subsequently cause molecules to move faster, indirectly causing thermal expansion. - Lastly, options like molecules stopping, slowing down, or standing still are not causes of thermal expansion. On the contrary, these options tend to result in the opposite effect - which is thermal contraction or a decrease in a substance's volume. In conclusion, while some factors such as sunlight or electrical energy are indirectly related to thermal expansion by causing a temperature increase, the direct cause of thermal expansion lies in the molecules moving more rapidly due to the additional kinetic energy they possess."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Answer:","completion":"Preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past are known as fossils. Fossils provide critical evidence about the history of life on Earth, allowing scientists to study the evolution of species, their distribution over time, and the environmental conditions that prevailed in different epochs. Fossils can be categorized into two main types: body fossils and trace fossils. Body fossils are the preserved remains of an organism's body parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, and even soft tissues in rare cases. Trace fossils, on the other hand, are indirect evidence of an organism's existence, such as footprints, burrows, nests, or coprolites (fossilized feces). The process of fossilization involves several key factors, including rapid burial, the absence of oxygen, and the presence of minerals. Typically, an organism must be quickly buried in sediment, such as mud or sand, to prevent decomposition and scavengers from destroying its remains. Over time, unaltered remains such as shells, teeth, and bones may become surrounded and filled with minerals, turning them into fossils. In some instances, the original organic materials are replaced with minerals, resulting in petrifaction (also known as permineralization), a phenomenon that preserves the organism's original structure in great detail. Fossils can provide essential information to paleontologists, scientists who study the history of life on Earth. By examining the morphology and distribution of fossils, paleontologists can understand how ancient organisms lived, died, and evolved. They can also make inferences about an organism's habitat, diet, and behavior. Furthermore, the study of fossils helps researchers create a comprehensive picture of the geological timescale, as well as the reasons behind mass extinction events in Earth's history. The discovery and collection of fossils are often conducted through a systematic process known as fossil excavation or paleontological fieldwork. This involves identifying potential fossil-bearing sites (usually sedimentary rock formations), carefully excavating the fossils, and collecting relevant contextual information, such as the stratigraphic layers and surrounding rock types. Once collected, fossils are cleaned, preserved, and categorized for further study in laboratories and museums. Fossil discoveries have played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the history of life on Earth. For example, the famous fossils of Archaeopteryx, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, provided compelling evidence in support of the theory of evolution. Similarly, the numerous transitional forms found within the fossil record showcase the gradual evolutionary changes experienced by various lineages over millions of years. In summary, fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past, providing crucial information about the history and evolution of life on Earth. With the help of fossils, paleontologists can study species' morphological and ecological changes, reconstruct the geological timescale, and gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between life and Earth's changing environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Street lamps and the outlines of buildings receded into a white haze as pedestrians donned face masks to guard against the caustic air. The flight cancellations stranded passengers during the first week of the country's peak, six-week period for travel surrounding the Chinese New Year on Feb. 10. The U.S. Embassy reported an hourly peak level of PM2.5 _ tiny particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs _ at 526 micrograms per cubic meter, or \\"beyond index,\\" and more than 20 times higher than World Health Organization safety levels over a 24-hour period. Liu Peng, an employee at a financial institution in Beijing, said he will keep his newborn baby indoors. \\"It's really bad for your health, obviously,\\" Liu said. \\"I bike to work every day and always wear a mask. The pollution in recent years is probably due to the increase in private cars and government cars.\\" Visibility was less than 100 meters (100 yards) in some areas of eastern China, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More than 100 flights were canceled in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, 33 in Beijing, 20 in Qingdao and 13 in Jinan. Every year, China's transport system bursts at the seams as tens of millions of people travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, in the world's largest seasonal migration of people. Ren Haiqiang, a bank worker in his early 30s, said he had booked tickets to fly out of Beijing on Thursday to visit family in the coastal city of Dalian, but now worried about flight cancellations. \\"Traveling over the holiday is already a huge hassle, along with all the gift-giving and family visits. We thought flying would be the best way to avoid the crush, but if the weather continues like this we'll be in real trouble,\\" Ren said as he waited in line at a bakery in downtown Beijing. Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third, Xinhua said. The measures last until Thursday. Beijing's official readings for PM2.5 were lower than the embassy's _ 433 micrograms per cubic meter at one point in the afternoon_ but even that level is considered \\"severe\\" and prompted the city government to advise residents to stay indoors as much as possible. The government said that because there was no wind, the smog probably would not dissipate quickly. Patients seeking treatment for respiratory ailments rose by about 30 percent over the past month at the Jiangong Hospital in downtown Beijing, Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng said. \\"People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air,\\" he said. Air pollution has long been a problem in Beijing, but the country has been more open about releasing statistics on PM2.5 _ considered a more accurate reflection of air quality than other pollutants _ only since early last year. The city hit its highest readings on Jan. 12, when U.S. Embassy readings of PM2.5 reached as high as 886 micrograms per cubic meter. Celebrity real estate developer Pan Shiyi, who has previously pushed for cities to publish more detailed air quality data and who is a delegate to Beijing's legislature, called Tuesday morning for a \\"Clean Air Act.\\" By late afternoon, his online poll had received more than 29,000 votes, with 99 percent in favor. On Monday, Wang Anshun was elected Beijing's mayor after telling lawmakers the municipal government should make more efforts to fight air pollution, according to Xinhua. Last week, he announced plans to remove 180,000 older vehicles from the city's roads and promote government cars and heating systems that use clean energy. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen and researcher Flora Ji contributed to this report. ||||| Photographer Goran Tomasevic captures the moment two Syrian rebels are hit by sniper fire in Damascus. BEIJING | BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing temporarily shut down 103 heavily polluting factories and took 30 percent of government vehicles off roads to combat dangerously high air pollution, state media reported on Tuesday, but the capital's air remained hazardous despite the measures. Air quality in Beijing has mostly stayed above \\"very unhealthy\\" and \\"hazardous\\" levels for about two weeks. On Tuesday, it hit 517 on an index maintained by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which described the pollution as \\"Beyond Index\\". Pollution in Beijing regularly exceeds 500 on an index that measures particulate matter in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers. Above 300 is considered hazardous, while the World Health Organisation recommends a daily level of no more than 20. Earlier this month pollution hit a record, 30-45 times above recommended safety levels, blanketing the city in a thick, noxious cloud that grounded flights and forced people indoors. Beijing's pollution problem has caused widespread public outrage, alarming the ruling Communist Party, which has failed to rein in pollution despite repeated pledges to get tough. Premier Wen Jiabao told top leaders at a forum that the \\"recent fog and haze have affected the people's normal life and health\\". \\"We should take effective measures to speed up the enhancement of our industrial structure, push for energy conservation and build an ecological civilisation,\\" Wen was quoted as saying on state television. \\"Use actions so that the people can see hope.\\" State news agency Xinhua said the Beijing municipal government held an urgent meeting on Tuesday \\"for the emergency work of controlling the heavy air pollution\\". \\"All counties, departments, businesses and institutions should take the lead in suspending the service of 30 percent of official vehicles,\\" Xinhua said. Beijing would also shut down 103 heavily polluting businesses. But the emergency measures only last until Thursday. The government has already announced that it would take 180,000 old vehicles off the roads in Beijing this year and control the \\"excessive\\" growth of new car sales in the city.

Next question: the invention of linear perspective is generally attributed to?","completion":"The invention of linear perspective is generally attributed to the Italian Renaissance architect, artist, and mathematician Filippo Brunelleschi. Born in Florence around 1377, Brunelleschi played a revolutionary role in the history of art, owing largely to his groundbreaking development of linear perspective, among other achievements. Linear perspective is a technique that uses mathematical and geometric principles to create the illusion of a three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. It enables artists to represent objects and scenes more accurately, capturing their relative sizes, proportions, and positions as they recede into the distance. The key idea behind linear perspective involves a vanishing point, which is typically placed at the viewer's eye level. Converging lines are drawn from the vanishing point, assisting in the portrayal of depth and volume. Brunelleschi's invention of linear perspective is believed to have occurred during the early 15th century, between 1410 and 1420, as a result of his extensive studies in the field of optics and geometry. Prior to this time, most art was characterized by stylized and abstract representations, with little attention to accurately representing objects in a three-dimensional space. Due to the lack of a unified system, artists relied heavily on their intuitions, resulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies in their artworks. It is said that Brunelleschi first demonstrated the principles of linear perspective through a few notable experiments. One of these involved creating a painted panel of the Florence Baptistery, observable through a hole in the painting's back when reflected in a mirror. By aligning the vanishing point of the painting with the viewer's eye, he produced an illusion of depth that convincingly matched the real-world view. Another experiment conducted by Brunelleschi involved constructing a set of grids on a panel, along with a small hole for the observer's eye. When placed in front of a scene, the observer could then use a lenticular device to trace the objects onto the grid, providing a proportional and accurate representation of the scene in perspective. Brunelleschi's groundbreaking work on linear perspective had a significant impact on the art world. It quickly spread throughout Florence and, subsequently, the rest of Europe. Artists like Leon Battista Alberti and Masaccio further explored and developed these perspective techniques, eventually leading to the creation of masterpieces during the Renaissance era. Alberti even penned a treatise in 1435, titled 'De pictura' ('On Painting'), which articulated the rules of linear perspective to a broad audience and solidified the significance of these concepts within the realms of art and architecture. In summary, Filippo Brunelleschi's invention of linear perspective revolutionized the art world and the ways in which artists accurately represented reality. This critical development enabled artists to create more believable, vivid, and immersive works, which greatly contributed to the remarkable advancements in art and architecture during the Renaissance period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary . - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto. What object entity has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'maria malibran'?

By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor PUBLISHED: 09:28 EST, 24 July 2013 | UPDATED: 11:08 EST, 24 July 2013 Jane Austen is to become the face of the new £10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney today unveiled the new design as a tribute to ‘one of the greatest writers in English literature’ which will appear from 2017. The move comes after the Bank faced criticism that a plan for Winston Churchill to feature on the new fiver meant there would not be a woman on any English note.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \\"DNA bomb\\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben). While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Gwen blames Ben's selfishness despite the fact that Ben had nothing to do with it. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames...

Summarize this article: You are family, though that doesn’t mean you should know everything about each other’s personal lives. Be respectful of personal space, like bedrooms, journals, or cell phones. Remembering your sibling’s boundaries will show them your love and respect. Don't read their journal or snoop around in their room when they aren't home. When you feel angry or upset, you will likely start a fight. Work on your emotions in healthy ways rather than taking them out on the people close to you. Try venting to a friend or to your parent about what is on your mind. This will get rid of your feelings so you don't carry them with you next time you talk to your brother. If you’re really angry with your brother, rather than yelling at him, try writing a letter. This is a safe place for you to vocalize your true feelings, without maybe saying harsh things to him right away. After you've written your letter, you'll be able to discuss your feelings calmly. It’s easy to forget your sibling’s friendship if you’re stuck fighting all the time. Show your brother or sister you appreciate them by doing something nice, for no reason. It’s easy to take your family for granted. You can do things like buy them ice cream or a coffee when you are running errands. Also try things like playing their favorite game together, or buy them a new coloring book or magazine. Whether you share a room with your sibling or you live across the country from each other, it’s important to spend time together when you can. Spend time together that is positive and fun, rather than spent arguing. This will strengthen your relationship and you are less likely to fight. Do an activity you both enjoy, like playing golf, walking in the park, or watching a sci-fi movie. If you tell your brother that you will stop teasing him, do it. Be accountable to what you agree upon, and your sibling will start to trust you. Trust is important to maintain healthy relationships and prevent fights. If you both agree your fights are starting because you want to be the boss, stop ordering around your sibling and let them make decisions. If your sister doesn't trust you because you always shoot her with your Nerf gun, try shooting a stationary target outside instead.

Mantel is the first woman and the first living British author to win the prestigious literary prize twice. \\"This double accolade is uniquely deserved,\\" said Sir Peter Stothard, chairman of the judges. The book is about Thomas Cromwell, an adviser to King Henry VIII, and charts the bloody downfall of Anne Boleyn. It is the second book in a trilogy. A third instalment, to be called The Mirror and the Light, will continue Cromwell's story until his execution in 1540. Mantel was announced as the winner at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Mantel's win also makes her the first person in Man Booker history to win the prize for a direct sequel. She is only the third double winner of the award, after JM Coetzee and Peter Carey. Receiving her award, she joked: \\"You wait 20 years for a Booker Prize and two come along at once.\\" She added: \\"I know how privileged and lucky I am to be standing here tonight.

She uses her power of prose to create moral ambiguity and the real uncertainty of political life.\\" He added: \\"She has recast the most essential period of our modern English history; we have the greatest modern English prose writer reviving possibly one of the best known pieces of English history. \\"It is well-trodden territory with an inevitable outcome, and yet she is able to bring it to life as though for the first time.\\" Asked whether the book qualified as a thriller, Sir Peter referenced The Godfather: \\"You can see as much Don Corleone in this book as DH Lawrence.\\" Man Booker Prize - 2012 shortlist Tan Twan Eng - The Garden of Evening Mists Deborah Levy - Swimming Home Hilary Mantel - Bring Up the Bodies Alison Moore - The Lighthouse Will Self - Umbrella Jeet Thayil - Narcopolis Mantel's latest work has been widely praised.

Answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rain is able to be absorbed into soil happens, how will it affect \\"acid rain is absorbed into the earths soil\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of acid rain being absorbed into the Earth's soil does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain production and its consequences. Direct Effects: 1. Soil Acidification: When absorbed into the soil, the acidic components of the rain (mainly sulfuric and nitric acids) will react with soil minerals and lead to a decrease in soil pH. This acidification process can negatively impact the soil's nutrient balance and bacterial activity, which in turn influences plant growth and crop production. 2. Leaching of essential nutrients: Acid rain absorbed into the soil can cause essential nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, to leach out of the soil. The loss of these vital nutrients can stunt plant growth and make them more susceptible to disease and environmental stressors. 3. Mobilization of toxic metals: Acidic conditions in soil can also cause potentially toxic metals, such as aluminum, to become more soluble and mobile. When these toxic metals are absorbed by plants or enter water bodies, they can harm aquatic ecosystems and enter the food chain, posing a risk to both wildlife and human health. Indirect Effects: 1. Impact on aquatic ecosystems: The leaching of acidic components and toxic metals from the soil into water bodies can disrupt aquatic ecosystems, leading to negative impacts on organisms such as fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. This can, in turn, lead to a decrease in overall biodiversity and affect the ecological balance of the surrounding environment. 2. Climate change feedback: Due to the detrimental effects on vegetation and ecosystems, acid rain can indirectly contribute to climate change by reducing the overall resilience of ecosystems to cope with environmental changes, such as increased temperatures and extreme weather events, resulting from climate change. 3. Human health impacts: Acid rain can also indirectly affect human health by altering the quality of the water, soil, and crops we consume. Contaminated water and food can result in deficiencies of essential nutrients, accumulation of toxic metals in the body, or exposure to harmful substances. In conclusion, the perturbation of acid rain being absorbed into the Earth's soil does have a significant effect on the overall process of acid rain production and its consequences for vegetation, ecosystems, and human health. It initiates a cascade of direct and indirect effects that disrupt natural systems and lead to long-term environmental damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Pinocchio Context: After singing the film's signature song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Tuscany workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio (a name his cat Figaro and fish Cleo both dislike). Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio would be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience. Gideon and Honest John Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings while performing with marionettes of Dutch girls, French can-can girls, and Russian Cossacks. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him up in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy then appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets them free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him. Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them big money if they can find foolish little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he...

You can tell your mother how you feel and that you’d like her to get treatment, but you can’t change her. Often, the only thing that can help an addict is for her to want help for herself and admit she has a problem. If you've tried your best to help, but always end up being hurt or ignored, it's not your fault. Nothing you did made her start doing drugs and you must never blame yourself. You haven’t failed your mother or done anything wrong for her to use drugs. Recognize your own risks associated with drugs with a close family history. Kids that have a drug using parent tend to start using drugs and earlier and harder than kids that don’t have a drug-using parent. They are also more likely to develop drug disorders. You may feel so involved with the drug problem that you forget to take care of yourself. Make sure you spend time taking care of your own needs. You don’t need to give up your social life to take care of your mother. Remember, this is her problem and unfortunately, you’re involved in it but not responsible for her. Keep your body and mind healthy, hang out with friends, and do things that make you happy. Don’t let your entire life revolve around your mother. Part of taking care of yourself is making sure you have healthy outlets for you to take out your stress, anger, sadness, pain, etc. Being a teenager is hard enough, but having to deal with the stress of having a drug addicted mother makes things a lot harder for you. Engage in activities that make you feel good in your body and your mind. Some easy ways to deal with stress include spending time in nature, writing in a journal, playing with animals, and listening to music. Exercise is a great way to release stress and keep your body happy. Go for a walk, skip, or do some jump rope. You can join sport teams at school to keep you moving. Spend time with friends. One the best ways to bust stress is to surround yourself with fun and supportive people. It’s important to have someone in your life that you trust that you can talk to about your mother’s problems and how they affect you. It’s okay to talk about the hurt, frustration, embarrassment, anger, and fear associated with your mother’s use. This can be a coach, guidance counselor, spiritual leader, aunt/uncle, or therapist. It can be helpful to find an adult that has similar experiences to you to talk to. This person can encourage you, show you that you can make it through, and be an example that things can work well for you. It's important to have people to talk to about what's happening in your life and this is really important. If you feel uncomfortable talking with someone you know personally, then here are some hotline phone numbers, and websites to help you out. For family members of alcoholics, check out Al-Anon.org (https://www.al-anon.org). For family members of addicts, check out Nar-anon (https://www.nar-anon.org) For adult children of alcoholics and addicts, check out Adultchildren.org (https://www.adultchildren.org). It can be confusing to work through having a drug addicted mother while trying to be a normal kid, go to school, have friends, and have fun. If you’re struggling to keep that balance, it can be helpful to see a therapist. Even if you cannot afford to see an outpatient therapist, you can talk to your school counselor. Therapy can help you find ways to cope and support you through difficult times. Therapy is a safe place for you to share your thoughts and feelings, cry, and be honest.

Choices: - sound well - fly - become broken - gain speed - fall into hole The rationale to choose \\"gain speed\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"As the round object rolls down the ramp, it will \\"gain speed.\\" This answer is the most appropriate choice among the given options, and the rationale behind it is based on basic physics principles, particularly the concepts of gravitational force, potential energy, and kinetic energy. When the round object is at the top of the ramp, it possesses potential energy due to its position in a gravitational field (i.e., its height above the ground). As the object starts to roll down the ramp, this potential energy is gradually converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Since kinetic energy is related to both the mass and the velocity of the object, the increasing kinetic energy means that the object's speed (or velocity) is also increasing. This can be easily explained using the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be converted from one form to another. In this case, the total mechanical energy (sum of potential and kinetic energy) of the object remains constant as it rolls down the ramp, but the distribution of energy changes from potential energy to kinetic energy. The other options, such as \\"sound well,\\" \\"fly,\\" \\"become broken,\\" and \\"fall into a hole,\\" do not accurately describe the expected behavior of a round object rolling down a ramp based on fundamental physics concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that the type of seed of a plant is an inherited characteristic to answer this question: \\"If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant\\"","completion":"To answer the question \\"If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant,\\" I will use evidence from the fact that the type of seed of a plant is an inherited characteristic: Step 1: Consider the genetic information in seeds Seeds carry genetic information from the parent plant, which determines the characteristics of the resulting plant. In this case, the characteristic we're considering is the size of the tomato plant. Step 2: Examine the inheritance of traits Traits like large tomato plant size are passed down from parent plants to their offspring through heredity. This means that the large tomato plant size is likely a result of genetics inherited from one or both of the parent plants. Step 3: Analyze the role of environmental factors While the type of seed is an inherited characteristic, it's important to consider environmental factors that may have an impact on the resulting plant's size. Proper care, such as watering, nutrient availability, and sunlight exposure, can also contribute to the development of a large tomato plant. Conclusion: If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant, this can be attributed to a combination of inherited characteristics from the parent plants and favorable environmental conditions. The seed's inherited genetic information plays a significant role in determining plant size, but factors such as proper care and overall growing conditions should also be considered for the successful development of a large tomato plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This can be thought of as a heater core filled with very cold liquid that is undergoing a phase change to gas (the evaporation), a process which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the heater core. In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action in regulating the compressor operation, amount of reheating and blower speed depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.

Article: Historically, AC motors were used for single or double speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.

From the get go I could sense how cold and un-inviting she was toward us as she said you guys here just for happy hour!? (This wasn't the first time here, and it wasn't the first time I got bad vibes from this lady either) But my family loves it and I didn't want to let bad vibes ruin it for everyone. Plus the other servers are very warm and welcoming.

Then she disappeared to cater to another couple at the sushi bar. Overhearing her telling this couple normally we can't combine groupon with happy hour but for you I will, I thought hey they will honor this for us too! Nope, not for us! We tried, I explained I heard you just a moment ago honor it. She rudely replied they are from out of town ill show you the check it was only 20 and rolled her eyes at me.

Prejudice?? Clearly, if she used her brains it would be more advantageous to treat \\"regulars\\" right and offer preferential treatment to them but she allowed her prejudice nature to get in the way.

Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in central and eastern Europe as a national revival movement, called Hovevei Tziyon, and soon after this most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The primary goals of Zionism until 1948, were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, ingathering of the exiles, and liberation of Jews from antisemitic discrimination and persecution that occurred in their diaspora. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and address threats to its continued existence and security. A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state.Republican Party:;Type: Political party. ; Solution:","completion":"Which political ideology is associated with both the [Republican Party] and political groups that adhere to [Zionism]?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears.

Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa.

If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the \\"bad guy\\", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest.

Raven is double-crossed by his employer, Willard Gates who pays him with marked bills and reports them to the Los Angeles Police Department as stolen from his company, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles. Raven learns of the setup and decides to get revenge. LAPD detective lieutenant Michael Crane, who is vacationing in San Francisco to visit his girlfriend, nightclub singer Ellen Graham, is immediately assigned the case. He goes after Raven, but the assassin eludes him. Meanwhile, Gates hires Ellen to work in his LA nightclub after an audition where she sings and performs magic tricks. Then she is taken to a clandestine meeting with Senator Burnett, where she learns that Gates and Nitro Chemical are under investigation as suspected traitors, and is recruited to spy on Gates. Unknown to each other, she and Gates board a train for Los Angeles, followed by Raven. By chance, Raven and Ellen sit next to each other. The next morning, Gates is alarmed when he sees them asleep with Raven's head on her shoulder. He wires ahead to alert the police, but Raven forces Ellen at gunpoint to help him elude them again.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: A major concern of using phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in heart failure is their potential to increase mortality by inducing arrhythmias. By diminishing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) hydrolysis, they promote protein kinase A (PKA) activity under β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, hence enhancing Ca(2+) cycling and contraction. Yet, cAMP also activates CaMKII via PKA or the exchange protein Epac, but it remains unknown whether these pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors.', 'Excitation-contraction coupling was investigated in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes loaded with Fura-2 and paced at 1 Hz allowing coincident measurement of intracellular Ca(2+) and sarcomere shortening. The PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (Ro) promoted the inotropic effects of the non-selective β-AR agonist isoprenaline (Iso) and also spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) waves (SCWs). PDE4 inhibition potentiated RyR2 and PLB phosphorylation at specific PKA and CaMKII sites increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load and SR Ca(2+) leak measured in a 0Na(+)/0Ca(2+) solution ± tetracaine. PKA inhibition suppressed all the effects of Iso ± Ro, whereas CaMKII inhibition prevented SR Ca(2+) leak and diminished SCW incidence without affecting the inotropic effects of Ro. Inhibition of Epac2 but not Epac1 diminished the occurrence of SCWs. PDE3 inhibition with cilostamide induced an SR Ca(2+) leak, which was also blocked by CaMKII inhibition. Answer: Our results show that PDE inhibitors exert inotropic effects via PKA but lead to SCWs via both PKA and CaMKII activation partly via Epac2, suggesting the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors as adjuncts to PDE inhibition to limit their pro-arrhythmic effects. Student:","completion":"Part #1: Construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage. Usage: What pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors? This question is based on the information provided in the passage, which aims to find out whether the cAMP pathways are involved in the pro-arrhythmic effect of PDE inhibitors. Part #2: The question must be unambiguous. Usage: How do PDE inhibitors exert inotropic effects and cause SCWs? This question is clear and specific, as it asks about the mechanisms through which PDE inhibitors affect both inotropic effects and SCWs. Part #3: The question should be answerable from the passage. Usage: What findings suggest the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors as adjuncts to PDE inhibition to limit pro-arrhythmic effects? This question can be answered from the passage, which states that PDE inhibitors lead to SCWs via both PKA and CaMKII activation partly via Epac2, suggesting the potential use of CaMKII inhibitors to limit the pro-arrhythmic effects. Part #4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: Which type of PDE inhibitor potentiated RyR2 and PLB phosphorylation in the study? The unique answer to this question is PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 as mentioned in the passage. Part #5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: What was the effect of PKA inhibition on the Iso ± Ro-induced effects? The answer, \\"PKA inhibition suppressed all the effects of Iso ± Ro\\", uses text phrases directly from the passage. Part #6: Avoid creating questions that can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage. Usage: Through which specific pathways does cAMP activate CaMKII? This question requires understanding the passage to answer correctly, as it states that cAMP activates CaMKII via PKA or the exchange protein Epac.

The reason why option II is correct is that it provides a solution to hiding screw heads by drilling a hole in the wood and then covering it with either screw caps or dowels. This will effectively hide the screw heads and create a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. Option I is incorrect because it mentions covering the hole in the dirt, which doesn't make sense in this context.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What two things expanded the Kink's line-up?, using the article: In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \\"fucking sick of the whole thing\\", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \\"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\\"Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: \\"[Ray] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players. ... Smoother and tighter than on record, Preservation..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The expansion of the Kinks' line-up in conjunction with the Preservation project involved the addition of two key components: a horn section and female backup singers. These additions allowed the group to essentially reconfigure itself as a theatrical troupe, a significant transformation that was vital to the execution and performance of their more ambitious and theatrical rock opera Preservation. The horn section added a rich and dynamic layer to the Kinks' sound, providing powerful brass instrumentation that complemented their rock foundation while enhancing the overall theatricality of their performances. Having a horn section broadened the range of musical styles and arrangements the Kinks could explore, contributing to a more diverse and engaging sonic experience for their listeners. Similarly, the inclusion of female backup singers played a critical role in shaping the Kinks' new theatrical identity. The involvement of these vocalists added depth and harmony to the band's sound, while also allowing for greater narrative and storytelling possibilities in their performances. The additional voices contributed to the dramatization of the Preservation rock opera, bringing characters and emotions to life in a way that would not have been possible with only the core band members. In summary, the two elements that expanded the Kinks' line-up during the Preservation project were the incorporation of a horn section and female backup singers. These additions marked a significant shift in the group's identity and sound, providing them with the resources needed to create and perform their ambitious rock opera while enhancing the overall theatricality and diversity of their musical repertoire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Located above sea level, approximately south east of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler temperatures year-round than most other Indonesian cities. The city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains. This topography provides a natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the colony capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands.

It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. - West Java (abbreviated as \\"Jabar\\") is a province of Indonesia. It is located in the western part of the island of Java and its capital and largest urban center is Bandung, although much of its population in the northwest corner of the province live in areas suburban to the even larger urban area of Jakarta, even though that city itself lies outside the administrative province. The province's population is 46.3 million (in 2014) and it is the most populous and most densely populated of Indonesia's provinces. - Sunda Kelapa is the old port of Jakarta located on the estuarine of Ciliwung River. \\"Sunda Kalapa\\" (Sundanese: \\"Coconut of Sunda\\") is the original name, and it was the main port of Hindu Sunda Kingdom of Pajajaran. The port is situated in Penjaringan sub-district, of North Jakarta, Indonesia. Today the old port only accommodate pinisi, a traditional two masted wooden sailing ship serving inter-island freight service in the archipelago. Although it is now only a minor port, Jakarta has its origins in Sunda Kelapa and it played a significant role in the city's development.

His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process. Gamble and Street are demoted by Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter), the commander of the LAPD Metropolitan Division.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the third alcoholic beverage listed\\" Context: \\"In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The third alcoholic beverage listed in the context is beer.

Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A defense lawyer for Amanda Knox made an impassioned plea to the jury Wednesday as the high-profile case neared its conclusion. Knox is the American student accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, at the villa they shared in Italy. \\"We suffer at the memory of Meredith. But we look at the future of Amanda,\\" Luciano Ghirga said in his defense summation. \\"Meredith was my friend,\\" he quoted Knox as saying, rejecting the notion that she hated her roommate, who was fatally stabbed in November 2007. Prosecutors say Kercher died during a twisted sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher, and two men -- Knox's then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, and acquaintance Rudy Guede -- sexually assaulted her. The prosecution says a knife found in Sollecito's house had Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade, among other pieces of evidence. But Ghirga rejected the accusations against Knox on Wednesday. He attacked the way police and prosecutors had treated the defendant, giving them a symbolic \\"red card\\" -- a referee's sign in soccer that a player is being expelled from the game for breaking the rules. Ghirga concluded an emotional oration -- sobbing as he came to the end -- by asking the judge and jury to acquit Knox, because her mother asked him to request it, because her family asked it. Knox's father, Curt, said Wednesday she had been a victim of \\"character assassination,\\" and expressed hope she would be found not guilty.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two entirely different topics. Let's break down each question to understand them better. 1. App to prepare for NEET Medical PG? This question is asking for suggestions on mobile applications that can help in preparing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG). NEET PG is an entrance examination in India for students who want to pursue postgraduate medical education (MD/MS) after completing their MBBS degree from a recognized medical college. There are several apps available that can aid students in their preparation for the NEET PG examination. Some popular ones include: a) Marrow: This app offers subject-wise tests, QBank, high-yield videos, and daily tests designed to achieve better scores in the NEET PG. It also has features like performance analysis and personalization based on the student's preparation needs. b) PrepLadder: This app provides video lectures by expert medical faculty, high-quality study material, and a question bank with explanations and video discussions. It also offers an extensive test series to practice time management and gauge performance. c) DAMS: One of the leading medical coaching institutes in India, DAMS provides eMedicoz, an app designed primarily for medical students preparing for NEET PG. It offers test series, video lectures, Q&A discussions, high-yield notes, and other useful content. 2. Should I exchange my new Nikkor 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens with its VR II version? This question is related to photography equipment, specifically Nikon lenses. The user is asking whether they should exchange their current Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens for the newer Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. The Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR and VR II lenses are both entry-level zoom lenses designed for Nikon DX-format DSLR cameras. The main differences between the two lenses are as follows: a) Size and Weight: The VR II version is slightly more compact and lighter than the original VR version. This may be a factor if you value portability in your camera gear. b) Optics and Image Quality: While both lenses have similar optical formulas, the VR II lens has been reported to have marginally better image quality and a slightly improved VR (Vibration Reduction) system. However, the difference is not significant, and many users may not notice any substantial improvement in image quality. Considering these differences, exchanging the Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens for its VR II version depends on personal preferences and requirements. If you find that the portability and marginal improvements in the VR II version are worthwhile, then an exchange may be a good idea. However, if you're happy with the performance of your current lens and do not see any pressing need for the upgrade, it might be better to stick with the original lens. In conclusion, these two questions inquire about entirely different topics - one is related to medical exam preparation applications, while the other is about photography equipment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals. The answer is:","completion":"Magma forms deep beneath the Earth's crust. Step-wise justification: 1. We need to consider the direction of the process given, which starts with magma cooling. This leads us naturally to the step right before that: the creation or formation of the magma. 2. Magma is an extremely hot liquid or semi-fluid material that is found beneath the earth's surface. Its formation primarily occurs in the mantle, the layer between the Earth's crust and its core, due to tectonic activity or certain geological processes. Therefore, it's legitimate to consider \\"Magma forms deep beneath the Earth's crust\\" as the missing first step. 3. After the formation of magma, the next step in the process is its cooling, which fits perfectly as the step after the proposed missing first step. 4. After cooling, the particles in the magma move closer together, forming crystals that contain various minerals. This shows how the process from the formation of magma to the creation of mineral-containing crystals is continuous and consistent with geological knowledge.

Answer the question about text: fallen fences and wild trees . we watch sunset and ate a few tree ripened mangoes . in 2 weeks there will be tonnes of bowen , nam dok mai , kp and elephant tusk mangoes just splotting on the ground below . Where may we be staying ?","completion":"Based on the text provided, it appears that we may be staying in a rural or semi-rural area that has an abundance of mango trees, specifically the Bowen, Nam Dok Mai, KP, and Elephant Tusk varieties. These regions are typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where mango trees thrive. Considering the information, it is likely that we are in a country or area like India, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia or South America, given the popularity of these mango varieties in these regions. Here is a more detailed analysis: 1. Bowen (also known as Kensington Pride or KP) is a popular mango variety originally from Australia that has gained popularity in various parts of the world, including India and Southeast Asia. This suggests that we might be in Australia or a nearby tropical location. 2. Nam Dok Mai is a popular mango variety native to Thailand, recognized for its sweet and juicy flesh. This variety is popular across Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and the Philippines. Based on the presence of Nam Dok Mai mangoes, we might be in Thailand or its neighboring countries. 3. Elephant Tusk, also known as Mattu Gulla or Kilichundan in local languages, is a variety of Indian mango that has elongated shape and obtains its name due to its resemblance to an elephant's tusk. Based on the presence of this variety, we might be in India or its surrounding countries, where this unique mango variety is found. Taking all these factors into consideration, it's likely that we may be staying in a rural or semi-rural region in a tropical or subtropical climate. The area could be in or around India, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, or a neighboring country where these specific mango varieties are commonly grown. It is worth mentioning that we are possibly in a less urban and more natural setting, as indicated by the description of 'fallen fences', 'wild trees', and enjoying the sunset, which suggests a more idyllic and less developed location."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). After reading the above, is \\"The Great Teacher\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who's influence was so profound that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to his birthplace?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"The Great Teacher\\" refers to Confucius, whose influence was so profound that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to his birthplace. Confucius, also known as Kongfuzi or K'ung Fu-tzu, was a highly influential philosopher and teacher in ancient China. He established the philosophical and moral framework that has significantly shaped Chinese culture and society throughout history. His teachings emphasized the importance of harmonious relationships, proper conduct, and hierarchical order in creating a stable and prosperous society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hazard's first-half finish gave Jose Mourinho's side three points and means that victory in forthcoming games at Arsenal and Leicester City will return the title to Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2010. Chelsea were pushed all the way by a resurgent United, hunting a seventh successive Premier League victory. Wayne Rooney and the recalled Radamel Falcao came closest for United but once again they fell victim to the resilience and defensive strength that is Chelsea's trademark under Mourinho, assisted by the brilliance of Hazard, and ended frustrated. The reaction of Chelsea's players as referee Mike Dean sounded the final whistle, celebrating wildly in front of their supporters, suggested they believed this was the victory that has pushed them to the brink of glory, as they moved 10 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal. And now, even if they do not wrap it up in these next two games, surely nothing can stop Mourinho winning the title in his second season after coming back to Stamford Bridge. As for United, this defeat may have ended their recent winning streak but they once again produced compelling evidence that they are now a very different proposition from the side that struggled, even though they were grinding out results, earlier this season. Manager Louis van Gaal, as expected, had to reshuffle his side after ruling out Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind through injury. Ander Herrera was utilised in the anchor role vacated by Carrick and Rooney was pushed into midfield - but United were still able to make the more impressive start and should have taken an early lead. Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney looked a certain scorer when he raced on to Luke Shaw's cross but placed his finish inches wide, so close that goalkeeper David de Gea joined United's fans in celebrating a goal until they realised after several seconds that the effort was off target. Herrera was prominent as United looked the better side but, as ever, Chelsea were rock solid and resilient and took the first chance that came their way seven minutes before the break. Falcao, given a rare start, was easily bundled off the ball by John Terry and when Oscar played in Hazard with a clever backheel he applied a cool finish between De Gea's legs. Van Gaal protested furiously to fourth official Craig Pawson that Falcao had been fouled but to no avail. Chelsea almost doubled their lead early in the second half when Didier Drogba's shot was deflected over De Gea but Hazard could only turn the loose ball against the upright from an angle as he tried to complete the job at the far post. United's recent improvement was underlined as they continued to take the game to Chelsea, keeper Thibaut Courtois blocking Paddy McNair's 20-yard shot and Oscar deflecting Rooney's precise effort inches wide. Van Gaal introduced Angel Di Maria and Adnan Januzaj for Juan Mata and Ashley Young as they continued to carry the fight to Chelsea, who seemed content to protect their lead and hit on the break. Falcao had worked hard but it had been another fruitless game and his frustration continued with 12 minutes left when he escaped from Kurt Zouma to collect Shaw's pass only to strike the outside of the post from a tight angle. There was one last alarm for Chelsea when Herrera was cautioned for tumbling under Gary Cahill's challenge in the penalty area - and the scenes at the conclusion of an enthralling contest reflected the importance of this win.

Meaning : When I explained to her that I'm attached to a woman instead of a man, she had doubts, and posed many questions about my parents' reaction and whether I was sad or not, because I would never be able to give birth children. Step 3: Translation of the Arabic text into Hebrew, whilst maintaining the essence of the original text. The translated text should smoothly communicate the meaning to someone who speaks Hebrew, while being as accurate and faithful to the original text as possible. Hebrew Sentence : כאשר הסברתי לה שאני מחוברת לאישה ולא לגבר, היא התמלאה בספקות, ושאלה הרבה שאלות לגבי התגובה של ההורים שלי והאם אני עצובה או לא, מאחר ואני לעולם לא אוכל להיות ממשמשת ילדים. I used my understanding of the languages' grammars and vocabularies to translate the Arabic sentence. I also aimed for the Hebrew translation to be fluent, clear, and easy to read, reflecting the Arabic original's syntax and semantics as closely as possible. I placed words in the correct order for the Hebrew language and chose words that best captured the Arabic sentence's meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Choices: a). No; b). Yes; Answer:","completion":"a). No; The suggested answer does not comprehensively explain how a fire extinguisher works. It only talks about the gases used in certain types of extinguishers. A complete explanation of how a fire extinguisher works should mention that fire extinguishers work on the principle of removing one or more of the three elements necessary to sustain a fire: heat, fuel, and oxygen. When you trigger the extinguisher, it releases a substance—generally either water, foam, dry chemical, or a gas like carbon dioxide—that's designed to put out the fire. In particular, the extinguishing substance either cools the burning material, starves the fire of fuel, or removes oxygen. The main parts of a fire extinguisher include the container, a handle/lever, a safety pin and seal, an extinguishing agent, and a pressure gauge. The extinguisher works when you pull the safety pin and squeeze the handle. The handle presses a rod which opens a valve allowing the extinguishing agent to escape through a nozzle or short hose at high speed. By pointing this at the fire, one can put the fire out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Richmond, Virginia: In 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Honorable Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.

Process: - You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs - The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less leaves fall on the ground happens, how will it affect the area of the windpipe is decreased. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided - \\"less leaves fall on the ground\\" - doesn't have a direct or obvious indirect effect on the process of breathing or on the size of a person's windpipe. The process of breathing consists of the following steps: 1. Inhaling oxygen through the nose or mouth. 2. Oxygen travels down the windpipe (trachea) and enters the lungs. 3. Oxygen moves from the small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs into the bloodstream. 4. Carbon dioxide in the blood moves into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. 5. Exhaling carbon dioxide through the nose or mouth into the environment. Leaves falling on the ground is an unrelated natural occurrence, primarily involving plants and trees shedding their leaves, typically during autumn or due to changing environmental conditions. It doesn't have a direct impact on the function or size of a person's windpipe, nor does it adversely affect the process of breathing. Indirectly, there may be instances where an excessive accumulation of leaves could affect air quality, such as a large pile of rotting leaves producing mold and emitting unpleasant odors. In this case, the air quality might influence a person's breathing experience or potentially exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions, but it still wouldn't directly impact the area of the windpipe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued .

This is because the information given indicates that crocodiles have lived in the region since biblical times, which would be considered part of recorded history. It is true that the recent importation of crocodiles from the Florida Everglades suggests that there might have been a period when the presence of crocodiles decreased or disappeared in the region. However, we do not have enough information to support the claim that there were absolutely no crocodiles living in the region at various points in recorded history. Additionally, the fact that crocodiles have been living in the region since biblical times indicates that the region's natural environment likely supported their presence. Crocodiles may have coexisted with the human populations in this region, possibly entering into local cultural and religious beliefs as well as impacting the ecosystem. Given that crocodiles have a significant history of living in the region in question, it is not accurate to say that they have never lived there throughout recorded history.

ADVERTISEMENT Multiple protesters interrupted House floor debate on the tax bill Tuesday, including people who shouted \\"kill the bill, don't kill us!\\" as well as a woman in a wheelchair who said she relies on Medicaid and warned that the bill would \\"starve\\" the public.

This is their money, after all,\\" Ryan said. A woman in the public visitors gallery then shouted, \\"You're lying!\\" Tax reform has long been a top priority for Ryan and other congressional Republicans, who view it as necessary to improve business competitiveness and boost economic growth. Trump also promised large tax cuts on the campaign trail and in his first months in office. Republicans view the tax overhaul as critical to maintaining their congressional majorities in 2018, after they failed this year to fulfill their seven-year pledge to repeal ObamaCare. The first overhaul of the tax code since 1986 sped through Congress at a rapid pace, from House Republicans first unveiling a bill in early November to passing a final bicameral compromise a month later. By contrast, the 1986 tax-reform effort had bipartisan support and didn’t reach then-President Reagan’s desk until nearly a year after it was first introduced in the House. Public polling on the GOP’s tax overhaul indicates support hovering at less than 30 percent, which is even lower than the favorability toward ObamaCare when Democrats passed it in 2010. Republicans have battled the perception their plan primarily benefits corporations and the wealthy, even though many middle-class taxpayers will get at least a modest tax cut. But GOP lawmakers insist people will come to appreciate the changes made by the tax overhaul over time. “When they get another 100 to 150 a month, by February when the new brackets come out, they’re going to say, ‘Honey! [Senate Minority Leader Charles] Schumer [D-N.Y.] was lying to me! [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi [D-Calif.] was lying!

I got more money!’ ” said Rep. Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsGOP lawmakers back discharge petition to force immigration votes GOP in retreat on ObamaCare Obstacles for Trump in push to expand the death penalty MORE (R-N.Y.). The final tax bill involved lawmakers making some concessions from their original wish lists, but achieves the goals of cutting taxes across the board and making the U.S. corporate tax system more in line with the systems in other countries. The bill lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates a 20-percent deduction for income of pass-through businesses that pay taxes through the individual code. It increases the exemption amounts for the individual alternative minimum tax and estate tax, and it moves the U.S. to a territorial tax system that generally exempts U.S. companies’ foreign earnings from U.S. taxes. Additionally, the bill effectively repeals ObamaCare’s individual mandate that requires people to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, and it allows for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — two top priorities for many Republicans. In order to comply with budget rules that allow the Senate to pass the bill with a simple-majority vote, most of the tax cuts for individuals expire after eight years while the corporate tax cuts are permanent. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that income groups across the board would on average get a tax cut in 2019. But in 2027, after the individual cuts are set to expire, income groups under 75,000 would on average see their taxes go up. Republicans say they expect the temporary tax cuts will be extended. The committee also estimated the bill would add 1.46 trillion to the debt over 10 years. The House Republicans who voted against the bill were mostly lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who were troubled by the bill’s 10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction. Rep.

In an early morning tweet Tuesday, Trump savors what would be his biggest legislative accomplishment as president, and says \\"DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\" He also says, \\"Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size.\\" The president adds, \\"Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy. And create many beautiful JOBS!\\" ___ 3:55 a.m. Their long-sought political goal within grasp, Republicans in Congress are set to catapult sweeping 1.5 trillion tax legislation through the House, rolling over a dozen GOP defectors from high-tax states. The Republicans' final drive to deliver the tax package to an eager President Donald Trump begins Tuesday with a vote in the House. Quickly following, a vote later in the day or on Wednesday in the Senate is expected to seal the deal. Both tallies likely will cling along party lines. The Senate result was in doubt in recent weeks. Only on Friday did Republican leaders cement the needed support for the legislation, securing endorsements from wavering GOP senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Corker of Tennessee. More holdout GOP senators— moderate Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Lee of Utah — came into the fold on Monday. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The U.S. Congress is voting on a big tax bill that can change how much money people and businesses have to pay in taxes. The Republican party, which supports the bill, says it will help businesses and people keep more of their money. The Democratic party, which opposes the bill, says it mostly helps rich people and big companies. If the bill passes, it will be the first major law approved by Congress in President Trump's time in office. The vote is expected to be very close, but if it passes through both parts of Congress, it will go to President Trump to sign it and make it a law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: 4.3.2.1 Movie plot: The story focuses on four 19-year-old friends: Joanne, Cassandra, Shannon and Kerrys. They all meet one other at a diner, where they see Dillon and Smoothy. Unbeknownst to Dillon, Shannon has a crush on him. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home. First, the story focuses on Shannon: she walks into her home just as her mother is leaving her father. She loses her temper and runs away, going to Jo's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Jo calls Shannon over to the supermarket where she works, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, whom he asked out earlier in the day, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away. After getting drunk at a bar, she goes to a tunnel where she sprays graffiti on the wall, is attacked by a gang and then taken in by Kelly, who saved her. Shannon realizes that Kelly seems to be looking for the Pringles. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for \\"15 diamonds\\". One is already in Cassandra's bag and the rest are in the can that fell out of Shannon's bag in the tunnel. She escapes by knocking Kelly out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to where she was attacked, and leaves a message informing Jo about them. Later, Shannon tracks down her mother and accuses her of not caring about her, especially when she forced her to get an abortion. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to commit suicide. Jo, Cassandra and Kerrys appear to threaten Shannon into handing the diamonds over.

Summarize this article: The Scottish Conservative leader, who is gay, plans to marry her partner in the near future. The DUP opposes same-sex marriage, with Northern Ireland the only part of the UK where it is not legal. Ms Davidson said she had been given an assurance that gay rights would not be eroded in return for DUP support. In a tweet sent on Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson highlighted a speech she made in Belfast about the importance of equal marriage. She told the BBC's Reporting Scotland programme that she had spoken about the issue with Theresa May on Friday evening. Ms Davidson said: \\"I was fairly straightforward with her and I told her that there were a number of things that count to me more than party. \\"One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights.\\" The Scottish Tory leader said she had asked for, and received, a \\"categoric assurance\\" from Mrs May that any arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP would see \\"absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK\\". And she said the prime minister agreed to try to use her influence to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland. Ms May, whose party lost its majority at Westminster in Thursday's general election, says she will put together a minority government with the support of the DUP to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. The DUP, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong and controversial views on a number of social issues. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - with abortion remaining illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP \\"friends\\" to \\"get to work\\" on Brexit. She referred to the \\"strong relationship\\" she had with the DUP, but gave little detail of how their arrangement might work. It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it \\"lend\\" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as \\"confidence and supply\\". When asked whether she was comfortable about the arrangement given the DUP's views, Ms Davidson said there was \\"no suggestion\\" that the Conservative government would be dependent on the support of the DUP. She added: \\"The prime minister has already made it clear that it is not going to be a formal coalition, so let's see how the future days go ahead.\\" Ms Davidson, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, has called for the Tories to listen to other parties to deliver an \\"open Brexit\\", which she defines as ensuring that free trade is at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. She said: \\"I want to make sure that Scottish businesses can trade as freely as possible with the other 27 countries in the EU as well as the other countries around the world.\\" Ms Davidson's party won 13 seats in Scotland as its vote surged across the country. Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned seven and four MPs respectively, with the SNP winning 35 - a drop of 21 from the 56 the party won two years ago. The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations.

Context: In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \\"Wireless\\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

Please answer the following question: Riding a bike does not cause pollution, and bikes are good for exercise and produce no pollution. Given these facts, what can you ride to get good exercise and avoid producing harmful gases among the following options: - cows - bike - stairmaster - cycles - bus - trolley - Lift - goats Answer:","completion":"Out of the options provided, riding a bike and using cycles are the most suitable means of getting good exercise while avoiding the production of harmful gases. Both bikes and cycles are human-powered modes of transportation, which makes them eco-friendly and sustainable. There are several reasons why these two options stand out when compared to the others: 1. Bikes and cycles: - Provide an excellent cardiovascular workout: Cycling helps strengthen your heart muscles, lower your resting pulse, and reduce blood fat levels, contributing to overall cardiovascular fitness. - Improve muscle strength and flexibility: This activity works on your leg muscles, particularly the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, leading to increased strength and flexibility in these muscle groups. - Aid weight loss and maintenance: Cycling burns calories effectively, resulting in weight loss if combined with a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. Since it is easy on the joints, it can be a preferred choice for those looking to lose weight healthily. - Reduce stress and anxiety: Cycling can improve mental well-being by releasing endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. It also helps to ease stress and anxiety by offering a relaxing way to enjoy the outdoors and escape the pressures of everyday life. - Promote better lung health: Cycling encourages deep breathing, which helps in increasing the capacity of your lungs and keeps them healthy. - Contribute to a greener environment: As cycling does not emit any harmful gases, it significantly reduces air pollution and contributes to a healthier environment. 2. Comparing other options: - Cows and goats: Although riding cows and goats might seem like an interesting idea, it is quite impractical. These animals are not designed to carry human weight for long durations, and the stress on the animal could lead to adverse health effects. Additionally, these animals are not widely available for riding purposes in urban and suburban settings. - Stairmaster: While a stairmaster can provide a good workout, it is an indoor gym equipment and does not offer the same environmental benefits as biking does. It might consume electricity, contributing to the energy used by the gym. - Bus and trolley: These are forms of public transportation that produce pollution. Although they are better alternatives to driving individual cars, they are not suitable for achieving personal fitness, as users are passively transported and do not engage in physical activity. - Lift: A lift, or elevator, is not suitable for exercise and also consumes electricity. In contrast, taking the stairs instead of using a lift can provide some form of physical activity. In conclusion, among the given options, riding a bike or using cycles is the most effective and environmentally friendly way to get good exercise and avoid producing harmful gases. These modes of transportation not only help in maintaining personal health and fitness but also contribute to the well-being of our environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the character who is threatened after he causes a disturbance? is inside the article: During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon. Laurel unintentionally \\"razzes\\" the warden and their exit from the prison has to be a very fast one., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the character who is threatened after causing a disturbance in the article is Stan Laurel, who is a part of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy.

The Mafia presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Given the context provided, organized crime did not fall in New York City within the 20th century. It is apparent from the passage that organized crime has been a significant issue in New York City, going back as far as the 1820s with the groups known as the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points area. It indicates that the 20th century saw an upsurge in organized crime, particularly involving the Mafia. The context highlights that during the 20th century, the Mafia, dominated by the five leading or notable families, saw a rising influence, as well as other gangs such as the Black Spades. The Five Families, known to be at the core of the American Mafia, were powerful Italian-American crime families that leveraged their power through organized crime to control economic and political activities. The five families were the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese families. What's clear from this passage is that organized crime did not decrease or fall in the 20th century in New York City, but rather significantly increased. Gangs became more structured and exerted stronghold over different sections of the city. The Mafia's influence stretched across numerous sectors, from local businesses, drug trafficking, and racketeering, to high-profile economic areas, impacting the city's socio-economic structure. However, the situation began to change over the course of the 21st century. The text mentions that the Mafia's presence in the city saw a decline during the early part of this century. Although it doesn't elaborate on the reasons behind this, possible explanations could be enforcement of tougher laws, increased penalties for organized crime, better law enforcement strategies, and greater emphasis on tackling organized crime at multiple levels by the city’s law enforcement agencies. Despite this, one can infer that the effects of organized crime are still felt to an extent in the present age. Therefore, with respect to the original question, the 20th century was a period when organized crime did not fall, but rather augmented in New York City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where does Bond follow Jinx into ? Movie title: Die Another Day Movie plot: MI6 officer James Bondâagent 007âinfiltrates a North Korean military base, where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African blood diamonds. After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, which ends with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After 14 months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in Cuba. In Havana Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but Zao escapes. He leaves behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves.

A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as \\"the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them\\", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said \\"For the sake of their own pride, they [the Vietnamese officers] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?\\" However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said \\"Because this is one of the happiest days of my life ...

Passage: At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan appeared at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands; for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries, to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed that they should be broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.Meanwhile, the police located the embassy caretaker and took him to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

Go swimming: Like biking, this is also a physical activity that will use more energy instead of providing it. 3.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

She sees them and gets this huge smile on her face and tells me to \\"watch this.\\" She starts rolling her window down and starts opening up her water bottle. At this point I'm pretty sure she's going to douse them with water in frigid temperatures. I tell her not to do it, but as we drive by them she flings the water out of her water bottle all over them and laughs and gives me the biggest shit eating grin. I was fucking pissed, because I'm pretty sure what she just did could be considered assault and if they got my liscense plate I could be liable. So I pulled over about 100 yards past her victims (they could still see us) and told her to get the fuck out of my car. She looked at me shocked like she did nothing wrong and refused. I reached across and opened the car door, and then unbuckled her seatbelt and told her to get the fuck out of my car again. Again she wouldn't and told me to just drive her home. So I pushed her out of the car, drove forward a little bit so she couldn't scramble back in, and tossed her purse out a little further up. And then I drove off and left her on the side of the road. Obviously she blew up my phone calling me an asshole, and its needless to say that whatever this relationship was it's over at this point.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"reproduction\\", given that photosynthesis means plants convert from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates for themselves? Pick your answer from: [1]. Yes [2]. No Answer:","completion":"Answer: [2]. No Photosynthesis is a process that allows plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. To answer the given question, let's consider the details of this process and why the answer \\"reproduction\\" is incorrect. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water (H2O) from their roots. They use light energy from the sun to power a series of chemical reactions that convert these reactants into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). This process can be summarized by the following equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis isn't simply beneficial for the individual plant; it is also crucial for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and the energy we consume via the food chain. Additionally, it helps regulate global levels of carbon dioxide, which is an essential factor in addressing climate change. Reproduction, on the other hand, is a biological process through which new offspring are produced by an organism. In plants, reproduction can occur via sexual reproduction, involving the formation of seeds and pollination, or asexual reproduction, such as producing new plants through vegetative propagation. It plays a vital role in maintaining genetic diversity and ensuring the continuation of species, but it is not directly related to the photosynthetic process of converting CO2, water, and light energy into carbohydrates. Given the definition and function of photosynthesis, it is clear that the right answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is not \\"reproduction.\\" Instead, the answer should reflect the process through which plants use light energy to produce carbohydrates, such as \\"the process in which plants convert CO2, water, and solar energy into glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His demise, resulting from smoke inhalation and thermal burns, has earned him a place amongst the latest entrants for the Darwin Awards. The bizarre incident occurred on a Saturday, when Caldwell seemingly got stuck in the chimney of the house he was allegedly trying to break into. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office reported that the homeowner had been away and returned to the home that same day. It is believed that Caldwell tried to enter the house overnight on Friday and became lodged in the chimney. Unaware of Caldwell’s presence, the homeowner lit a fire in the fireplace around 3 pm. Upon hearing someone yell, the startled homeowner immediately tried to put the fire out as the house began to fill with smoke. The homeowner then promptly called 911, with the man seemingly moving and breathing roughly ten minutes after the call was placed. Fresno County rescuers responded to the situation with urgency, using jackhammers to dismantle the Huron home's chimney in an attempt to save Caldwell. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, Caldwell was declared dead at the scene. Cody Caldwell's identity was confirmed on Sunday night by the Fresno Bee. Such an incident has shocked and surprised local authorities, as Fresno County Sheriff's Deputy Jake Jensen attests: \\"I've been a deputy for almost 17 years now, and I've never seen anything like this.

In addition to the shattered chimney, Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Pursell told the Bee that the Huron home suffered smoke damage, highlighting the unfortunate and unforeseen consequences of Caldwell's alleged actions. This peculiar case serves as a reminder of the importance of considering the potential risks and consequences of one’s decisions.

Widow Peep refuses, but is worried about where she'll get the money to pay the mortgage. Ollie offers her all the money he has stored away in his savings can, only to learn that Stannie has taken it to buy peewees (a favored toy consisting of a wooden peg with tapered ends that rises in the air when struck with a stick near one end and is then caused to fly through the air by being struck again with the stick). He and Stannie set out to get the money for the mortgage from their boss, the Toymaker (William Burress). But Stannie has mixed up an order from Santa Claus (building 100 wooden soldiers at six feet tall, instead of 600 soldiers at one foot tall) and one of the soldiers, when activated, wrecks the toy shop. Stannie and Ollie are fired without getting the money. The two then hatch a plan to sneak into Barnaby's house and steal the mortgage, but are again foiled by their incompetence.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"He banned all of them\\" correctly answer the question \\"Contrast Tokugawa's attitude toward the British and Dutch traders and the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"He banned all of them\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Contrast Tokugawa's attitude toward the British and Dutch traders and the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.\\" Rather, a detailed and long answer should look like this: Ieyasu Tokugawa had different attitudes towards the British and Dutch traders compared to the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries. Initially, Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade and wanted silk. He found the Dutch and British traders favorable since they were non-proselytizing Protestants focused mainly on trading activities. Tokugawa saw them as good trade partners without interference in Japan's religious and cultural matters. On the other hand, Tokugawa had a negative perception of the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries. He believed that they were undermining traditional Japanese values by introducing and spreading Christianity in Japan. Due to his concerns about the influence of Christianity in Japan, he banned missionary activities in 1612 and later, in 1614, ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts who refused to renounce Christianity. This prompted a series of persecutions, leading to executions, torture, and forced renunciations. In the succeeding years, Tokugawa's government continued to impose isolationist policies to protect Japan from foreign influences. Japanese citizens were forbidden to travel abroad or return if they were already overseas, with the fear of them bringing back potentially subversive ideologies, particularly Christian doctrines. Western and certain Chinese books that mentioned Christianity were also banned. Thus, while Tokugawa appreciated the trade benefits from his alliances with the British and Dutch, his primary concern was to preserve the country's cultural integrity and maintain political control by suppressing the growth of foreign religions, such as Christianity introduced by Portuguese and Spanish missionaries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: My Girl Context: The movie is set in Madison, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1972. Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is a 11-year-old girl and a hypochondriac. Vada's father, Harry Sultenfuss (Dan Aykroyd), is an awkward widower who does not seem to understand his daughter, and as a result, constantly ignores her. His profession as a funeral director, in which the Sultenfuss' residence is also a funeral parlor, has led Vada to develop an obsession with death as well as disease. Vada also thinks that she killed her own mother, since her mother died giving birth to her. She regularly tends to her invalid grandmother (Ann Nelson), who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Harry's brother Phil (Richard Masur), who lives nearby, also stops by frequently to help out the family.Vada is teased by other girls because her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), is unpopular and a boy. Their summer adventures from first kiss to last farewell introduce Vada to the world of adolescence.Vada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelley Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the new make-up artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance. She is also infatuated with her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne), and steals some money from Shelley's trailer to attend a summer writing class that he is teaching.But before long, things start to fall apart. Her father and Shelley start dating and get engaged, she cannot bring herself to tell her father that she has experienced her first menstrual cycle, Thomas J. dies from an allergic reaction to bee stings while looking for Vada's mood ring in the woods, and she finds out that Mr. Bixler is engaged to someone else.Vada's grief, however, manages to mend the rift between her and her father, she learns that she didn't kill her mom during childbirth (since her father tells her that things like mothers dying in childbirth just happen), and by the end of the movie, Vada has not only managed to deal with her pain and grief, but has also overcome some of her previous issues as well.","completion":"Thomas J.

He inherited the Gwalior gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya , but he was always open to adopting aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles .","completion":"While these two sentences convey very similar ideas, there are slight differences in their structure and the choice of words. Let's break down the sentences in detail to analyze their meanings: 1. \\"He inherited the Gwalior - Gharana and the Gandharva - Mahavidyalaya, but he was always open to taking aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles.\\" This sentence highlights that the person inherited two distinct aspects: the Gwalior Gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. The term \\"Gharana\\" refers to a particular tradition or style of Indian classical music, while \\"Gandharva Mahavidyalaya\\" is an institution that imparts training in Indian classical dance and music forms. The use of hyphen (-) in the terms can be interpreted as an emphasis on the distinction between these two aspects. Additionally, the word 'taking' implies that he actively borrowed or collected aesthetic features from other gharanas and styles. 2. \\"He inherited the Gwalior gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, but he was always open to adopting aesthetic features of other gharanas and styles.\\" This sentence uses the same terms as the previous one, but without the hyphens, indicating that the two aspects (Gwalior Gharana and Gandharva Mahavidyalaya) may still function as separate entities, but perhaps with a closely related connection. The term 'adopting,' as opposed to 'taking,' suggests that the person not only borrows or collects aesthetic features from other gharanas and styles but also possibly integrates and assimilates those features into their own musical approach or teachings, allowing their style to evolve. In summary, these two sentences convey a slightly different emphasis in their word choices and punctuation, which may lead to a subtle variation in their meanings. However, in the broader context, both sentences put forth the idea that the person inherited the Gwalior Gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya while remaining open to the aesthetic elements of other gharanas and styles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be.

Let's take a deeper look at the details and discrepancies between the two sentences. Sentence 1: On Victory Road, they introduced their new manager, the Voodoo Queen, Roxxi Laveaux, to embarrass Christy Hemme. In this sentence, the context is that at an event referred to as Victory Road, there is an introduction of a new manager named 'the Voodoo Queen.' This new manager, 'the Voodoo Queen', is also identified as Roxxi Laveaux. The purpose of this introduction is to embarrass an individual named Christy Hemme. In this situation, Roxxi Laveaux is in a position of authority as the new manager, and Christy Hemme is the one targeted for embarrassment. Sentence 2: At Victory Road, they introduced their new manager, the Voodoo Queen, Christy Hemme, to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux. In the second sentence, the setting remains the same: an event called Victory Road. However, this time, the new manager identified as 'the Voodoo Queen' is Christy Hemme, not Roxxi Laveaux. The purpose of this introduction in this sentence is to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux. The roles are essentially reversed; Christy Hemme assumes the authoritative managerial position and Roxxi Laveaux is the one being embarrassed. In conclusion, the two sentences present different situations in the same setting of Victory Road. The primary discrepancy lies in the roles and identities of Christy Hemme and Roxxi Laveaux. In Sentence 1, Roxxi Laveaux is the new manager aiming to embarrass Christy Hemme, while in Sentence 2, Christy Hemme is introduced as the new manager with the intention to embarrass Roxxi Laveaux.

Question: Information: - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements. - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

Police detectives McGreavy (Rod Steiger) and Angeli (Elliott Gould) come to Stevens' office to break the news. McGreavy bitterly resents the doctor from a previous case in which Stevens' testimony led to a cop killer being institutionalized rather than sent to prison.The patient's personal problems are in question until Stevens' secretary is also found brutally murdered. Stevens comes to realize that he is the murderer's target, while the two detectives treat him as their prime suspect.A widower, Stevens expresses concern to his physician brother-in-law about the cops' behavior. McGreavy in particular is so aggressive in his interrogations, Angeli reports him to a superior and gets McGreavy thrown off the case.A pair of men posing as doormen break into Stevens' apartment, armed with guns. Stevens holds them off until his brother-in-law and two paramedics arrive. Not trusting the cops, Stevens makes an emergency call to the hospital for help.Choosing a name out of the Yellow Pages at random, he hires an old, quirky private investigator named Morgens (Art Carney) who lives in a rundown apartment filled with clocks and cats.

The premise states that \\"The last stop on the DART is Bray, a seaside resort with a beach and amusement arcades.\\" This information gives us a clear understanding that Bray is situated as the final destination on the DART line, where individuals can enjoy the features and attractions of a seaside resort. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that \\"Bray is the first stop on the DART.\\" This statement contradicts the given premise, as it suggests that Bray serves as the starting point on the DART line, rather than the endpoint that the initial premise mentions. When evaluating whether a premise entails a hypothesis, it is crucial to consider whether the proposed hypothesis is a logical extension or a necessary consequence of the premise. In this case, the premise and hypothesis are not consistent. Instead, they present differing perspectives on Bray's location on the DART line.

Given the question: Given the below context: Every night on the tour to support their 2000 album Return of Saturn, No Doubt threw after-show parties where people danced to Jamaican dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \\"Hey Baby\\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \\"or find different words that inspire me.\\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the \\"initial spark\\" from when the songs were conceived.The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording \\"Detective\\". There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song \\"Underneath It All\\" in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band \\"spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music\\", according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track.

She was taken in by elderly Fuzzy (Henry Travers), and gave birth to Mickey (Jackie Kelk) in the back room of Fuzzy's bookstore at the age of fifteen. Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son. Now seven years old, Mickey skips school and does as he pleases. Meanwhile, Letty earns a living by entertaining buyers so they will give business to her friend Steve Karns. A milk truck driven by Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Trevor (Cary Grant) hits Mickey as he is rollerskating in the street. When Letty's lawyer, Adolphe, learns that Mal is the wealthy president of Amalgamated Dairies (out checking every aspect of his large business), he talks Letty into seizing the opportunity to make some money. They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney (Paul Harvey) produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns) have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives. Letty is not satisfied with this arrangement; she wants her son back. Adolph suggests she seduce Mal and blackmail him into giving her Mickey (as well as money) with a recording of their conversation.

Output:","completion":"This task is asking you to identify, understand and classify the correct information about a 'enantiomer', which is a term related to molecules in chemistry. There are five options provided and you need to classify each answer into a predefined category: '1', '2', '3', or '4'. Now let's understand each option and place it in its category: 1. Option 1 - \\"Very different in all its chemical and physical properties\\" Enantiomers of a molecule are not very different in all their chemical and physical properties. The two forms are identical in most ways except one: they are mirror-images of each other and hence, this statement is false. So, we're going to classify this as '4' because it is incorrect. 2. Option 2 - \\"Superimposed mirror images\\" This statement is accurate. Enantiomers are indeed chiral molecules that are mirror images of each other but not superposable. So we can classify this as '1', which stands for correct information. 3. Option 3 - \\"Distinguishable by their optical activity\\" This is also a true statement. Enantiomers can be distinguished by their optical activity because they rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, this answer will be classified as '1' as well. 4. Option 4 - \\"The result of the cyclization of a molecule in different positions\\" Enantiomers are not the result of cyclization of a molecule. They are a result of a chiral center in the molecule. This statement is false, so we can classify this as '4'. 5. Option 5- \\"Interconvertible without rupture of covalent bonds\\" This is typically false for enantiomers. Usually, to interconvert between enantiomers, you would need to break and reform bonds, specifically at the chiral center. Therefore, it is false and will be classified as '4'. The output of this task should be your classifications for each statement: 1-4, 2-1, 3-1, 4-4, 5-4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: Ochagavia is a popular meal in Chile.","completion":"No, we cannot draw the hypothesis that \\"Ochagavia is a popular meal in Chile\\" from the given context. Here's the reasoning, step by step: 1. The context states that Ochagavia is a genus of the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae. This means that Ochagavia is a group of plants belonging to a specific family and subfamily. 2. The genus is named for Sylvestris Ochagavia, the Chilean minister of education, indicating that the name comes from a historical figure, rather than any direct relation to food or meals. 3. The context highlights that Ochagavia is endemic to southern and central Chile, so it does grow in the region; however, there is no specific mention of it being used or consumed as a meal. 4. The context also mentions four accepted species within the Ochagavia genus, but no information is provided regarding their culinary use or popularity in Chile. Since there is no information in the context about Ochagavia being consumed or used in cuisine, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Ochagavia is a popular meal in Chile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification for this answer is as follows: Step 1: If less igneous rocks break down, there will be fewer sediments available for the formation of sedimentary rocks.

He sped off across the school field and out onto the walkway. However, all of his effort was useless because leaning on a fence were the three bullies. Jonathan thought about crossing the street next to him, but it would be too risky. So he hid behind a small bush in hope that the three would leave. But he moved too quickly and was seen by one of the bullies. They approached him then. One bully grabbed Jonathan by the collar of his shirt and grabbed the money out of Jonathan's pocket and put it into his own. \\"G-Give it back\\", Jonathan weakly said. \\"G-G-Give it b-back\\", mocked the bully.

Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. Question: What is the main cause mentioned in the article why people suffer from a lot of new sicknesses? Answer: A:","completion":"The main cause mentioned in the article for people suffering from a lot of new sicknesses, also referred to as \\"diseases of civilization,\\" is the drastic shift in diet and lifestyle compared to what our ancestors experienced more than 10,000 years ago. The human body has changed very little since its first appearance, but the way we live, including our diets, has undergone significant changes. The consumption of fatty, salty, and sweet foods has increased, along with the intake of dairy products and grain-based foods. Additionally, people nowadays use more alcohol and tobacco and engage in less physical activity. These changes have led to health issues such as cancers, heart attacks, and strokes, which were not prevalent in ancient times. Scientists suggest that adopting a dietary and lifestyle approach similar to that of our ancient ancestors could lead to improved health and reduced risks of these modern diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The products I’ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*. Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash – the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth. The ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages. Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner – I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn’t say they smell of carrots!

I laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family. The movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--I'll bet they had a good old time while making it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great--and how about those Everly sisters, each of the two Falco's, and the divine music throughout. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his \\"My Way\\" welcome home to Vick performance. I am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie--it's a joke--not a terrifying \\"gangsta\\" film.

The premise is \\"Men in traditional Scottish attire marching and playing bagpipes.\\" Based on this statement, there are several details described: 1. Men are involved in the scene. 2. They are wearing traditional Scottish attire. 3. They are marching. 4. They are playing bagpipes. The hypothesis, \\"Bagpipe players are marching in the band,\\" is a reasonable assertion given the premise as it aligns with the provided information. Since bagpipes are being played in the given context, it signifies that there are bagpipe players involved. Additionally, the premise mentions that these men are marching, which is a characteristic of a typical band configuration, particularly in parades, ceremonial events, or other similar settings.

On Thursday... (Associated Press) The answer, experts say, is because Emory University Hospital is one of the safest places in the world to treat someone with Ebola. There's virtually no chance the virus can spread from the hospital's super-secure isolation unit. And another thing, they say: medical workers risking their lives overseas deserve the best treatment they can get. Dr. Kent Brantly became the first person infected with Ebola to be brought to the United States from Africa. He arrived Saturday at one of the nation's best hospitals. Fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol was expected to arrive in several days. \\"I hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill Americans return to the U.S. for care,\\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His agency received \\"nasty emails\\" and at least 100 calls from people questioning why the sick aid workers should be let into the United States. Despite the calls and messages directed to the CDC, few of those nearest the hospital Saturday seemed concerned. \\"I just think it's a blessing that we can help possibly make the infected person's life a little more tolerable,\\" said Ashley Wheeler, who was shopping just down the street on Saturday. \\"If I were that person I would want my country to help me the best way they could.\\" Emory's infectious diseases' unit was created 12 years ago to handle doctors who get sick at the CDC. It is one of about four in the country equipped with everything necessary to test, treat and contain people exposed to very dangerous viruses. In 2005, it handled patients with SARS, which unlike Ebola can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In fact, the nature of Ebola — which is spread by close contact with bodily fluids and blood — means that any modern hospital using standard, rigorous, infection-control measures should be able to handle it. Still, Emory won't be taking any chances. \\"Nothing comes out of this unit until it is non-infectious,\\" said Dr. Bruce Ribner, who will be treating the patients. \\"The bottom line is: We have an inordinate amount of safety associated with the care of this patient. And we do not believe that any health care worker, any other patient or any visitor to our facility is in any way at risk of acquiring this infection.\\" Ribner also said the patients deserve help. \\"They have gone over on a humanitarian mission, they have become infected through medical care and we feel that we have the environment and expertise to safely care for these patients and offer them the maximum opportunity for recovery from these infections,\\" he said Friday. Amber Brantly was heartened to see her husband climb out of the ambulance that met his plane at Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta. \\"It was a relief to welcome Kent home today. I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S.,\\" she said in a statement. \\"I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital.\\" Inside the unit, patients are sealed off from anyone who doesn't wear protective gear. \\"Negative air pressure\\" means air flows in, but can't escape until filters scrub any germs from patients. All laboratory testing is conducted within the unit, and workers are highly trained in infection control. Glass walls enable staff outside to safely observe patients, and there's a vestibule where workers suit up before entering. Any gear is safely disposed of or decontaminated. Family members will be kept at a distance for now, the doctors said. The unit \\"has a plate glass window and communication system, so they'll be as close as 1-2 inches from each other,\\" Ribner said. Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious disease specialist who will be treating Brantly and Writebol, gave no word Saturday about their condition. Both have been described as critically ill after treating Ebola patients at a missionary hospital in Liberia, one of four West African countries hit by the largest outbreak of the virus in history. There is no cure for the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever that kills as many as 60-80 percent of the people it infects in Africa. There are experimental treatments, but the missionary hospital had only enough for one person, and Brantly insisted that Writebol receive it. His best hope in Africa was a transfusion of blood including antibodies from one of his patients, a 14-year-old boy who survived thanks to the doctor. There was also only room on the plane for one patient at a time. Writebol will be next, following the same route to Emory in several days. ___ Medical Writers Mike Stobbe and Marilynn Marchione reported from New York and Milwaukee.

(Photo: Samaritan's Purse) A second American stricken with the Ebola virus is expected to return to the USA Tuesday, three days after a doctor being treated for the disease arrived at an Atlanta hospital for intensive care. Nancy Writebol, a medical missionary aiding in the treatment of Ebola victims in Liberia, is scheduled to leave that African nation around 1 a.m. Tuesday on a specially equipped medical evacuation plane, Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said, according to the Associated Press. Kent Brantly, the American doctor transported to Atlanta Saturday, \\"seems to be improving,\\" the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday. Brantly is being treated in a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after arriving Saturday at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia. It's the first time anyone infected with the deadly virus has been brought into the country. \\"We're hoping he'll continue to improve,\\" Dr. Tom Frieden told CBS' Face the Nation. \\"But Ebola is such a scary disease because it's so deadly. I can't predict the future for individual patients.\\" Brantly and Writebol were serving in Liberia as medical missionaries when they became infected with the virus, which has killed 729 people and sickened more than 1,300 the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Frieden has said his agency received \\"nasty\\" e-mails and at least 100 calls from people questioning why the sick aid workers should be let into the USA. Physicians are confident, however, that the two Americans can be treated without putting the public in danger. (Photo: AP) The virus is spread through direct contact with blood, urine, saliva and other bodily fluids from an infected person. It is not spread through the air. \\"I don't think it's in the cards that we would have widespread Ebola,\\" Frieden said. He said the virus spreads in African hospitals where there isn't infection control and in burial rituals where people touch the bodies of Ebola victims. That won't happen here, he said. \\"So it's not going to spread widely in the U.S. Could we have another person here, could we have a case or two? Not impossible,\\" Frieden said. \\"We say in medicine never say never. But we know how to stop it here. But to really protect ourselves, the single most important thing we can do is stop it at the source in Africa.

Writebol, of Charlotte, was working at the center on behalf of the faith group Service in Mission. Samaritan's Purse is paying for their evacuation and medical care. There's no specific treatment for Ebola so doctors try to ease symptoms, including fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Some victims suffer severe bleeding. Michael Stulman, a regional information officer in West and Central Africa for Catholic Relief Services, said Sunday that doctors and nurses there \\"are working in a particularly high-risk environment. They are typically are under-resourced. They're working 15- and even 20-hour days. Despite all their incredible efforts, sometimes mistakes happen and this is why we're seeing a fairly high number of Ebola-positive cases with nurses.\\" Treatment centers \\"are reaching full capacity soon after they are set up,\\" he said in an e-mail. \\"Some of the observation units are not fully staffed. The cross-border nature of the outbreak and the accessibility of transport to major towns have made this outbreak particularly difficult to contain.\\" Among the main challenges in containing the outbreak, he said, were several circulating myths, including one that said doctors at hospitals \\"will give you injections that kill you\\" instead of treating the illness. \\"As a result of these myths, some families who have sought care are discharging confirmed patients from the hospital and bringing them home before they are recovered. Other people who have Ebola never go to the hospital and instead choose to stay at home with their family, which puts their family at risk of contracting the disease when caring for them.\\" Contributing: WXIA-TV in Atlanta; Doug Stanglin; the Associated Press Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ngxCSh ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Ebola virus has killed many people in Africa and can be very dangerous.

The brothers collaborated closely on numerous compositions throughout their careers, creating some of the most memorable songs in the American songbook. \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" was one of their notable works, which has been recorded and covered by various artists over the years. The song was written in 1937 for the musical film \\"Shall We Dance,\\" where it was introduced by legendary performers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The music of the song was composed by George Gershwin, a prolific composer famous for his contributions to both American popular music and the classical repertoire. George's unique talent for combining jazz and classical elements made him a leading figure in the music world during the early 20th century. Meanwhile, the lyrics of \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" were crafted by Ira Gershwin, George's elder brother, and a renowned lyricist in his own right. Ira's impressive command of language and his ability to create witty, sophisticated, and heartfelt lyrics made him the perfect collaborator for his brother's music. Together, they produced numerous successful compositions that have stood the test of time. \\"You Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is a romantic ballad that captures the essence of two lovers reminiscing about their shared experiences and the enduring memories that have shaped their relationship. Even if the relationship were to end, as suggested by some interpretations, the lovers would still cherish the memories they've made together. The song's clever lyrics, combined with George Gershwin's expressive melody, create a sense of nostalgia and longing that resonates with listeners.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Choices: - growing older - reproducing - shuddering - perspiration - palpitations The rationale to choose \\"palpitations\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Palpitations can be indicative of potential health issues that may lead to a decreased lifespan if left untreated or unmanaged. While growing older is an inevitable part of life, and reproducing, shuddering, and perspiration are natural bodily functions that do not inherently signal a shortened life expectancy, palpitations are abnormal or irregular heartbeats that may be experienced as a fluttering, pounding, or racing sensation in the chest. They can be caused by several factors, including: 1. Heart conditions: Problems such as arrhythmias, heart valve disorders, or heart failure can lead to palpitations and potentially serious health consequences if not addressed. 2. Medical conditions: Palpitations may result from issues unrelated to the heart, such as thyroid disorders, low blood sugar, or dehydration. Some of these conditions left untreated can be life-threatening over time. 3. Stimulants and medications: Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and certain drugs can trigger palpitations. The misuse or overconsumption of such substances may contribute to a decreased lifespan. 4. Anxiety and stress: Prolonged stress can cause a strain on the heart and overall health, resulting in palpitations and an increased risk of developing more severe health issues. Although palpitations can be benign and may not necessarily indicate a life-threatening problem, they can also be a symptom of a serious underlying condition that requires medical attention. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if you experience frequent or severe palpitations, as addressing any potential health concerns early on can help prevent more serious complications and potentially extend your lifespan. In summary, while growing older is a natural aspect of life and not a sign of impending death in itself, palpitations could signify an underlying health condition or lifestyle factor that, if not addressed, may shorten your life expectancy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Roman architecture often incorporated the use of columns to support and embellish buildings, displaying stability, grandeur, and a sense of aesthetics. The other options listed do not represent types of buildings or might have columns but are not inherently known for their use of columns as a signature architectural component. - Whitehouse: The Whitehouse does have columns, but it's primarily known as the residence and workplace of the President of the United States, not for its use of columns as a defining architectural feature. - Pantheon: The Pantheon is a specific building in Rome, known for its grand columns, but it falls under the wider category of Roman architecture since it's a Roman temple. - Spreadsheet: A spreadsheet is not a type of building, but rather a digital document used for organizing, analyzing and storing data in a grid of horizontal rows and vertical columns. - Greece: Ancient Greek architecture did extensively use columns; however, the question specifically asked about buildings and not architectural styles or regions. Roman architecture is generally recognized for its extensive use of columns, particularly in large public structures like temples, basilicas, and amphitheaters. These columns followed several design orders such as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which they borrowed and adapted from the Greeks, adding their unique touch to create their Roman architectural identity.

Clinton has promised to release 2007 returns sometime after this year's April 15 income tax deadline, just a few days before Pennsylvania's April 22 primary. \\"Senator Clinton recently claimed that she's 'the most transparent figure in public life,' yet she's dragging her feet in releasing something as basic as her annual tax returns,\\" Obama's communications director, Robert Gibbs, said in a statement. \\"Senator Clinton can't claim to be vetted until she allows the public the opportunity to see her finances -- particularly with respect to any investment in tax shelters.\\" But Clinton made her own challenge to Obama during a press conference in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. \\"I am pleased that Senator Obama has released his tax returns. I think that's a good first step,\\" she said. \\"Now he should release his records from being in the state Senate and any other information that the public and the press need to know from his prior experience.\\" According to the 2006 return, Obama and his wife, Michelle, earned over 991,000 in 2006 and paid 277,431 on the income. More than half of the couple's income in 2006 -- nearly 507,000 -- came from royalties from his two books, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" and \\"Dreams From My Father.\\" In 2005, Obama earned over 1,210,000 from royalties, according to the couple's returns that year. The Obamas earned nearly 431,000 in wages in 2006, according to the returns. The documents do not show what Obama or his wife individually earned, but the senator's salary was 165,000 that year. They also earned more than 51,000 from Treehouse Foods, an Illinois-based food manufacturer. Michelle Obama served on Treehouse's board from June 2005 to May 2007. Before 2005, the couple had more modest incomes. Between 2000 and 2004, they earned between 207,647 and 275,123 a year. The returns were posted just minutes after the Clinton campaign attacked Obama for not releasing them. \\"In the public record, there are 20 years of Hillary's tax returns, hundreds of thousands of pages of records from her time in the White House and countless other documents detailing her time in public life. \\"Sen.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata? ? Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean.

Here is a list of colors, which can change your life. Blue/Purple Blue is considered to be peaceful and calming and it has the same effect on our health. The blue / purple color in food is due primarily to their anthocyanins which are antioxidants that are particularly heart healthy and may help support healthy blood pressure. Out of all the blue and purple foods available, blueberries are considered to have the highest antioxidant level. An analysis of the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study found that people who eat purple and blue fruits and vegetables are at a reduced risk for high blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight. A food and health expert says that blue and purple color foods can prevent blood mass formation, and they also lower the risk of cancer. Foods that contain blue and purple colors are: reddish eggplant (especially the skin), blueberries, blackberries, purple grapes, etc. Green We all know that we should eat green as green symbolizes nature. The green foods are rich in isothiocyanates, which help resist cancer. Dr. Ashok Agarwal, a food and nutrition specialist, explains, \\"They are excellent sources of folic acid, vitamin K, as well as carotene . Diets high in those above are associated with lowered blood pressure.\\" Foods that contain the green color are: broccoli, cabbage, cucumbers, etc. Red Lycopene in reddish fruits and vegetables is a powerful antioxidant that has been associated with a reduced risk of some cancers, and also provides protection against heart attacks. Dr. Smiths says, \\"Cooked tomato sauces are associated with greater health benefits as compared with the uncooked version as the heating process allows lycopene to be more easily absorbed by the body. Obtaining the most benefit from food depends on proper selection, storage and cooking of the produce.\\" Foods that contain red color are: Tomatoes and tomato products, watermelon,...

Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that 80 percent of all human illness are connected with diet and 40 percent of cancer is connected with the diet. Therefore, that food is connected with illness is not a new discovery. In 1940's scientists realized that nitrates , which are often used to keep color1 of meat, and other additives caused cancer. However these additives remain in our food and it becomes more difficult to know which additives are helpful or harmful.

With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel. Question: \\"Were the residents confident they could take on this fight on their own without legal and Political help?\\" Answer: \\"They state they were grateful and felt they could not have saved their homes without law help and the Mayor's help\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, this answer is correct. The residents acknowledged that they were unable to afford private legal counsel and sought help from the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. They also expressed their gratitude towards their lawyers, the Housing Authority, the City Council, and Mayor Steve Lacy for their assistance in resolving the situation. So, it is clear that they did not feel confident in taking on this fight without legal and political help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No While the suggested answer contains some accurate information, it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed response to the question \\"what caused WWI?\\" World War I, also known as the First World War, was a global war that occurred from 1914 to 1918. Multiple intertwined factors contributed to the outbreak of the conflict, including: 1. Militarism: The period leading up to the war saw a significant increase in military spending, technological advancements, and the development of strong armies and navies by many European powers. This arms race exacerbated tensions between nations and heightened the likelihood of war. 2. Alliances: The complex web of alliances between various nations across Europe made it difficult for diplomatic resolutions to be reached in the event of a conflict. The Triple Entente, an alliance between France, Russia, and Great Britain, and the Triple Alliance, an agreement between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, served as the framework for the two rival groups of countries during the war. 3. Imperialism: European powers were in fierce competition for control over territories and resources around the world, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Balkans. This competition for influence and colonial possessions contributed to an atmosphere of rivalry and distrust. 4. Nationalism: Nationalist movements and aspirations for independence were growing in strength within the multiethnic empires of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Russia. This fueled tensions within the empires and fed into the larger geopolitical rivalries. 5. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: The immediate catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. This event escalated into a broader conflict due to the aforementioned factors and the subsequent declarations of war between the nations involved. In conclusion, while the suggested answer touches upon the rivalries between Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and Russia, it lacks sufficient detail and context to provide a comprehensive understanding of the causes of World War I. Therefore, you should not validate this answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Etruscan civilization () is the modern name given to a powerful and wealthy civilization of ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio. As distinguished by its unique language, this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions (c. 700 BC) until its assimilation into the Roman Republic, beginning in the late 4th century BC with the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about 800 BC, approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the 7th century BC to a culture that was influenced by Ancient Greek culture. Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly consumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks. Around 540 BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites. In the 4th century BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happens after the alliance against the greek?","completion":"After the alliance against the Greeks, there was a battle called the Battle of Alalia around 540 BC. This battle led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Carthage expanded its influence, and the Etruscans became limited to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. This marked the beginning of the Etruscan decline as they started losing their southern provinces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few. Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). The answer is:","completion":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. The given information mentions that Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.

Story continuation: Rebecca is trusted by people a lot more than Samantha is because Rebecca is a truthful person. In their small town, everyone knew each other's strengths and weaknesses. Rebecca was well-regarded for her honest nature and ability to always speak the truth. No matter how hard it was, she stood by her principles and maintained her integrity. This earned her the respect of her peers and the trust of the town's residents. On the other hand, Samantha struggled with her reputation as someone who was not as truthful. While she was known to be friendly, she often embellished stories or avoided the truth to protect her image or stay out of any trouble. As a result, Samantha's words carried less weight, and people had a harder time trusting her. One day, a new family moved into the town, and they needed some guidance and support settling in. The townsfolk recommended Rebecca to help them, which allowed her to form a connection and share the values of their community, among which honesty was held in high regard. Samantha began to reflect on her actions and realized that her dishonesty had caused her to miss out on the chance to build authentic relationships and create a sense of belonging. Observing Rebecca's example, Samantha decided to make an effort to change her ways and learn to be more honest and trustworthy.

Q:Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. What would likely happen to Abduraheem back home? - he could be a pastor - he could secede from Sudan - he would have to fight or die - not enough information A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, if Abduraheem returns to Sudan, he would likely face continued persecution due to his work as a Christian pastor in a country where there has been an escalation in the government’s persecution of Christians. His previous arrest, detention, and mistreatment, including accusations of espionage, indicate a high risk of further difficulties and potential harm if he were to return to his home country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How many songs by Frank Sinatra were on the 1956 album called Hall of Fame, CL2600? Context: Eventually the 12-inch (300 mm) 33 1⁄3 rpm LP prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch LPs were no longer issued. The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10-inch LP record was an album called Hall of Fame, CL 2600, issued on October 26, 1956, containing six songs, one each by Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Johnnie Ray, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Frankie Laine. The 10-inch LP however had a longer life in the United Kingdom, where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury's The Sound of Fury were released in that form. The 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc or \\"single\\" established a significant niche for shorter duration discs, typically containing one item on each side. The 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs, while the 12-inch LP discs eventually provided up to one half-hour of recorded material per side.

A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the unaffiliated Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched. Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also tailed by two National Security Agency agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends with Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target. At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good. Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking about his work after all, flees the reunion.

Question: Who does Warsaw notice trying to get his attention from the crowd? Movie plot title: 15 Minutes Movie plot: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser.

A:","completion":"In the film '15 Minutes,' Warsaw, played by Edward Burns, notices Daphne Handlova trying to get his attention from the crowd. Daphne Handlova, portrayed by Vera Farmiga, is a Czech immigrant who is pivotal to the storyline because she witnessed a murder committed by Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul. She is an essential character in unraveling the truth behind the criminal activities of the duo - Emil and Oleg. After witnessing Emil stabbing their former partner and his wife to death, Daphne is marked as a target as well but manages to escape before they have a chance to kill her. Afraid for her life, she reaches out to Warsaw while he is checking out the crowd during his investigation of a crime scene, trying to bring the truth to light and probably seek his protection. When Warsaw spots Daphne in the crowd trying to get his attention, he tries to reach her to understand her urgency. However, by the time he arrives at her location, she has disappeared, enhancing the mysterious element in the plot line. This scene emphasizes not only the dangerous circumstances that Daphne is in but also highlights the dedicated character of Warsaw, an arson investigator working on this case. It also creates suspense as Daphne disappears before Warsaw can reach her, leaving the audience wondering what information she was trying to pass on and what might happen to her. Thus, by noticing Daphne in the crowd, Warsaw gets a clue about her existence and her potential connection to the crime he's investigating.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? The writers did so believe the boy.","completion":"To provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the given sentence, \\"The writers did so believe the boy,\\" first, we need to understand the basic components of a sentence, including word classes and their functions. The given sentence can be broken down into the following components: - \\"The writers\\" (noun phrase) is the subject of the sentence and represents the person or group of people performing the action conveyed by the verb. In this case, the noun phrase consists of a determiner \\"the\\" and a plural noun \\"writers.\\" - \\"did so believe\\" (verb phrase) is the predicate of the sentence which shows an action or a state of being. The predicate is composed of an auxiliary verb \\"did,\\" an adverb \\"so,\\" and the main verb \\"believe.\\" - \\"the boy\\" (noun phrase) is the object of the sentence, which is the person or thing affected by the action of the verb. It also consists of a determiner \\"the\\" and a noun \\"boy.\\" At a first glance, the sentence may seem grammatically awkward due to the unusual word order and the presence of the adverb \\"so\\" after \\"did.\\" However, there are contexts and scenarios where this construction can be considered grammatically correct. In the sentence, \\"did so\\" is an example of a \\"do-support,\\" which is used with the adverb \\"so\\" for emphasis or to provide a contrast. If the context is such that the writers are being compared to another group of people who did not believe the boy, the sentence can make sense and be considered correct. For example: \\"Unlike the skeptics, the writers did so believe the boy.\\" If we ignore the context provided by \\"unlike the skeptics,\\" the given sentence might appear more ambiguous or difficult to understand. However, it follows the basic structure of an English sentence (subject-predicate-object), employs correct syntax, and can be considered grammatically accurate depending on the context. So, would a linguist consider the sentence \\"The writers did so believe the boy\\" as correct? When evaluated strictly, a linguist might argue that its correctness is largely contingent upon the context. If the context provides clear evidence of emphasis or contrast concerning the writers' beliefs, this sentence can indeed be considered linguistically correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump's campaign is on damage control after one of the most damaging leaks in election history—but some commentators aren't sure if he'll be able to recover at all from the release of a 2005 \\"hot mic\\" tape in which he makes some very crude comments about women. The candidate is facing an almost unprecedented backlash from his own party, with some leading Republicans calling for him to step down as the nominee. A round-up of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan is one of scores of leading Republicans now trying to distance themselves from Trump, the Washington Post reports. He released a statement saying he is \\"sickened\\" by the comments—and Trump is no longer invited to a Wisconsin campaign event he was supposed to attend Saturday. CNN looks at how the old Access Hollywood tape made its way to the media at a very unfortunate time for Trump. Sources say a producer remembered the tape early in the week and, after digging it up mid-week, the show planned to air it Monday—but a copy made its way to the Washington Post first. CBS reports that Mike Pence has been refusing to answer reporters' questions about the tape. Reporters accompanying Pence were suddenly ushered out of a restaurant when the tape became public Friday. At a rally in Ohio that evening, Pence said that Trump emerges \\"still standing stronger than ever before\\" whenever he is targeted by the media. Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick tells the AP that he has been getting phone calls from donors who \\"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\\" He says a write-in campaign \\"could actually work,\\" although some states don't allow write-in candidates. The Los Angeles Times reports that even Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads a pro-Trump super PAC and had his hands full dealing with Hurricane Matthew, found the time to denounce Trump's comments. \\"I'm not following politics closely right now, but this is terrible,\\" he said. \\"I don't agree with anyone talking like this about anyone, ever.\\" The New York Times takes a look at what it calls \\"the apology that wasn't.\\" Sources say Trump huddled with advisers, including daughter Ivanka, before issuing the brief—and defiant apology—late Friday. The insiders say aides urged Trump not to mention the Clintons in the apology, but their advice was ignored. NBC News has statements from many of the Republicans who have condemned the remarks, including RNC chief Reince Priebus. \\"It's over,\\" a GOP strategist and Trump supporter tells the network. \\"Never seen anything like it. Never will.\\" People reports that Billy Bush, the co-host heard making lewd comments along with Trump, says he is \\"embarrassed and ashamed and is sorry for \\"playing along\\" with Trump. Trump tells the Washington Post he's staying in the race. “I’d never withdraw. I’ve never withdrawn in my life,” he says, citing \\"tremendous support.\\" Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, a man named Donald Trump wanted to become the president of the United States. He had a big election coming up, and his friends in his party – the Republicans – were supporting him. But, one day, a secret recording from many years ago was found, and it had Donald Trump saying mean and not-so-nice things about women. This made many people in his own party very upset and some even asked him to not try to become the president anymore. A man named Paul Ryan, who was an important leader in the Republican party, even stopped inviting Donald Trump to a big event. People couldn't stop talking about the secret recording. Some people who gave money to help his campaign wanted to use that money to support another person to be the Republican nominee. People like Mike Pence, Donald's friend, didn't want to talk about the secret recording too. Many important people in the Republican party said they didn't like what Donald Trump had said in that recording. Some of them thought that because of this, he wouldn't be able to win the big election. In the end, Donald Trump said he was sorry for what he said in that secret recording.

As they are pursued by a dangerous crime lord who has his eyes set on the same inheritance, the estranged siblings are forced to put their differences aside, building a connection beyond wealth and power while overcoming their own personal demons. Act 1: Michael, a former car racer, leads an unfulfilling life as a car mechanic in a small desert town. He's estranged from his siblings, Tina - a successful businesswoman, Billy - a grad school dropout now working as a bartender, and Jamie - a passionate environmental activist, due to a family feud and toxic family history. One day, they receive a mysterious letter from their long-lost grandfather, a wealthy businessman who'd been assumed dead for years. He bequeaths them with his multi-million dollar fortune but the twist is that they must participate in a cross-country car race to claim it. The rules state that they must embark on the journey together within 24 hours of receiving the letter and face multiple challenges and checkpoints along the way. Act 2: Michael, Tina, Jamie, and Billy begrudgingly agree to participate in the race, united by their desire for wealth and new beginnings. They gather at their childhood home, where they find their weapon for the journey, a beautifully restored classic car in the garage. As they set out on their journey, they realize they're not the only ones interested in the inheritance. A dangerous crime lord, Victor Marcone, aware of their mission, wants the fortune for himself and sends his henchmen to intercept the siblings and claim the money.

They realize that the race was their grandfather's way of bringing them back together. Michael decides to use his share of the inheritance to start a racing school for underprivileged kids, giving back to the community that built him. Tina, Jamie, and Billy also use their fortunes for good, fulfilling their lifelong dreams and making the world a better place.

However, when they are ingested, they can affect the body through a different route, which can eventually lead to their entrance into the bloodstream. When bacteria are ingested, they first encounter the harsh environment of the stomach, where stomach acid and other enzymes can kill or neutralize many bacteria. However, some bacteria can survive and move into the small intestine. Here, they can attach to the surface of the intestinal wall, multiplying and sometimes producing toxins or directly affecting the intestinal cells. Once the bacteria are established in the intestines, they can enter the bloodstream in various ways. This can happen when the bacteria directly invade the cells lining the intestines, when the bacteria release factors that cause the cells to break down, or when the bacteria stimulate an immune response, causing inflammation or damage to the intestinal lining. In all these cases, the bacteria have indirectly impacted the step of entering the bloodstream by first affecting the gastrointestinal system. The fact that they were ingested, and not directly entering the bloodstream from the skin, has led to an indirect route of infection.

Given the question: Information: - Internes Can't Take Money is a 1937 American drama film directed by Alfred Santell and starring Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Lloyd Nolan, and Stanley Ridges. McCrea portrays Dr. Kildare in the character's first screen appearance. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer continued the Dr. Kildare series with \\"Young Dr. Kildare\\" (1938) starring Lew Ayres as Kildare and Laraine Day as a nurse in love with Kildare, similar to Stanwyck's role in this film. The film was released in the United Kingdom as \\"You Can't Take Money\\". - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938 November 16, 2015) was an American actor, best known for his roles in \\"All My Children\\" and \\"Bonanza\\". - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The police procedural, or police crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that attempts to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation. - Rodman Edward \\"Rod\\" Serling (December 25, 1924 June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction anthology TV series, \\"The Twilight Zone\\".

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Leonard Freeman (October 31, 1920 January 20, 1974) was an American television writer and producer who is best remembered as the creator of the CBS series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" in 1968.

He appeared in a 1953 episode (#112) of the TV series, \\"The Lone Ranger\\". - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - Paramount Pictures Corporation (known professionally as Paramount Pictures and often referred to simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994.

There are two types of reruns those that occur during a hiatus, and those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (for example, in the afternoon). - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Frederick Schiller Faust (May 29, 1892 May 12, 1944) was an American author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns under the pen name Max Brand.

Shortly after the character's first appearance in a magazine story, Paramount Pictures used the story and character as the basis for the 1937 film \\"Internes Can't Take Money\\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) subsequently acquired the rights and featured Kildare as the primary character in a series of American theatrical films in the late 1930s and early 1940s, several of which were co-written by Faust (as Max Brand), who also continued to write magazine stories and novels about the character until the early 1940s. The Kildare character was later featured in an early 1950s radio series, a 1960s television series, a comic book and comic strip based on the 1960s TV show, and a short-lived second 1970s television series. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Lorne Hyman Greene, (born Lyon Himan Green; February 12, 1915 September 11, 1987) was a Canadian actor, radio personality, and singer. - Pernell Elven Roberts, Jr. (May 18, 1928 January 24, 2010) was an American stage, film, and television actor, as well as a singer.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Twilight Zone is an American television anthology series created by Rod Serling. The episodes are in various genres, including psychological horror, fantasy, science fiction, suspense, and psychological thriller; and often conclude with a macabre or unexpected twist, and usually with a moral.

Please answer the following question: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank.

The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season.

Since the birth of my son, I've been driving the SUV more often than the sports car since the OPT: (I) SUV feels less safe.; (II) sports car feels less safe.;","completion":"Since the birth of my son, I've been driving the SUV more often than the sports car since the sports car feels less safe. This decision was made after considering several important factors. Step 1: Evaluate the Safety Features First, I compared the safety features of both vehicles. The SUV offers more comprehensive safety features such as advanced airbags, stability control, and better visibility due to its higher seating position. The sports car, while equipped with standard safety features, lacks many of the advanced options available in the SUV. Step 2: Research Crash Test Ratings After assessing the safety features, I dug into the crash test ratings of both vehicles. The SUV consistently scored higher in crash tests conducted by various safety organizations, indicating a higher level of protection in the event of a collision. The sports car performed adequately, but its ratings were not as impressive as the SUV's. Step 3: Consider Practicality Practicality played a significant role in my decision, as having a child requires extra space for things like strollers, diaper bags, and car seats. The SUV offers more cargo space and seating capacity, making it an ideal choice for a family. Step 4: Assess the Ease of Use To ensure that traveling with a child is as smooth and stress-free as possible, I evaluated the ease of use of both vehicles. The SUV's higher ground clearance made it easier to install and remove the car seat and load/unload the stroller, whereas the sports car's lower ground clearance proved to be more challenging. Step 5: Factor in Fuel Economy While fuel economy is generally not the top priority when considering safety, I still wanted to be conscientious of our family's overall fuel consumption. Surprisingly, many modern SUVs offer comparable fuel economy to certain sports cars, so deciding to drive the SUV more often did not drastically increase our fuel costs. After going through these steps, the choice was clear - the sports car simply did not meet the safety and practicality criteria necessary for our growing family. As a result, I've been driving the SUV more frequently, providing a sense of security knowing my son is in a safer vehicle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: can you suggest one application of sound waves in oceanography?? Answer:","completion":"Yes, one application of sound waves in oceanography is in the use of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs). Step 1: Identifying the need Oceanographers need to collect data on ocean currents for various reasons such as understanding environmental changes, monitoring climate patterns, and ensuring maritime safety. Step 2: Choosing the appropriate technology Since sound waves can travel long distances underwater with minimal energy loss, they are a suitable tool for probing ocean waters and measuring currents. Step 3: Implementing the technique ADCPs work by emitting sound waves at a specific frequency into the water. These sound waves then bounce off particles suspended in the water column, such as plankton or sediment particles. Step 4: Measuring the reflected sound waves Upon reflection, the sound waves experience a frequency shift due to the Doppler effect, which is related to the relative motion of the particles and the ADCP. The reflected sound waves are detected by the ADCP's transducers. Step 5: Analyzing the data By analyzing the returned sound waves' frequency shifts, oceanographers can determine the speed and direction of water particles at different depths, providing information about ocean current patterns at various levels. Step 6: Applying the information Through the use of ADCPs, oceanographers can gain a better understanding of ocean currents and their effects on weather, climate, and marine ecosystems. This information can also be used to improve maritime navigation, plan research operations, and address other ocean-related issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. When Tara and Willow meet, their proficiency at magic is about the same, but Tara's knowledge of the craft far exceeds Willow's. Tara reveals that she has been practicing magic for most of her life, as her deceased mother had also been a powerful witch. Throughout season 4, Tara acts as a partner and guide in Willow's witchcraft, teaching Willow spells and performing magic together. Willow, however, is inherently talented, despite being new to the craft, and begins to progress much faster than Tara in the fifth season, including experimentations in dark magic. Tara struggles with understanding her place among the Scoobies with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the leader, with which has a very friendly relationship; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), Willow's friend since childhood; and Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), their mentor. Tara's primary role throughout the series is that of Willow's partner. She feels somewhat useless until the fifth season episode \\"Family\\" when the entire Scooby Gang (Spike included) makes it clear that she is unquestionably a part of them. The episode introduces some of Tara's blood family: a cold, authoritarian father who has lied to her all her life (telling her that her magical powers are a result of her being part-demon on her mother's side); an overbearing brother; and a judgmental, repressed and repressive cousin; all of whom Tara dismisses at the end of the episode. Tara later reveals in \\"The Body\\" that her mother had died when she was 17. In the following episode, when Dawn is acting out, Tara confides to Buffy that she had to deal with her brother after her mother's death. No more of her backstory is revealed in the series. As Willow's character grows more self-assured and powerful through the seasons, Tara takes over some of the role of being placed in peril and needing to be rescued. The fifth season's primary villain, or Big Bad, is Glory, a goddess too powerful for Buffy to fight alone. Glory tortures Tara in order to gain information on the Key, but Tara asserts willpower and resists Glory, resulting in Glory stealing her sanity, and prompting Willow to go searching for retribution. Glory states she feels \\"buzzed\\" after feeding on Tara's mind, indicating Tara's powerful intellect (and possibly suggesting her power as a witch). Buffy scholar Ian Shuttleworth writes that Benson was able to \\"admirably\\" portray the same range of emotions inherent in Tara although the character loses her identity. Willow's powers are significant enough that she is able to battle Glory more effectively than Buffy, if not completely successfully. In the final episode of season 5, Willow uses her magic to restore Tara's sanity, significantly weakening Glory in the process. Tara also becomes a guide of sorts, and a maternal figure. She appears to Buffy in a dream in the fourth season finale \\"Restless\\" to tell her about the arrival of Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) and act as a translator for the voiceless First Slayer. Following the death of Joyce Summers and Buffy's sacrifice to save the world at the end of the fifth season, Tara and Willow move into the Summers house, taking Joyce's bedroom and becoming Dawn's surrogate parents.","completion":"This text is about Tara Maclay, a fictional character from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pedro Answer:","completion":"Title: Echoes of Love Genre: Drama, Romance Plot Summary: In a small, picturesque seaside town in Spain, a group of close friends and family mourn the passing of Abuela Carmen, the beloved matriarch of the community. Carmen, known for her endless wisdom, love for the sea, and captivating storytelling, has left an indelible mark on everyone she met. Among the mourners is Pedro, a talented but aloof writer, who shares an unspoken bond with Carmen's grandson, Bernardo. As the story unfolds, we learn that Pedro and Bernardo, once inseparable childhood friends, have drifted apart over the years. Their friendship was a casualty of time and circumstance, and the bustling city life that swallowed Bernardo whole after moving away. But the death of Bernardo's grandmother, Carmen, draws Bernardo back to the small town he left years ago, reigniting his relationship with Pedro and reviving memories of their shared past. Pedro struggles with his own hidden feelings for Bernardo, but is hesitant to express his lament and condolences. He tries to focus on his writing, immersing himself in a fictional world of romance where the unspoken is alluded to but never actualized. But as Pedro delves into the pages of his writing, he begins to understand that the emotions hidden between the lines are a mirror, reflecting his own secret longing for Bernardo. Bernardo, now a successful businessman in the city, recognizes that his life lacks the depth and connection he once had with Pedro. This realization draws him closer to his roots, the sea, and the small town he left behind to chase his dreams. Despite all the material success, he feels an emptiness in his heart, only amplified by the passing of his grandmother. Fate brings Pedro and Bernardo together as they spend time reconnecting with their shared memories and exploring their once-forgotten bond. Pedro, inspired by the memory of Abuela Carmen, finally musters the courage to express his lament for Carmen's passing and his true feelings for Bernardo. This heartfelt revelation leads to an emotional climax in which the two rediscover their buried love and make a promise to embrace the moment and never let go again. The movie concludes with Pedro and Bernardo walking hand in hand on the beach, the waves gently lapping at the shore, as the sea that once separated them now serves as a beautiful reminder of their enduring love and the powerful connections that bind them all together. Echoes of Love is a poignant, bittersweet tale of love, loss, and the transformative power of human connections, all set against the backdrop of a charming seaside town. This heartfelt movie transcends traditional boundaries and serves as a reminder that true love knows no limits and has the power to withstand the passage of time."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below. I am facing a new situation today: John works for the NSF. He has two research proposals in front of him, case A and case B. Both are looking for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, but case B research could not be replicated by others. He needs to decide which research should get further funding. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In case A, did the scientist more likely of less likely commit a fraud than the scientist in case B? A:","completion":"Considering the information you acquired from the background article, it would be more likely that the scientist in case B has committed fraud than the scientist in case A. The reasoning behind this is that in the provided background article, the study that could not be replicated was eventually found to be fraudulent. Because case A's research has been successfully replicated by other researchers, it reduces the likelihood of fraudulent behaviour. Case B's research, like the original study in the background article, could not be replicated, thus increasing the possibility of fraud. So, based on this comparison, the scientist in case B is more likely to have committed a fraud than the one in case A. Please note that this is a general analysis based on the given background information and does not conclusively indicate fraud.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @hummingbird604 yea...happens alot b/c of my former exhib industry career...i have free passes to most films...end up having 2 take peeps","completion":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, one would first need to break it down and comprehend its context and meaning. The tweet is directed towards user @hummingbird604 and discusses the author's experience with their former exhibition industry career, which results in them having free passes to a majority of films and having to take people along as a consequence. The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of casual, positive, and slightly boastful. Let's analyze why this is the case: 1. Casual: The style of the tweet is conversational and employs colloquial language, such as \\"yea,\\" \\"b/c\\" (because), \\"peeps\\" (people) and the use of the ellipsis. This informal style creates a relaxed, casual tone, suggesting the author is not being particularly serious or formal. 2. Positive: The mention of free passes to most films is generally considered a good thing, as it highlights an advantage that the author has experienced due to their previous career. The tweet also has an underlying sense of gratitude for these perks, despite having to take people along. The use of \\"end up having 2 take peeps\\" implies some level of enjoyment in sharing this perk with others, which contributes to the positive tone. 3. Slightly boastful: Although the overall sentiment is positive, the author's statement about their free access to movies might come across as slightly boastful. This is because the author indirectly implies their access to exclusive benefits that others may not have. While this is not necessarily negative, the author sounds proud of their previous career and might seem to be subtly bragging about their ability to watch movies for free. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as casually positive, with the author both celebrating and mildly boasting about their perks because of their former exhibition industry career. The author seems content with their access to free movies and enjoys sharing this experience with others, while also maintaining a conversational, laid-back tone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is...\\"What did I just watch????\\" And I mean that in a good and bad way. The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends/neighbors. Stiller is the focused, hardworker while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo. The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy. As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is plain odd. The direction is odd, with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequences. The dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way. And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie, from the weird \\"Envy\\" song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in Japanese. So, the true question is this...is odd funny? That depends purely on the individual. I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie. After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free. Strangely, I understood their point. There are no jokes whatsoever, so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1948. His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved, first to Derry City, where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949. His mother, Monica, and the two boys then moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland,and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a member of The Irish Showband. In 1961, Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop of Cork's McCurtain Street. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under PS100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother Donal recalled: \\"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\\" The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one. Most of the paint was removed from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as evidenced from contemporary photographs. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays. On 21 and 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \\"Cradle Rock\\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying.

He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

Choices: - wet soil - start to fall - dry soil - wet things - wet ground The rationale to choose \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain because of wet soil. The rationale behind choosing \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is threefold: 1. Oxygen availability: Worms breathe through their skin, and when the soil gets saturated with rainwater, there is a reduced availability of oxygen. To ensure sufficient oxygen supply and avoid suffocation, worms move up and out of the wet soil. 2. Ease of movement: Wet soil is softer and more manageable, making it easier for worms to navigate through the earth. Rainwater helps to lubricate the soil particles and reduces the friction that hinders worms' movement when the soil is dry. This provides an excellent opportunity for worms to move to new areas, find food, and escape predators. 3. Mating opportunities: Earthworms may come to the surface during heavy rainfall for mating purposes. The wet conditions create a favorable environment for worms to release their mucus-coated cocoons containing eggs and sperm. This allows fertilization to occur when the worms come in contact with each other. In summary, the primary reason worms crawl out of the earth during rain is the wet soil, which makes it easier for them to move, breathe, and reproduce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which astronaut, part of the Apollo 12 mission on November 19th 1969 became the 4th person to walk on the moon after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Pete Conrad ?","completion":"On November 19th, 1969, during the Apollo 12 mission, Alan L. Bean became the fourth person to walk on the moon after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Apollo 12 Commander Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad. Born on March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, Alan LaVern Bean was an accomplished astronaut, aeronautical engineer, and painter. Before his well-known lunar excursion, Bean graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1955 with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering. He subsequently joined the Navy, where he became a test pilot and completed a tour as a fighter pilot. His impressive background and expertise caught the attention of NASA, which selected him in 1963 as part of their third astronaut group. Bean's historic Apollo 12 mission was his first spaceflight. Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the Apollo program and the second to land on the moon. Alongside mission Commander Pete Conrad, Bean piloted the Lunar Module \\"Intrepid\\" to the moon's surface, more specifically, to the Ocean of Storms region. Their journey took place just over four months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first stepped on the lunar surface as part of Apollo 11. While on the moon, Bean and Conrad conducted two extravehicular activities (EVAs), collectively totaling over eight hours. During their time outside the lunar module, they were able to collect 75 pounds (34 kg) of lunar samples, including rocks and soil. They also deployed various scientific instruments like the solar wind spectrometer and the lunar seismometer. One memorable moment from their mission was when Alan Bean inadvertently pointed a color television camera lens at the sun, destroying the camera’s ability to relay live images of their activities back to Earth. In addition to his role in the Apollo 12 mission, Alan Bean was the spacecraft commander for Skylab 3, which was the second manned mission to the Skylab space station in 1973. Along with fellow crew members Jack R. Lousma and Owen K. Garriott, Bean conducted numerous scientific experiments and spent 59 days in orbit. Bean retired from NASA in 1981 and pursued a career as an artist, focusing on the varied experiences he and other astronauts had during their space missions. His paintings often depicted the lunar surface, the Apollo spacecraft, and astronauts conducting tasks in the unique lunar environment. Alan Bean passed away on May 26, 2018, at the age of 86. His contributions to the space program, both as an astronaut and as an artist, have left a lasting legacy and provided invaluable insights into the Apollo missions and the moon's surface. His role as the fourth person to walk on the moon solidified Bean's place in history and inspired future generations to explore the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: Where would a cat sit to soak up sunlight? Options: - barn - house - window sill - humane society - comfortable chair","completion":"The option most in line with common sense when answering the question, \\"Where would a cat sit to soak up sunlight?\\" is the window sill. A detailed explanation follows: 1. Window sill: This is the perfect place for a cat to sit and soak up sunlight. Cats are known to enjoy sunbathing, and window sills offer an elevated, narrow space where cats can perch, as they enjoy being off the ground. Window sills provide direct access to sunlight and warmth, which cats find very comfortable. Additionally, these spaces frequently provide a nice view of the outdoors, offering entertainment in the form of watching birds, squirrels, or other critters that may pass by. While the other options have their own merits, they do not offer the same level of comfort, exposure to sunlight, or sense of safety as a window sill: 2. Barn: A barn may offer some sunlight if there are windows or open doors, but it is not specifically designed with the intention of letting in sunlight for cats to enjoy. Cats may find the environment unfamiliar, and it might be harder for them to find a comfortable, safe place to rest and soak up the sun. 3. House: A house, in general, could have many spots where sunlight comes in, such as near windows, sliding doors, or skylights. Nevertheless, it is not a specific location where a cat would naturally gravitate to soak up sunlight. Plus, the option is too broad and could include areas where a cat might not enjoy the sun. 4. Humane society: This location refers to an animal shelter or adoption center. While cats living in a humane society might get some sunlight through windows or outdoor enclosures, it is not a place inherently designed for cats to soak up sunlight. It is mainly a temporary holding place where they await new homes. 5. Comfortable chair: A comfortable chair might be appealing if it is placed near a window with sunlight streaming in. However, it is not the primary focus when it comes to cats soaking up sunlight. Chairs may not always be located near sources of sunlight or offer the elevation and narrow space that cats typically prefer for resting. In summary, a window sill provides the best combination of direct sunlight, elevation, warmth, and safety that cats prefer when choosing a spot to soak up sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness. Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying. If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment. For commitment is in fact quite painful. The single life is filled with fun, adventure and excitement. Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguishing features. Similarly, couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness. They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want. Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation. I don't know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children. The way people stick to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real... In the writer's opinion, marriage _ . A) means the end of fun B) leads to less sleep C) leads to raising children D) means responsibility Answer:","completion":"The writer's opinion suggests that marriage \\"D) means responsibility\\". Marriage is described as a commitment which can involve pain, sacrifice and is not always fun. With marriage, couples could face responsibilities such as raising children which can lead to less sleep and less personal freedom, but it provides a deeper, more lasting form of happiness than mere fun or excitement. It's a deeper sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with shared experiences, challenges, and achievements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process after acid rain kills fish and soils in trees is the disruption of the ecosystem, leading to a decline in biodiversity and the overall health of the environment. Acid rain can cause the alteration of soil composition, leaching away essential nutrients such as calcium, and releasing harmful substances like aluminum. This negatively impacts plant growth, causing the weakening or death of trees and other vegetation, and can contribute to forest decline. As trees and plants suffer from the effects of acid rain, the ecosystems they support also suffer. The death of aquatic life due to acidic water disrupts the food chain, affecting organisms at various trophic levels, and reducing biodiversity. Terrestrial animals that depend on the plants and trees for food, shelter, and habitat will also be impacted by the decline in forest health caused by acid rain. As a result, entire ecosystems can become compromised, causing a ripple effect that reaches far beyond the immediate plants and animals directly affected by acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The original statement provides us with the following information: 1. The man is formally dressed: This information indicates that the man is wearing clothes that are appropriate for formal occasions. This could include events such as weddings, sophisticated parties, business meetings, or any other events with a formal dress code. However, we cannot deduce that this specific event is a wedding based on this information alone. 2. The man is smiling upwards: The man's facial expression and direction imply that he is feeling joy, happiness, or satisfaction as he performs the split. However, this information does not necessarily link his behavior to a wedding. There could be various reasons for the man to express happiness while doing a split during a formal occasion, but we cannot ascertain any particular reason with the current data. 3. The man performs a split: Lastly, the man is executing a split - a challenging and often attention-grabbing move. This part of the statement also does not provide any direct connection to a wedding. In conclusion, the statement \\"The formally-dressed man smiles upwards as he does a split.\\" does not logically imply that \\"A man in classy clothes performs a split at a wedding.\\" Although it is plausible that the event might be a wedding, there is not enough information or context provided to confirm this assumption.

Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

While it is true that cars in colder climates (such as the northern regions) may be less reliant on air conditioning, there are several other factors to consider. 1. The age of the car: Older cars may not have air conditioning, regardless of their geographical origin. Automotive air conditioning systems started to become more popular during the 1960s, but they were not a standard feature in all vehicles until later years. 2. The make and model of the car: Cars vary in their features, and not all cars are equipped with air conditioning. Some low-cost or basic models may omit air conditioning to make them more affordable. 3. Owner preference: The original owner of the car may have chosen not to have air conditioning installed due to personal preference, regardless of the location. 4. Cost of installation and maintenance: Installing and maintaining an air conditioning system can be expensive. For some car owners, especially those in a tight budget, the expense may not be worth the potential benefit. 5. Climate change: The need for air conditioning in cars has increased over the years as global temperatures have risen. A car from a currently colder northern region may not have needed air conditioning in the past when temperatures were cooler. 6. Cultural factors: Some individuals or communities may not prioritize air conditioning in their cars due to a cultural preference for fresh air and natural ventilation. Given these factors, it would be a hasty generalization to conclude that the car is from the north based only on the lack of air conditioning. More information about the car itself, as well as the preferences and circumstances of the original owner would be required in order to make a more informed judgment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kaplow had also paid Lootz's casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better.

News article: The matchmaking app for people who want to make friends not love ‘Wiith’, a new San Francisco-based app, is designed to buddy you up with people looking for buddies. And that's it. No romance, no sex, just pure, unadulterated friendship. Think of it as a Tinder for making friends. The premise is simple: if you’re new to a city, or just want to meet someone new, the app connects you with like-minded others inside a set radius. You sign up via Facebook, build a basic profile, then approach people for friendship or arrange social events and invite others along. • The Tinderisation of modern life is on the rise I arranged a coffee meet-up for Saturday at 5.30pm, which after half an hour a guy called Harpal said he was coming to. I also followed a man called Jeff, something that means Wiith will notify me when he creates an event, and told some bloke called Youcef I’d join him for a run on tomorrow at 9pm. Youcef actually approved my coming along, and as I write this very sentence has just pinged me to say ‘hey’. I don’t really want to go for a run tomorrow. I feel bad now. Would you like to be friends with Jeff? It’s true that the current market for community-based dating and networking is becoming increasingly saturated. A fresh dating app seems to spring up every month, and friendship platforms are following suit – today, the young, mobile generation appreciates the practicality and instantaneous nature of forming relationships by scrolling through pictures and sending a few messages. With that in mind, Wiith already has a few similar models to compete with. There’s Skout, which brands itself as more of a friend app but has morphed into more of a dating landscape. Peoplehunt exists, too, although it is now mainly a tool for finding others who might be able to help you with something (language exchange classes are popular on the format). The most popular friend app around at the moment is Meetup, by a stretch. However, the app was founded as a website; its mobile platform isn't the smoothest, lacking the responsive, quick-fire style of its new competitor. • Bristlr: a dating app for bearded men and the women who love them Wiith co-founder Jeff Hodnett told TechCruch that he believed Meetup is “too rigid” for more natural, spontaneous get-togethers. It’s here where the app’s likeness to Tinder becomes starkly apparent. The new model is apparently more fluid, loose, and appears to favour randomness – all things young people enjoy. “We think Wiith is a lot more spontaneous than Meetup, along with not having the dating stigma of Tinder,” Hodnett said. If Wiith does manage to attract users and take on some of Meetups’ 20 million-plus fan base, it could prove a popular choice for business travellers keen to find someone to share an evening meal with, and city newbies hoping to track down a running partner within hours of unpacking their trainers. As for me, I'm hoping that some of those people sign up in the next 24 hours and make Youcef a proper offer... What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article is about the launch of a new San Francisco-based app called 'Wiith,' a matchmaking app focused solely on helping people make new friends in a city rather than finding romantic connections. Key points from the article include: 1. Wiith is designed to connect people seeking friendship, without any romance or sexual intentions. 2. The app functions similarly to Tinder, allowing users to sign up via Facebook, create a profile, and then approach people for friendship or arrange social events within a set radius. 3. Wiith's intention is to help users who are new to a city or just want to meet new people. 4. The popularity of dating apps is on the rise, and friendship platforms are now starting to follow in those footsteps. 5. Wiith faces competition from other similar apps, such as Skout and Peoplehunt, as well as the more popular and established platform, Meetup. 6. The app's co-founder, Jeff Hodnett, believes that Wiith is more spontaneous than Meetup and lacks the dating stigma associated with Tinder. 7. If the app can attract users and gain popularity, it might be an ideal choice for business travelers and newcomers to a city looking for companionship or activity partners. Overall, the article highlights the launch of a new app, Wiith, focused on helping people make friends and connect with like-minded individuals in a city. The app is designed to provide a more spontaneous and relaxed way to meet new people without the pressure of dating, setting it apart from popular dating apps like Tinder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old.

Then, pour water into the bowl until the candle is almost covered. Leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) of candle sticking out of the water for the spell. It's best to use a black candle, if you have one. You can find a black taper candle at a department store, magickal supplies store, or online. Pour salt into your hand, then slowly sprinkle it in a circle around the candle. Add as much salt as you like to provide extra purification to your spell. You can use table salt for this, but it’s best to use sea salt or Epsom salt if you have it. They haven’t been processed like table salt, so their properties are more intact. a white light flowing into the water. Stare at the bowl of water and picture a beam of white light flowing into the bowl. Imagine that this light is a positive, cleansing light. Take several slow, deep breaths as you visualize the light. In Pagan traditions, the purpose of this practice is to imbue the water with positive energy to help your spell work. Use a match or lighter to light the candle. As it burns, recite a spell or say a prayer to break your curse. Make sure you finish your spell before the candle goes out. You might say, “Earth, fire, water, and air, be the answer to my prayer, banish this curse and leave me pure, tonight I claim a blessed cure.” You could pray, “Dear God/Goddess, Please cleanse me of this negative energy and lift the curse. I know that you will make me free. Amen.” Don’t blow out your candle because it’s best to let it go out on its own. Let the candle continue burning until the wick reaches the water. At that point, the water will extinguish the fire. Your spell is almost complete! In Pagan traditions, it's believed that letting a candle go out on its own strengthens the spell and keeps the magic in place. Remove the candle from the water and bend it at the center. Keep bending until it breaks in half. Then, take the bowl and the candle outside. Dig a shallow hole and bury your candle. Burying the candle completes the spell to break the curse. Slowly pour the water so that you’re able to complete an entire circle. If you still have water, make another pass. You do this to seal the spell. The salt may kill grass around the buried candle.

Options: - hang in closet - sniff - get dirty - become soiled - air out Explain why a human would choose \\"air out\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"air out\\" as the best option for dealing with clothes that have developed a smell but cannot be washed. The other options given do not provide a practical solution to the problem, while air out resolves the issue effectively without causing any damage to the clothes. 1. Hang in closet: Hanging the smelly clothes in the closet might not alleviate the smell. In fact, it could cause the smell to spread to other clothes, making the problem worse. A closet can be a confined space, which could trap the odor and make it linger even longer. 2. Sniff: Sniffing the smelly clothes would not provide any solution to the issue. It would only confirm that the clothes indeed have a smell. 3. Get dirty: Getting the clothes dirty would not help the situation. Adding more dirt and grime to the clothes would not remove the smell but may even make it worse. 4. Become soiled: Similar to getting the clothes dirty, becoming soiled would also not help in solving the odor problem; it would only add to the discomfort and make the clothes even less wearable. On the other hand: 5. Air out: Airing out the clothes involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area, allowing fresh air and sunlight to naturally neutralize the smell. Airing out the clothes can help eliminate odors by allowing the smell to dissipate into the air. Moreover, sunlight has natural antibacterial and odor-neutralizing properties, which can further help in removing the smell from the clothes. In conclusion, a human would choose to \\"air out\\" smelly clothes that cannot be washed, because it is the most effective and practical method among the given options. Airing out allows for natural odor removal, does not cause any harm to the clothes, and prevents the spread of smell to other garments. The other options do not address the issue of eliminating the smell; instead, they might even make the problem worse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Will it permanently change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it? Will unknown artists potentially break into the top 10? We spoke to George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra. Streaming's gradually grown over the last couple of years. Meanwhile, digital downloads had been growing up until about nine months ago and looking at the data, they started to go into decline. I think there is a real correlation there, that streaming is starting to grow and it's starting to eat into download sales. So we've had week on week, for the last nine months, a decline in the amount of digital music being purchased. There is going to be an effect. It's not hugely significant because at the end of the day we're looking at huge volumes to get into the top 40, huge numbers of people listening to a song or huge numbers of people deciding to download it each week, actually those two are very closely connected. There's only ever so many truly memorable, powerful hit records in the market at any point in time that the huge mass market scale people are interested in. So actually the differences are there but they are relatively slight. I think that is actually the biggest issue out there at the moment, everybody has got access to so much music, how do you get to know what you like? Take a snapshot of what records at any moment in time people are enjoying listening to, it could be because it was on an advert or a film like Frozen or it could be because it is heavily supported on radio. Culturally there is still a huge import to the chart, as a kind of very simple measure of the most popular records in the market at any point in time, and that's a powerful play in terms of discovery as much as anything. We've got a pretty good awareness of what is going on in the market but there's no doubt we do keep a close eye. There's certain tracks occasionally and certain artists where we've decided we'll wait a little longer on it, see how it goes before we commit to putting them on the playlist. When you can see that they are doing really well in streaming or they are doing really well in the sales chart, then of course that can be an important bit of information to say there's quite a large number of people who are enjoying it, we should look at that again. No, I think it's really important that if we are talking about an accurate reflection of what people are listening to or are consuming in 2014 we need to include streaming alongside sales. But in terms of the dramatic effect or change it will have, no, because actually the top 40 as a snapshot of a moment in time works and it's very similar in both the streaming space and in the singles purchasing space. Follow us @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and @Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube Summary:","completion":"The inclusion of streaming data in the Top 40 is being seen as one of the biggest changes since downloads were added in 2005, and it has sparked discussions about whether it will change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it. In an interview, George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra, revealed that streaming has gradually grown over the last couple of years while digital downloads have started to decline. This correlation suggests that streaming is eating into download sales. Although the effects of this shift might not be hugely significant, it does represent a change in the way people consume music. Ergatoudis argues that finding music people like is the biggest issue, as there is now so much access to it. The Top 40, therefore, remains an important tool for discovering popular records in the market at any point in time. As for unknown artists potentially breaking into the top 10, Ergatoudis acknowledges that certain tracks and artists occasionally receive close attention from the industry before being added to playlists or promoted more widely. Streaming performance can be an important factor in determining whether an artist is worth further consideration. Overall, including streaming data alongside sales is essential for accurately reflecting music consumption in 2014. While it may not have a dramatic effect on the Top 40's composition, it does represent a more comprehensive snapshot of the music landscape at any given moment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I had an absolutely incredible time dining at Culinary Dreams last weekend, and I cannot sing their praises enough. This restaurant has managed to create an unforgettable experience, succeeding in both impeccable service and wonderfully diverse, mouth-watering dishes. From the moment I entered the premises, the ambience was nothing short of fantastic. The warm lighting combined with the beautifully arranged décor gave off a welcoming and cozy atmosphere. To enhance the experience, a soft, soothing live jazz performance provided the perfect musical backdrop as we enjoyed our meal. Upon being seated by the ever-friendly and professionally dressed host, the extensive and diverse menu offered a variety of dishes I was eager to try. The assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options was impressive, that catered to the different dietary preferences of our party. To start, we ordered the bruschetta trio, which was a hit among my companions. The three unique variants - classic tomato and basil, sweet balsamic caramelized onions, and avocado and beet - created a perfect harmony of flavors, with each bite more delightful than the last. As the main course, I chose the pan-seared sea bass, and it was truly among the best I’ve ever sampled. The fish was tender and flavorful, while the accompanying lemon-caper sauce perfectly enhanced the dish without overpowering it. To top it off, the garlic mashed potatoes were creamy, smooth, and full of flavor - a star component themselves. Considering their attention to detail and a wide variety of desserts to choose from, it was almost impossible to select just one! We collectively decided to share their decadent chocolate lava cake and the fruity, refreshing mango-passionfruit cheesecake. Both were heavenly, with the rich, gooey chocolate lava cake soothing our sweet cravings and the velvety cheesecake lightening the palate. In addition to their impressive menu, the service at Culinary Dreams was exceptional. Our server, Amanda, went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. Attentive, informative, and exceptionally friendly, Amanda made stellar recommendations and ensured all our needs were met throughout the evening. Overall, my experience at Culinary Dreams far exceeded my expectations. This gem of a restaurant offers divine dishes to satisfy any craving, impeccable service that makes you feel at home, and an atmosphere that ensures an unforgettable dining experience. I recommend Culinary Dreams to everyone, and I cannot wait to return for another remarkable evening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo.

With a land area of approximately , Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world after Algeria. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Islamic architecture encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day. What today is known as Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries. Further east, it was also influenced by Chinese and Indian architecture as Islam spread to Southeast Asia. The principal Islamic architectural types are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture. - Shukri al - Quwatli ( 1891 -- 30 June 1967 ; Arabic : ) was the first president of post-independence Syria . He began his career as a dissident working towards the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire 's Arab territories and was consequently imprisoned and tortured for his activism . When the Kingdom of Syria was established , Quwatli became a government official , though he was disillusioned with monarchism and co-founded the republican Independence Party . Quwatli was immediately sentenced to death by the French who took control over Syria in 1920 . Afterward , he based himself in Cairo where he served as the chief ambassador of the Syrian - Palestinian Congress , cultivating particularly strong ties with Saudi Arabia . He used these connections to help finance the Great Syrian Revolt . In 1930 , the French pardoned Quwatli and thereafter , he returned to Syria , where he gradually became a principal leader of the National Bloc . He was elected president in 1943 and oversaw Syria 's independence three years later . Quwatli was reelected in 1948 , but was toppled in a military coup in 1949 . He subsequently went into exile in Egypt , returning to Syria in 1955 to participate in the presidential election , which he won . A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist - dominated government , Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War . After his request for aid from the United States was denied , he drew closer to the Eastern bloc . He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact . In 1957 , Quwatli , who the US and the Pact countries failed to oust , sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria , but to no avail . By then , his political authority had receded as the military increasingly bypassed Quwatli 's jurisdiction by separately coordinating with Quwatli 's erstwhile backer , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . In 1958 , after months of unity talks , Quwatli merged Syria with Egypt to form the... - The Great Syrian Revolt or Great Druze Revolt (19251927) was a general uprising across Mandatory Syria and Lebanon aimed at getting rid of the French, who had been in control of the region since the end of World War I. The uprising was not centrally coordinated; rather, it was attempted by multiple factions among them Sunni, Druze, Alawite, Christian, and Shia with the common goal of ending French rule. The revolt was ultimately put down by French forces. - Mehmed II (\\"Memed-i sn\\"; Modern ; 30 March 1432 3 May 1481), best known as Mehmed the Conqueror, was an Ottoman sultan who ruled first for a short time from August 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to May 1481. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and brought an end to the Eastern Roman Empire. Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. Mehmed is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A top Dallas doctor today described the moment nurse Nina Pham learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared'. Dr Gary Weinstein worked alongside 26-year-old Miss Pham to treat Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. He said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the deadly virus, saying: 'She risked her life to care for a patient, and now she was afraid for her life.' But he added: 'I think once she got over the initial fear and concern and was surrounded by her friends and colleagues, that was comforting. She did remarkably well, emotionally.' Scroll down for videos. Doctor: Dr Gary Weinstein today described the moment his colleague Nina Pham, 26, learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared' Victim: Dr Weinstein worked alongside Miss Pham (pictured, left, and, right, in hospital after her diagnosis) to treat Mr Duncan, a Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. Miss Pham, who suffered from a fever with a temperature of above 100.5 degrees prior to her devastating diagnosis, is now in a 'fair' condition at a National Institutes of Health isolation unit. She is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second worker, Amber Vinson, 29, was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane with a quarantine unit. Speaking to WFAA-TV, Dr Weinstein insisted the two nurses - along with the rest of the team - had followed CDC guidelines, which, at the time, did not include the use of a full respiratory mask. When asked why Miss Pham and Miss Vinson caught Ebola, he said: 'I think that these two nurses took care of a critically-ill patient at a time when he was not in control of his body fluids. 'And at a time when the recommendations from the CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) that we were following did not include the full respiratory mask.' Bedridden: Dr Weinstein, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry (pictured), said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the virus. Comforting: The doctor, who was behind the camera, told the brave nurse: 'Well, happy tears are okay' Hospital: During the converstion, Dr Weinsten insisted Miss Pham - along with the rest of the team at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured) - had followed CDC guidelines during their care of Mr Duncan. His comments are in stark contrast to the CDC's claims that a 'breach of protocol' must have taken place to enable the infection to spread through the two nurses' protective gear. The center is currently preparing to issue new guidelines on protective gear to safeguard the well-being of doctors and nurses who are caring for Ebola patients. During the conversation, Dr Weinstei said despite knowing of Mr Duncan's contagious condition, both Miss Vinson and Miss Pham volunteered to look after him, joining an 'amazing' medical team. 'It's been so heartwarming. This kind of illness, this process that we've been through, this is the essence of nursing. This is the epitome of health care,' he said. Another patient: Miss Pham is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second, Amber Vinson (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. Transfer: She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane. The doctor, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry - unless they were 'happy tears'' - gave the nurse a hug in his hazmat suit following her diagnosis. He told the news station that Mr Duncan's death 10 days ago was 'very, very quick', saying: 'He was critically ill and unstable, and over a period of minutes, he lost his pulse and was dead,' He also revealed that, in terms of Ebola, he considered himself to be 'no risk', despite having spent days caring for all three victims of the disease at the Dallas-based hospital. He said this was because Mr Duncan's bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask in the presence of all three patients. Tragic: Dr Weinstein said he considered himself 'no risk' because Mr Duncan's (pictured) bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask at all times. 'My only interactions with any of these patients have been in completely covered respirators, no skin showing to the outside world,' said Dr Weinstein. 'I think I'm no risk.' However, he revealed he has been asked by officials to avoid public places and public transport, and to take his temperature on a daily basis. According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Outbreak: It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center. Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa. Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @katieluckylegs Hahahahaha i love your drunk ass","completion":"In analyzing the sentiment of this tweet, one could describe it as exhibiting a generally positive and light-hearted tone. This conclusion is drawn from a combination of the specific words and phrases used, as well as the overall context of the message. First, the tweet begins with \\"Hahahahaha,\\" which is an expression of laughter. This suggests that the tweet's author found something amusing, further indicating a positive sentiment. The presence of laughter also connotes a relaxed and informal atmosphere, setting the stage for the rest of the message. Next, the phrase \\"i love\\" clearly communicates a positive feeling, as the word \\"love\\" denotes affection and fondness for something or someone. In this case, it seems that the tweet's author is referring to the person they are mentioning, \\"katieluckylegs\\". Moreover, the phrase \\"your drunk ass\\" may initially be seen as a negative or derogatory remark from a conventional standpoint. However, when taking the whole tweet into context, it is more likely to be an affectionate and playful tease directed towards the mentioned person. The word \\"drunk\\" indicates that the subject of the tweet is probably under the influence of alcohol, and the usage of the word \\"ass\\" can be colloquial slang to refer to a person informally. Therefore, it is fair to assume that the tweet is meant to poke fun at a close friend's intoxicated state in a light-hearted and non-malicious manner. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive, jovial, and humorous, reflecting the tweet author's enjoyment and affection towards their friend's amusing behavior while intoxicated.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Question: suppose crust is pushed upward happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth. Justification: Gases are formed due to the Earth's mantle melting and producing magma. As the magma gets closer to the Earth's crust, the pressure of these gases increases. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. Justification: When the pressure of the gases becomes too high, they push the molten magma towards the Earth's surface, eventually reaching a weak point in the crust and erupting. Step 3: The magma cools. Justification: Once the magma reaches the Earth's surface, it starts to cool down and solidify, forming volcanic rocks and other materials. Step 4: With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. Justification: As more magma and gases accumulate beneath the crust, the pressure continues to build, eventually resulting in a volcanic eruption. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode. Justification: If the pressure builds up to a certain threshold, it may cause a large, explosive eruption. Now, let's consider the scenario where the crust is pushed upward, and how it may affect smaller eruptions: If the crust is pushed upward, the pressure required for an eruption could increase, as the magma would need to travel a greater distance to reach the surface. This could lead to: 1. Less effect on smaller eruptions - If the pressure required for smaller eruptions is not significantly changed by the crust being pushed upward, then it is possible that these eruptions will continue to occur at a similar frequency and intensity. 2. More effect on smaller eruptions - If the increased distance and pressure required for the magma to reach the surface significantly impacts smaller eruptions, they may become less frequent or less intense, as more pressure would be needed for an eruption to occur. 3. No effect on smaller eruptions - If the upward movement of the crust has no significant impact on the pressure required for an eruption or the magma's ability to reach the surface, then the smaller eruptions may continue to occur as they were previously. In summary, the answer to the question is dependent on the specific conditions and how much the crust is pushed upward. If the crust's movement significantly changes the pressure required for eruptions, it may result in smaller eruptions occurring less frequently or less intensely. On the other hand, if there is no significant impact on the pressure required for eruptions, there may be no effect on smaller eruptions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Attacking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by name, taking a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s concern over terror attacks in Milwaukee, and mocking Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s presidential aspirations, the New England Democrat has no qualms about taking the fight to the GOP. “Such a charitable man,” Malloy said of Christie, with a proverbial tongue in his cheek. “He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he.” Moments earlier, in an interview with TIME on Thursday, he muffled a laugh as he described Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose remarks he once called “the most insane statement I’ve ever heard,” as the “toughest one to beat in the Republican field.” Seizing an opportunity in a party depleted of household names not Clinton or Obama, Malloy is rising to the occasion, positioning himself as one of the party’s top attack dogs as the 2016 cycle approaches. But Malloy is also envisioning a larger role for himself within the party too. Addressing the winter meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs Thursday he delivered a fiery speech, imploring the party to refocus on its core values. “When we run as Republican-lite we lose,” he said. “Let us be Democrats once again,” he added, earning a standing ovation and whooping cheers. Malloy was one of the few Democratic success stories of 2014, expanding his margin of victory in a repeat of his 2010 grudge match with Republican Tom Foley. He holds up his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes as a model for other Democrats. As the chair-designate of the Democratic Governors Association, it will be Malloy’s job next year to try to pick up seats from Republicans, who now hold a near-record 31 governorships. Speaking to TIME, Malloy wasn’t shy about attacking his GOP colleagues, and expanded on his call for the Democratic Party to stop being “Republicans-lite.” Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript: Gov. Dan Malloy: My message is first of all we’ve got to elect a democratic president. Otherwise the hard fought gains that we made under this president will be swept away. We’ve got to begin the process of changing the Congress and each election we need to pick up seats and we need to be on the offensive. What I’m hoping to do is see Democrats get elected. That’s what I’m trying to contribute to. TIME: But you’re saying the right type of Democrat, right? Malloy: I think any Democrat is better. But I think what my message is, it’s about running as a Democrat. It’s about talking about Democratic values. I think we have to talk about Democratic values in this country again, because I think Republicans and their allies on Fox and elsewhere have done a good job of confusing people about who is actually pulling for them. You know and I know and economists know that trickle-down economics doesn’t work. But we’ve got all kinds of people in this country who are confused by what they hear on fox everyday or elsewhere everyday and actually believe that somehow that’s going to trickle down to them even though during the last 25-30 years when trickle-down has been so often rolled out by Republicans, the middle class has not gotten bigger, wages are not up, quality of life for many of our citizens is not increasing the way that it should. So I think we need to be talking about our values versus their values. Listen, I’ve got rich friend. I don’t mind the rich getting richer, but the poor shouldn’t be getting poorer and there should be more people moving into the middle class. TIME: Are some Democrats in Washington not doing enough of that? Did that contribute to the defeats in 2014? Malloy: I think there are a lot of people who consciously or unconsciously, ran away from the president and the ideals of the party, and I’m not going to name names, but I think it’s important that we do what Republicans do, and view elections as a portion of the continuum, not as a stand-alone event. And every election needs to be built in part on the prior one and every new success needs to be built upon a prior success. And if we do that I think we’ll be stronger. TIME: Looking ahead to 2016, should there be other Democrats entering the race to have this sort of dialogue? Malloy: That’s up to other people. I think people have to make their decisions about whether they want to run. I think there are a lot of Democrats who want Hillary to run and I think she would be an extremely strong candidate for the nomination and to be elected. I’m glad we don’t have 23 people running for president right now, although, as I said, I think the toughest one to beat would be Bobby Jindal. So we have to worry about him. People are either going to run for president or not, she’s going to either run for president or not, I think it looks more and more like that she’s going to, but she’ll cross that bridge when she gets to it. TIME: Have you ever given it any thought? Malloy: No. Whenever people say you should president, I say, ‘I thought you liked me.’ Listen, I thought being mayor of Stamford was a wonderful job. Being governor of a state for a period of time is a wonderful job, and I’m not sure I’m at all attracted to Washington. TIME: Gov. Chris Christie to your south seems to be having a bit of a rough turn. Malloy: Such a charitable man. He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he. TIME: He’s been facing some budget issues and dealing with pension reform… Malloy: Dealing with pension reform. He’s in the process of destroying public pensions, which by the way comes out of the Republican playbook. He hasn’t told the truth about what he’s doing, but that’s what he’s doing. The level of defunding that’s taken place under his administration is remarkable and I think the state’s bond rating will pay perhaps not a permanent price, but a longterm price. He’ll saddle that problem to some unfortunate Democrat who’s going to have to come in and do the right thing. That’s the hard part about being a Democrat, you have to clean up after Republicans. TIME: Are you concerned that momentum Republicans are showing? Malloy: Yeah, that’s why I gave a speech. That’s why I think we have to rise as Democrats. I understand that everybody’s got to make tough choices in elections, but to defund your pension system by billions and billions of dollars, which is what New Jersey has done is not the right thing to do. To take away people’s rights to collectively negotiate their contracts, that’s not the right thing to do. And neither one of those things is going to help the middle class of those states. It’s just not going to. In some states it works to bash people who are a little bit better off than you to maybe make you feel better, but it is not a proven way to raise up the middle class, to raise the size of the middle class or to raise people’s standards of living. TIME: On gun control, do you see a path to revitalizing the national conversation around gun control? Malloy: There will be more and more events like Sandy Hook. Look at the number of children that have been killed in schools since Sandy Hook. I’ve stopped counting, it’s astronomical when you think about the killing of children or babies. This discussion is not done. People actually understand that mentally ill people should not be able to buy guns, that people with violent felony backgrounds should not be able to buy guns. They understand that. It’s when the other side wraps it with rhetoric like ‘they want to take your gun away.’ Well, no one wants to take your gun away, unless you’re, you know, a violent felon or you’re mentally ill, or you’ve threatened someone with it. That’s not happening anywhere. This conversation’s going to play out over a long period of time, and then the states that have done something about it, like my state, we continue to see a precipitous drop in homicides, and crime falling in Connecticut at three times the national average. TIME: Where do you stand on the legalization of marijuana? Malloy: That’s not something I’m interested in. I decriminalized marijuana. We have 6,000 fewer arrests as a result of decriminalizing it, and we passed medical marijuana and I’m comfortable with where we are. I think it would be a mistake to become involved in the sale of marijuana for income purposes. It should be a standalone decision, it shouldn’t be based on whether you’re going to get a little money for it. TIME: You’re taking over as chair of the DGA next year, what are you hoping to accomplish? Malloy: There are not a lot of Democratic governors, and we need to go our and fight the fight and take some of those states back and lay the groundwork for taking others back four years from now. I’ve always played a leadership role in any organization I’ve been apart of and I certainly have been the beneficiary of other governors, so I want to pay that back. I think this is important work. I think what Republicans pulled off in state legislatures following the Census and their wins in 2010 has been very hurtful to the country. We have too few districts in the country that are in play, and as a result the Congress of the United States doesn’t do what it was intended to do, and that is to actually represent the majority will of the people. They’ve in other words, been gerrymandered. TIME: Do you plan to step up your role in the party? Malloy: Obviously I’m here, and I was asked to speak, and there weren’t a whole lot of wins, so they’ve asked me to participate. And yes I’m going to play a role in trying to get more people elected as Democrats to the Houses and Senates and Assemblies, and more governors, and I’m on the lookout for good candidates for governor in the 2016 cycle. Some of those are pretty well set and some of those are going to be pretty wide open. TIME: Have you started the recruitment process? Malloy: We are engaged in the recruitment process. That begins with talking to people who are expressing interest and making sure that people understand what it is to be a candidate in a statewide election. You have a lot of folks who want to run who’ve never run statewide and it’s not an easy thing to do. Part of our job is to make sure people understand and are sufficiently committed to doing that. TIME: What are your thoughts on the Republican governors who have warned about the threat of ISIS as their party is embroiled in a shutdown fight over the Department of Homeland Security. Malloy: Those Republican governors should talk to the Republican members of Congress who are threatening to defund the agency that they are otherwise relying on. You know, it’s a wonderful thing, Republicans have both sides of their mouth and they’re able to use them well. The governor complains that there is a threat of ISIS in Milwaukee, but the Republican members of the Congress vote against funding the agency that’s charged with protecting us from it because they have a disagreement with the president over the ability of the people who were brought to this country as children and who have graduated from our school systems, to stay in this country. When they only speak English. That’s what this fight’s about. Republicans—they want to have both sides of the immigration issue, they want to have both sides of the job issue, they want to have both sides of the healthcare issue, and it’s incumbent on some of us not to let them get away with it. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy's combative approach toward his Republican peers, putting himself in the spotlight by attacking them by name and challenging their political ideals. Malloy, as a rising figure within the Democratic party, is positioning himself as a top attack dog, envisioning a larger role for himself within the party. In addition to his criticism of Republican policies, Malloy is also vocal about his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes. Malloy expresses the need for the Democratic party to refocus on its core values and actively fight against the influence of the Republican party. He emphasizes the importance of talking about Democratic values and countering the misleading messages spread by Republicans and their allies. Malloy aims to strengthen the Democratic party by helping to elect more Democrats into Houses, Senates, Assemblies, and Governors’ seats. As the chair-designate of the Democratic Governors Association, Malloy plans to focus on recruiting strong candidates for governor in the 2016 election cycle."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Passage: Established on Kīlauea in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), presently a branch of the United States Geological Survey, is the primary organization associated with the monitoring, observance, and study of Hawaiian volcanoes. Thomas A. Jaggar, the observatory's founder, attempted a summit expedition to Mauna Loa to observe its 1914 eruption, but was rebuffed by the arduous trek required (see Ascents). After soliciting help from Lorrin A. Thurston, in 1915 he was able to persuade the US Army to construct a \\"simple route to the summit\\" for public and scientific use, a project completed in December of that year; the Observatory has maintained a presence on the volcano ever since.Eruptions on Mauna Loa are almost always preceded and accompanied by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring of which was the primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by more than a year of seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.The modern monitoring system on Mauna Loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a 76 mm (3 in) increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare. The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo, Mauna Loa's summit caldera, as well as a publicly accessible live webcam and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging.

Summarize this article: But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr the UK needed a \\"hard-headed assessment\\" of issues such as the EU customs union. On the same programme, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox did not reveal his stance on the customs union, which sets standard tariffs EU-wide. He said he was \\"a free trader\\", but the government would reach a view. Staying a member of the customs union would, however, mean \\"limitations\\" on the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, which would in turn limit the kind of deals it could do with the rest of the world, Mr Fox added. Who has access to the single market? What are the UK's post-Brexit trade options? Mr Osborne, who argued for Remain, said it was essential that close relations with countries such as France and Germany were not sacrificed in pursuit of new trade deals with other nations including China. He told the Andrew Marr Show: \\"Yes it's true the grass may be greener outside of these arrangements and we may be able to conduct new trade deals with the United States, Australia and so on. \\"But that shouldn't come at a price of giving up existing free trade agreements we have with Germany and France. \\"You can't say we are a beacon of free trade in the world and then the main thing you achieve is a huge act of protectionism, the biggest in British history.\\" Mr Osborne - who lost his job in the cabinet after the referendum - admitted the Remain campaign lacked \\"some of the authenticity and optimism\\" of the Leave camp, and focused too much on dire predictions. \\"We discovered there was not much out there in terms of support for European friendship and so we ended up talking a lot about the economy and, as chancellor, of course, I was centre stage in that.\\" He also said the pledge to get net migration down to the tens of thousands \\"damaged\\" the government in the referendum because \\"we didn't really have an answer\\" when challenged on why it had been missed. Mr Osborne said he hoped the predictions he made about the economy post-Brexit turn out \\"not to be true.\\" But he told the programme he would \\"wait and see what happens\\" as the pound had fallen sharply since the referendum and Britain was \\"poorer as a result\\". Also speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Fox said Brexit the question of the customs union was \\"not binary\\". \\"I hear people talking about hard Brexit and soft Brexit as though it's a boiled egg we are talking about, it's a little more complex. So, Turkey, for example, is in part of the customs union, but not in other parts.\\" Mr Osborne's appearance on the show marked his first TV interview since he was sacked by Prime Minister Theresa May. He said he had \\"learned a lot\\" during his time as chancellor and wanted to attempt to understand what he had got right and what went wrong. During the London 2012 Paralympics he was booed while handing out a medal, which he admitted \\"hurt\\", particularly as his children were in the crowd. But he added: \\"Sometimes those moments do help change you for the better.\\" He said his work trying to promote a Northern Powerhouse was also allowing him to travel around the country and attempt to \\"understand why people feel the system is not working for them\\". Earlier this week, the former chancellor told a Commons debate British MPs were deceiving themselves if they thought they did not have some responsibility for what had happened in Syria. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the perspectives of the UK's international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and former British Chancellor, George Osborne, on the EU customs union, in relation to Brexit. Fox did not disclose his position on keeping the UK in the customs union, which sets standard EU-wide tariffs. However, he mentioned that continuing as a member would constrain the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, and this could restrict what trade deals the UK could establish with countries outside the EU. In contrast, Osborne urged not to sacrifice relations with EU countries like France and Germany to pursue new trade agreements with nations like China. He added that abandoning existing free trade deals with Germany and France may symbolize the UK as a protectionist state, which could contradict its position as a proponent of global free trade. Further, Osborne admitted that the Remain campaign during the Brexit referendum lacked the authentic appeal of the Leave campaign. He also believed the government's commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands to have negatively impacted the referendum's outcome. He conveyed his hopes that the economic predictions he made regarding post-Brexit consequences are proved wrong, as the consequent sharp fall in the pound's value has made the UK poorer. Fox also compared Brexit with a complex situation rather than the simplistic views of a 'hard' or 'soft' Brexit, using Turkey as an example of a country that is part of some components of the customs union but not others. The article also covered Osborne's first television interview after his dismissal by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. During his interview, he reconciled with his past experiences as a chancellor and acknowledged his moments of criticism while recognizing his efforts to understand why people feel the societal system is not working for them. Furthermore, Osborne referred to the UK's collective responsibility over the crisis in Syria during a previous Commons debate."},{"prompt":"Tom Sawyer is known as one of the most beloved characters in American literature , but new research found that Mark Twain based this character on his friend named Tom Sawyer. He admired his firefighting friend so much that he gave the character his name. Mark Twain and Tom Sawyer had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in pubs. Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship. Mark Twain was particularly moved by this story because his own brother died in a fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became friends immediately after meeting in 1863, with Tom Sawyer traveling to Virginia City, while Mark Twain was working as a reporter there. After one night they returned to San Francisco, Mark Twain told his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. Tom Sawyer said, \\"One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'\\" Besides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him.

Instead, it is a positive review of a film directed by a master filmmaker, presumably Stanley Kubrick. The reviewer acknowledges watching the film with an open mind and finds it to be very good with several aspects, such as its beautiful cinematography, strong acting, and the love and care put into the creation of the film. While the reviewer does mention that Kubrick has had better stories in the past, this statement isn't necessarily negative. It's merely contrasting the reviewed film with other works by the same director. The fact that they still found the story engaging shows that they appreciated the narrative despite the comparison. The visuals of the film alone make it worth renting, as per the reviewer, which also adds to the positive nature of the review.

His inheritance The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Lost Inheritance Plot Summary: When the wealthy tycoon, Benjamin Walker, passes away, his estranged son, Lucas, is left with no choice but to return to his family's estate to claim his inheritance. Upon his arrival, he quickly discovers that his conniving stepmother, Natalie, and her cunning son, Troy, have devised a plan to swindle him out of his birthright. Forced to grapple with a twisted family dynamic and unsure of who to trust, Lucas sets out on a thrilling journey to uncover the truth and secure his rightful fortune. Act 1: Lucas Walker, a young and successful architect, receives the news of his father's death, and with great reluctance, he returns to his childhood home: the magnificent and sprawling Walker Estate. He's greeted by his stepmother Natalie, who's seemingly kind, offering her condolences, but Lucas sees through her façade. While attending the reading of his father's will, he's shocked to find out that his inheritance, including the estate and his father's company, has been left in the hands of Troy, his conniving half-brother. Lucas firmly believes that he's entitled to at least half of the fortune but is told by the family lawyer that the will is rock-solid. Act 2: Feeling betrayed, Lucas starts investigating the truth behind the will. During his search, he comes across his father's secret study, where he finds hints that lead him to believe there might be a hidden, authentic will that could reinstate his inheritance. He confides in Emma, the family housekeeper, who has known him since childhood and is skeptical of Natalie's motives. As Lucas delves deeper, he discovers that his father had evidence of Natalie's infidelities and was planning on divorcing her. He realizes that she must have orchestrated the false will to secure her own future. Lucas and Emma collaborate to find the real will by following clues left through encrypted letters, coded messages, and secret compartments within the estate. Act 3: The pursuit of the truth becomes increasingly dangerous when Lucas realizes that Troy is monitoring his every move, desperate to protect the ill-gotten fortune. Several near-death encounters send Lucas and Emma spiraling deeper into this twisted family saga. In a climactic confrontation with Natalie and Troy, Lucas uncovers the authentic will and learns that his father was, indeed, leaving everything to him. The family lawyer, who had been in cahoots with Natalie, is exposed as a co-conspirator in the plot. In the end, Lucas successfully reclaims his inheritance, bringing Natalie and Troy to justice. He decides to honor his father's legacy by taking over the company and turning the Walker Estate into a home for underprivileged children. Grateful for Emma's loyalty and support, he promotes her to the estate's general manager. Despite all the betrayal, Lucas finds solace in knowing that he restored the family's values and integrity that his father once stood for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: static shot framed by a tree","completion":"In the sentence \\"static shot framed by a tree,\\" the most important words are: 1. Static: This word is significant because it describes the type of shot being used in the context of photography or videography. A static shot is a shot where the camera remains stationary and does not move or pan while capturing the image or scene. This information is essential to understand the composition and nature of the shot. 2. Shot: The word \\"shot\\" is central to the sentence, as it represents the subject being discussed—a photographic or video frame. In photography and filmmaking, a shot refers to a single, continuous view taken by a camera without interruption. Understanding that we are talking about an image or scene framed by the camera is crucial to make sense of the sentence. 3. Framed: \\"Framed\\" is an essential term in the context, as it suggests how the shot will be visually composed. To frame something means to position specific elements within the shot in an aesthetically appealing manner, creating a pleasing and attention-catching presentation of the scene. In this case, it indicates that there exists a compositional element in the shot that impacts the visual experience. 4. Tree: Finally, \\"tree\\" is an important word, as it provides information about the specific element being used to frame the shot. It is a natural object that serves as a visual component within the scene, giving the viewer a sense of context, depth, and variety in the landscape. The tree's inclusion in the composition provides a sense of balance and adds a distinct quality to the overall shot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The film is centered around a group of friends who get stranded in the open sea while on a yacht excursion. Amy (played by Susan May Pratt) is dealing with a childhood trauma involving water and is reluctant to leave the boat. Step 1: Briefly describe the critical event that leads to them being stranded During the movie, one of the friends, Zach, suggests that they all go swimming. They all jump into the water, forgetting to lower the yacht's ladder before getting off the boat. This leaves them stranded in the water with no way to get back on the boat. Step 2: Describe the progression of the story and the fates of the characters Throughout the film, the friends struggle with exhaustion, dehydration, panic, and some suffer from severe injuries. Dan (played by Eric Dane) is shown in several scenes sleeping or unconscious on the boat as the others struggle in the water. One by one, the characters face various fates: 1. Michelle drowns after exhaustion from swimming and trying to get back on the boat. 2. Lauren dies after falling from a makeshift rope that the group forms to reach the boat's railing. 3. James gets bitten by sharks and dies in Amy's arms. 4. Zach, in a desperate attempt, kills Dan to use his body as bait in hopes of attracting a shark to bite their rope to get them closer to the boat, but the plan fails & Zach gets bitten by a shark and dies. Step 3: Reveal the final character's fate Amy, still in the water and traumatized by the events, hallucinates seeing her daughter, Sara, fall into the water. Driven by her motherly instincts, Amy manages to overcome her fear and climb back onto the boat to \\"save\\" her daughter.

Question 2: How old do you have to be to volunteer for a political campaign? In 2018 I will be 15 years old. Will I be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns? Options are: [-] no. [-] yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: If the atmosphere was much thicker than it is now, how would the sun appear? If the atmosphere were much thicker than it currently is, several changes would occur that would affect the appearance of the sun. The overall density of the air would be higher, leading to increased scattering of the sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere. As a result, the sun would appear less intense and more diffuse or larger. Additionally, a thicker atmosphere would cause increased absorption of certain parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light. This could result in a sun that appears more reddish in color, as shorter wavelengths of light (blue and green) would be scattered more effectively, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate. Lastly, the overall brightness of the sun might be reduced due to the larger amount of absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere. The sky itself might appear more hazy, particularly during sunrise and sunset when the sun is low in the sky and its light has to pass through a greater amount of the atmosphere. Question 2: How old do you have to be to volunteer for a political campaign? In 2018 I will be 15 years-old. Will I be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns? The age at which someone can volunteer for a political campaign varies depending on the specific requirements of the campaign itself, as well as any legal requirements or restrictions. Generally, there is no federal legal age requirement for volunteering on political campaigns, but individual campaigns or local laws may have specific age requirements. In many cases, teenagers as young as 15 years old (like yourself) are able to volunteer for political campaigns, but the types of tasks or activities they can participate in may be limited. In some cases, volunteers under 18 may need parental permission or supervision. Overall, it is likely that you would be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns in some capacity as a 15-year-old, but you may need to check with the specific campaign or organization that you're interested in volunteering with to ensure you meet their requirements or guidelines. As for the answer to the two questions being the same, it is clear that the subjects of the questions are different and not directly related. The first question deals with the appearance of the sun if the Earth's atmosphere were to be thicker, while the second question pertains to eligibility to volunteer for a political campaign based on age. Therefore, the answers to these two questions would not be the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: When the world was young, the gods did battle in the sky. The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus. Hyperion has sent the Minotaur (Robert Maillet) and soldiers to intercept them. The soldiers kill Daerios but, after a brutal battle with the Minotaur, Theseus uses the Bow to... Answer:","completion":"Critically discuss the themes and characterization represented in the movie plot about the mythical world where gods, Titans, and humans cohabit. How does the film use King Hyperion's search for the Bow of Epirus and his desire to free the Titans reflect his internal conflicts and bitterness towards the gods, in particular towards their indifference towards human suffering? How does the character of Theseus evolve as the plot progresses, from a reluctant hero forced into a mission to avenge his mother's death to the protector of humanity? Examine the manner in which the relationship between Theseus and Phaedra develops, and how it further affects Theseus's objectives and motivations. Can you identify the implication of Phaedra's vision when she touches Theseus? Also, review how the gods implement their plans to intervene despite Zeus’s prohibition unless the Titans are freed. Reflect on how the movie unfolds the role of the Bow of Epirus and its significance in the plotline. How are its powers and characteristics explained and demonstrated throughout the film, particularly during the encounter with the Minotaur and soldiers? Furthermore, analyze how the narrative presents the Greek mythology that includes Mt. Olympus, Mt. Tartarus, the Sybelline Monastery, Minotaur, among others. How does it deal with their traditional definitions and imagery? How does the film's plot tie in these mythical elements and align with or deviate from the classical stories? Lastly, delve into the representation of divine intervention and free will and how they play into the movie's plot progress. Assess the moral implications the movie suggests in the conflict between gods and humans, the power struggle among the gods themselves, and humans’ confrontation with their own destinies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house.

Question: Question: \\"What expertise did sales people have?\\" Context: \\"Microsoft began an advertising campaign centered around Windows 8 and its Surface tablet in October 2012, starting with its first television advertisement premiering on October 14, 2012. Microsoft's advertising budget of US1.5–1.8 billion was significantly larger than the US200 million campaign used to promote Windows 95. As part of its campaign, Microsoft set up 34 pop-up stores inside malls (primarily focusing on Surface), provided training for retail employees in partnership with Intel, and collaborated with the electronics store chain Best Buy to design expanded spaces to showcase devices. In an effort to make retail displays of Windows 8 devices more \\"personal\\", Microsoft also developed a character known in English-speaking markets as \\"Allison Brown\\", whose fictional profile (including personal photos, contacts, and emails) is also featured on demonstration units of Windows 8 devices.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, I will break down the context provided and identify the expertise sales people had in promoting Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Step 1: Understand the context In this context, Microsoft started a massive advertising campaign for Windows 8 and Surface tablet in October 2012.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

Q: To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\" <sep>Who was asked to send a letter to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research?<sep>Einstein A:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. However, one in six adults in Scotland was the victim of at least one crime in the year to the end of March 2013. The Scottish Crime and Justice survey (SCJS) showed that theft or damage to property was the most widely reported crime, making up 71% of the figures. The SCJS also reported the risk of crime in Scotland to be lower than that in England and Wales. The survey showed there was a total of 815,000 recorded incidents of crime over the past year. The new figures showed a 22% drop from the 1,045,000 recorded incidents in 2008-2009. The risk of being a victim of crime also dropped from 20.4% in 2008-2009 to 16.9% in 2012-2013, a drop described as \\"significant\\" by the report. Those living in the most deprived areas were more likely to be a victim of crime. Violent crime continued to fall, with a 25% drop in recorded incidents since 2008-2009. However, the public's fear of being the victim of a violent crime such as mugging has increased, with the perceived risk being almost 20% higher than the actual one. The statistics also showed that public confidence in the police and justice system had increased, with 61% of people saying they believed that their local police were doing a good job. Over three quarters of people surveyed also believed that the level of crime in their areas had stayed the same or reduced. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: \\"This survey confirms what we already know. Crime is falling, the risk of being a victim of crime is falling and more people are feeling safer in their communities. \\"The chance of being a victim of crime continues to be in lower in Scotland than in England and Wales and violent crime in Scotland has fallen by a quarter since 2008-2009. It is also reassuring to see that confidence in the police and the criminal justice system continues to improve. He added: \\"These statistical trends are consistent with recorded crime statistics which show crime in Scotland is at its lowest level in almost 40 years with the 1,000 additional police officers that this government has put in communities protecting the public.\\" Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont questioned the effectiveness of the survey by saying that many victims of crime did not report it. He said: \\"There are a number of areas of concern within these findings. It's clear far too many people are victims of crime, and a significant amount don't even bother reporting it because they don't believe it will be solved. \\"There is a big difference in what victims want and what actually happens, and one way the SNP could deal with this is facing up to justice matters and dropping its soft-touch approach.\\" He then added: \\"It is extremely rich of the SNP to be bleating about crime and policing rates when it has closed 60% of Scotland's police stations.\\" Scottish Labour's Community Safety spokeswoman, Elaine Murray said: \\"While any reduction in crime is to be welcomed, the fact that violent crime is up and only a fraction of crime is reported to the police gives cause for concern. \\"The figures also won't reflect the closure of police counters, nor the police officers being taken off our streets to backfill staff roles left empty by SNP cuts. \\"I fear that with the loss of local, accountable policing we will see the potential for the overall figures to begin to move the other way and for confidence in our police to fall back\\", she added.

Jake Travers, an American posing as a graduate student from Cornell University, was at the scene of the blast and is held as a witness by a police detective of Detachment 88, Lieutenant Hashim. After interviewing Jake at the crime scene, Hasim and Jake are attacked by terrorists led by Malik and his henchman Achmed. Jake saves Hashim and kills two terrorists, but Achmed manages to escape. Hashim becomes suspicious after he observes Jake's combat skills. Jake and Hashim are brought to the hospital where Hashim's wife meets Jake. At Hashim's wife's insistence, Hashim invites Jake to their house for breakfast. At the house, Hashim tells Jake that he ran a background check on him through Interpol. Jake tells Hashim he is an FBI agent conducting an undercover investigation, and suggests they cooperate with one another. Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's. Jake's friend informs him that the tattoo is typically used by Chinese high-class prostitutes, which confirms Jake's suspicion that the body is not Sultana's. Jake follows a lead to a night club, where he brings home a prostitute bearing a similar tattoo.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Options: A. not enough information B. Get all of their work done C. Feel like they're stuck D.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do fires ignited with fuel convert energy into?\\" is \\"oil\\", given that fires ignited with fuel convert energy into light and heat? The answer is:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do fires ignited with fuel convert energy into?\\" is not \\"oil\\". The reason is that when we talk about fires ignited with fuel, we are referring to the process of combustion. Combustion is a chemical reaction that involves the rapid combination of a fuel source with an oxidizer, such as oxygen, producing energy in the form of heat and light. This is also known as an exothermic reaction, as it releases energy. Given that the provided question asks about the energy conversion in a fire ignited with fuel, it would be incorrect to answer \\"oil\\" because oil is not a product of energy conversion in this context. Instead, the correct answer would be that fires ignited with fuel convert energy into heat and light, as stated in the original information provided. Heat and light energy produced by fires are crucial for various applications in our everyday lives, such as cooking, heating, and industrial processes. Heat energy generated during combustion can be harnessed to produce steam, which can power turbines and generate electricity in power plants. On a smaller scale, we utilize the heat produced by burning fuel to cook our food and warm our homes. Light energy produced during combustion can be seen as the visible glow created by burning materials. This glow, or flame, is a result of excited molecules and atoms releasing energy in the form of light photons. Light emitted by fire has been essential throughout human history, providing illumination before the invention of artificial lights. In summary, fires ignited with fuel do not convert energy into \\"oil\\"; they convert energy into heat and light. This energy release is essential for various human activities, from heating our homes to powering large-scale industries. Understanding how combustion works and the energy conversion processes involved helps us use fire responsibly and efficiently to meet our needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?

Article: At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education says, \\" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" Question: Which of the students is most likely to stay focused? - A boy sitting in a warm room. - A standing boy faced with stress. - A girl standing in a cold room. - A girl facing a lot of pressure.

Rooftop beekeeper A recent Thursday: Spencer Marshall methodically zipped a white bee suit from his waist to his chin, then pulled a meshed hood over his head to protect himself from venomous harm. Only after he was all secure did he light a piece of burlap, put it in a tin smoker and start replacing the beehives in the rooftop garden at the Fairmont Hotel. Patrons of the hotel were none the wiser as thousands of bees swarmed the skyline just above Marshall’s head. It was business as usual for the hotel, for Marshall and for his bees. Marshall, 69, has worked with bees for 40 years and manages more than 500 hives in 70 locations all over the Bay Area. His organic honey operation, Marshall’s Farm Honey in American Canyon near Napa, produces more than 50,000 pounds of honey per year. He has a pretty good idea of what kind of conditions bees need to make copious amount of honey. You wouldn’t think the Fairmont roof would supply those conditions. Marshall himself was skeptical when the hotel’s chef asked him four years ago if he would bring some of his bees to the Nob Hill landmark to exchange for earmarking a modest amount of honey for the kitchen – 10 pounds a year per hive, to be exact. Still, he said OK. And last year, four double-queen hives atop the Fairmont produced more than 1,000 pounds of honey. “In this day and age,” Marshall said, “that’s unheard of.” “We’re right up here where the wind is always blowing … and all you see is concrete, asphalt and big huge high-rise buildings. You don’t see any fields of flowers,” Marshall said. “I really can’t explain it. The only thing I can think that makes sense to me is they have very little competition, and the weather must be just right for them.” Marshall comes from a long line of beekeepers. His great-grandmother raised hives in the Yellowstone area, and Marshall helped his grandmother work a few hives on the family farm in Lodi growing up. But bees and honey weren’t Marshall’s first vocational choice. As a young man he worked on television productions, taught and even did a stint as a carpenter, but nothing felt like the perfect fit. Then his father was paralyzed in a car accident, and Marshall came home to help run the corn and wheat farm. To keep his “sanity,” he said, he took up beekeeping as a hobby. “I kept doing bees, kept doing bees – and one day I asked myself, what’s wrong with bees?” he said. “It’s what I wanted to do. It’s what I read about; it’s what I thought about. It was like, oh yeah, this is it! I don’t have to search anymore.” Four decades and 35,000 stings later, he still loves it. “I’m almost like a doctor, where I’m going into the hive and figuring out what’s going on and what kind of help they need,” Marshall said. “You know, trying to make them stronger, healthier, more productive. “You’re not just punching a clock. You’re involved in something bigger than yourself.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

To do this, we will move the 393297 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: -9364*w = -102995 - 393297 Now, we have: -9364*w = -496292 To find w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -9364: w = -496292 / -9364 When you divide -496292 by -9364, you get: w = 53 So, the answer is w = 53."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
