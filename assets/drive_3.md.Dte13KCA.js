Without mitotic replication, your body would not be able to heal itself, or even grow. When mitosis happens, your dna replicates itself. Pick your answer from: (i) To get an idea for what will happen in your body, you need to know what will happen in your cellular stem. Mitosis occurs when blood vessels become broken open. (ii) The number of milliliters of produced meiosis could be up to 20 milliliters. Meiosis formation occurs at different rates depending on your type of disorder. (iii) During mitosis, your cells divide and they also exhibit clear phases : First, the dna condenses into chromosomes and the chromosomes align. Then, the daughter chromosomes are pulled apart and they move to the cell poles (the edges of the cell). (iv) It remains in contact with your dna through its rapidly growing dna. This process is almost identical to what happens when meiosis occurs.","completion":"(iii) During mitosis, your cells divide and they also exhibit clear phases: First, the DNA condenses into chromosomes and the chromosomes align. Then, the daughter chromosomes are pulled apart and they move to the cell poles (the edges of the cell). To differentiate between mitosis and meiosis, it's essential to understand the key differences between the two processes. While both mitosis and meiosis involve the cell division and replication of genetic material, their purpose, stages, and outcomes are quite different. Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells. This process plays an essential role in growth, development, and tissue repair within multicellular organisms. Mitosis consists of four major phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. As mentioned in the answer above, the DNA condenses into chromosomes, which then align at the center of the cell. The daughter chromosomes separate and move to the opposite poles of the cell, followed by the cell membrane splitting to form two new cells. On the other hand, meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms. The purpose of this process is to produce haploid gametes (sperm in males and eggs in females) with half the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Meiosis consists of two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. In total, there are eight distinct phases, which include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase for both meiosis I, and II. There are several distinguishing features between mitosis and meiosis: 1. Purpose: Mitosis is crucial for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms, while meiosis ensures genetic diversity through sexual reproduction. 2. Number of divisions: Mitosis involves a single cell division, whereas meiosis involves two consecutive divisions, resulting in four unique haploid cells. 3. Number of daughter cells: Mitosis produces two identical diploid cells, while meiosis creates four genetically diverse haploid cells. 4. Genetic diversity: Mitosis generates genetically identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis involves genetic variation through processes like crossing over and independent assortment, producing genetically unique gametes. 5. Occurrence: Mitosis occurs in all body cells (somatic cells) with the exception of sex cells, whereas meiosis occurs only in sex cells (germ cells). In conclusion, differentiating between mitosis and meiosis involves understanding the distinctions in their purpose, number of divisions, daughter cells produced, genetic diversity, and occurrence within the organism. While both processes involve cell division and replication of genetic material, they serve different functions and outcomes in multicellular organisms."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Se väite, että Euroopan unioni ei WTO-sopimusten mukaan saa laajentaa öljykasviensa viljelyalaa, on kestämätön. Translate to English","completion":"The claim that, according to WTO agreements, the European Union is not allowed to expand its oilseed cultivation area is unsustainable. This statement argues that, based on World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, the European Union (EU) cannot increase the area allotted for oilseed crop cultivation. However, this argument is deemed to be unsustainable, for various reasons. First, it is essential to understand that the WTO's primary goal is to facilitate international trade by reducing trade barriers, tariffs, and other obstacles between countries. It does not regulate domestic agricultural policies directly. However, the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) indirectly affects these policies by imposing certain limits on domestic support and export subsidies. This agreement aims to help member countries to create a level playing field and prevent distortions in global agricultural trade. In the context of oilseed cultivation in the EU, it is crucial to consider that the expansion of such agricultural activities may be more influenced by region-specific policies rather than WTO agreements. For example, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a significant role in shaping agricultural practices within its member states, providing financial support, ensuring food security, and maintaining the environmental sustainability of farming. In recent years, the EU has been encouraging the growth of oilseed crops, such as rapeseed and sunflower, in response to increasing global demand for vegetable oils, mainly for the production of biodiesel. Furthermore, crop diversification and achieving environmental goals have become priorities for EU agriculture, which could provide incentives for oilseed expansion. When looking into the WTO's agreements, there are no explicit provisions prohibiting a member country from expanding its oilseed cultivation area. The EU's oilseed farming activities are largely subject to demonstrating their compliance with environmental, sanitary, and other regulations imposed by the WTO and their consistency with the principles of fair trade. Additionally, under the WTO rules, any expansion of oilseed cultivation by the EU must adhere to the limits of domestic support to avoid distorting global markets. Provided the EU complies with these regulations, the expansion of oilseed production is not explicitly forbidden. Given these factors, the claim that the EU cannot expand its oilseed cultivation area according to WTO agreements appears to be unsustainable and not rooted in the actual regulations imposed by the organization. While compliance with certain limits and rules is necessary for maintaining fair trade principles, there is no outright ban on increasing oilseed cultivation. The EU's decisions regarding its agricultural policies and oilseed expansion, therefore, depend more on internal policies and evaluating the environmental, economic, and social implications associated with such actions."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

Question: Who is the Special Activities Division operative? Title: Spy Game Movie plot: Set in 1991, the film depicts the U.S. and Chinese Governments on the verge of a major trade agreement, with the American President due to pay a visit to China to seal the deal. The Central Intelligence Agency gets word that their Special Activities Division operative Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been captured trying to free an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), from a Chinese prison near Su Chou (Suzhou). Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed within twenty-four hours unless he is claimed by the U.S. Government, so they scramble to decide what to doif they claim Bishop as an agent, they risk destroying the trade agreement. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that Bishop was operating in a \\"rogue\\" capacity without permission from the Agency.In an attempt to quickly deal with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement, and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir that they simply need him to act as a \\"stop gap\\" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are in reality hoping that what he gives them is the smoking gun they need to justify letting Bishop die. Realizing as much, Muir attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to CNN through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that the CIA will rescue Tom once a public outcry puts pressure on them to do so. Unfortunately for Muir, the tactic only stalls them, as a phone call to the FCC from a high ranking executive results in CNN retracting the story.During the debriefing, referred to above, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop into the MACV-SOG while the latter was an Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam. Muir also discusses their tour of duty in Berlin in 1975. Both sub-plots are given extensive time in the film. Considerable time is also devoted to Muir and Bishop's spy work in Lebanon that culminated to a plot similar to that of the 1985 Beirut car bombing the aftermath of which led to the last time...

It is the easternmost point (in terms of jurisdiction) and territory of the United States. What's the best answer to this question: is the us virgin islands part of the usa? Pick your answer from: - no - yes...A:","completion":"A: Yes, the US Virgin Islands is part of the USA. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which means that while it is not a state, it still falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is subject to U.S. federal laws. The USVI consists of several Caribbean islands, including Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, along with many smaller islands. Residents of the US Virgin Islands are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote for the U.S. President in the general elections, and the islands do not have full representation in the United States Congress. The people of the USVI do, however, elect a non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, who can participate in debates and vote in committee meetings but cannot vote on the final passage of bills. The USVI has a local government that operates under a constitution approved by the U.S. Congress. There is a governor who is the chief executive of the territory, a unicameral legislature with 15 members, and a judiciary that includes a superior court and a supreme court. While the legal system in the US Virgin Islands is based on U.S. federal law and the U.S. Constitution, the territory is allowed to have its territorial laws and regulations. In terms of economy, the US Virgin Islands relies heavily on tourism, with more than two million visitors annually contributing to its economy. Other significant industries include rum production, trade, and manufacturing. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of the territory, and English is the most widely spoken language, although Virgin Islands Creole is also spoken. It is important to note that while the US Virgin Islands is indeed part of the United States, it maintains a separate customs territory from the mainland U.S. This means that it has its customs regulations and duties for goods entering or leaving the territory. However, travelers from the US Virgin Islands to mainland U.S. do not need a passport, as the journey is considered domestic travel. In conclusion, the US Virgin Islands is part of the United States, albeit as an unincorporated territory. While it enjoys a degree of self-governance, it is subject to U.S. federal laws, its residents are U.S. citizens, and the territory is the easternmost point of U.S. jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did.

It is from Allah.’ And the chilling posts reveal they are advising them down to the smallest detail on how to prepare for travelling to the region – from where to get guns and bulletproof vests to what trainers they should bring and how to avoid being bitten by bugs at night. The revelations raise urgent questions for the security services over whether enough is being done to prevent the spread of radical Islamic ideology among British teenagers. Young British Muslims are now known to be among the IS terror squads besieging the area around Mount Sinjar where thousands of refugees are trapped, the Mail can reveal. Intelligence officers have identified UK nationals as being part of the fanatical IS army that has swept across northern Iraq, carrying out a horrifying catalogue of medieval war crimes. Scroll down for video. Before they fled: Jihadists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (circled) hand out food to the needy in Cardiff last year. Both have been tweeting about their involvement with IS while on the front line. The. British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Reyaad Khan and Nasser. Muthana, the 20-year-olds from Cardiff who notoriously featured in a. jihad recruitment video for the group. The former Catholic college students. have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from. across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of. whom have already been killed. Using Twitter, social media site Ask.fm and smartphone apps, the jihadists are posting disturbing updates on their progress. Uploads. have included pictures of mass executions, beheadings, child soldiers. and selfies with men captured and tied to railings in the oppressive. heat. A British girl who has gone to Syria also posted a picture of. herself in the area, wearing a niqab and with a gun by her side. Some of the British jihadists command followers to ‘make hijrah’ – an Arabic term meaning emigration. They boast about what weapons they are using and offer advice on how to get into Syria and where to buy guns. If those messaging them appear serious about joining IS, they send private messages on mobile apps Kik and Surespot, which they claim are encrypted and impossible for authorities to monitor. It is thought about 500 British nationals have travelled to the region. United Nations War Crimes investigators said they are monitoring Islamic State online postings. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment last night. Ask.fm and Kik were unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Surespot said: ‘Any technology has the potential for abuse by nefarious individuals. ‘For example, digital cameras can be used for child porn but they can also be used to take lovely pictures. Are we then to stop selling them? ‘In the same vein, are we supposed to give governments access to all of our private information?’ The Home Office said it is aware of the IS propaganda online and is working with social media companies to remove extremist material. A spokesman added: ‘We do not tolerate the existence of online terrorist and extremist propaganda. ‘We work with the internet industry to remove terrorist material hosted in the UK or overseas.’ One British fighter, Abu Farris, took to the website Ask.fm – criticised for failing to crack down on harmful content – to convince radicalised youths to join him. Here are some of his slang-filled posts from his question-and-answer session:. Q: Don’t you miss your mum? Why don’t you just be a British Muslim and live in peace? A: Of course I miss my mum, I’ll see her in jannah [paradise] if Allah accepts me. Regardless of how we feel, its obligatory. This is more important than my family. Q: Since u left have ur family been more understanding or confused? A: To be honest, my family think IS are extreme. They think I was brainwashed. By the grace of Allah I’m not upset. I know that if Allah accepts me I’ll intercede for them and show them who was right on judgment day. Q: I have a bad feeling I can’t hack it... A: Trust me, when ur here you will have ur brothers to talk to. Don’t be scared. 15-yr-olds can hack it bro, so why can’t you? Ask Allah for help. Q: How much British have you met over there? A: So many. Q: Would you advise people going over to learn Arabic first? A: You’ll pick it up here inshallah [God willing]. You can even study here. Q: I’m 18. Do you know any 18-year-old sisters from the UK? I think I am too young. A: I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young. Q: Do u find a spouse in advance? A: There are bros here that wanna get married and sisters out there that wanna get married. Just find a bro or a sis, thru friends or however. Q: Are there gun stores there? A: Yep, u can buy loads of stuff. Q: Are bulletproof vests hard to get where you are? Would a person be better buying it in Turkey and then crossing over with it? A: You can buy it here easily, like any random military store in Raqqah u’ll find it.. they’re like 100. Q: Do you use night vision goggles? A: Of course, we even have spy planes. Q: Are Nikes sufficient footwear? A: I brought one pair of Adidas high-tops. You’ll get what you need here. You won’t enter the battlefield unless ur kitted up and you have ammo etc. Q: Are there a lot of bugs there? Like if I’m sleeping, are they gonna crawl on me? Sorry if this is a weird question. May Allah reward you. A: Nope inshallah, you’ll be fine. Even if there was bugs, there’s those bug eliminators. It’s not bad, only thing is mosquitoes really. Q: Is there internet at your homes? A: Sometimes your house can be near an internet cafe so you can use internet from there. Q: Are there jobs to be an executioner, like when you capture kuffar [non-believers]? A: Yep. Q: How do you earn money? A: We get ‘pocket money’ to spend, to look after your wife, buy some clothes etc.. they give us what’s necessary. Q: Do I need to do a front-flip during training? Nope, training here isn’t as hard as u think. It’s more psychological training, like mentally training you.

OPTIONS: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","completion":"a). yes; The premise and the hypothesis very closely align each other in their meanings and implications. In the premise, \\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act,\\" suggests that Beresford is expressing the idea that unless Sir James Peel Edgerton is observed committing a wrongful action, there would be no valid reason to think him guilty. The hypothesis, \\"Beresford said that I would never believe in the guilt of Sir James Peel Edgerton unless he had been caught red-handed,\\" also aligns well with the statement from the premise. Here, being \\"caught red-handed\\" is equivalent to the concept of being \\"caught in the act\\" from the premise. Both phrases refer to the necessity of irrefutable evidence (such as catching someone in the middle of performing the wrongful action) to be convinced of Sir James Peel Edgerton's guilt. So, based on the premise provided, we can conclude the hypothesis: \\"Beresford said that I would never believe in the guilt of Sir James Peel Edgerton unless he had been caught red-handed,\\" is true.

Combine the x terms: -20x - 13x can be combined into a single term: -33x. So the equation becomes: -198 = -33x 2. Isolate the variable x: To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is -33. -198 / -33 = (-33x) / -33 3. Solve for x: Divide -198 by -33: -198 / -33 = 6 So the equation -198 = -33x becomes 6 = x. 4. Check the result: To double-check the correctness of the obtained result, substitute x with 6 back into the original equation: -198 = -20*(6) - 13*(6) -198 = -120 - 78 -198 = -198 Since the two sides of the equation match, the solution x=6 is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief Options: A. not enough information B. Because they may denuclearize C.

I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that \\"I, Robot\\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too). I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \\"retread\\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others). \\"I, Robot\\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice.

Here are the steps and justifications for this conclusion: Step 1: Identifying the cause of dead zones The main cause of dead zones in the ocean is the harmful entry of chemicals or particles, often resulting from disposing of waste and chemical fertilizers in rivers. These rivers then carry these pollutants to the ocean, where they contribute to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. Step 2: Evaluating the environmental practices of each country Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste, which is a major contributor to the creation of dead zones. On the other hand, Panama is eco-friendly and does not use their rivers for waste disposal. Step 3: Considering the hint provided The hint states that the quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.

Question: What instrument did Auguste Franchomme play?","completion":"Auguste Franchomme was a renowned cellist during the Romantic era and was closely associated with the famed composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin. Born in Lille, France in 1808, Auguste Joseph Franchomme became one of the leading cellists of his time. Franchomme performed the cello, which is a bowed string instrument known for its versatility and ability to cover a wide range of pitches. It is part of the violin family of instruments and is positioned between the violin and the double bass in terms of size and pitch range. In the given article, it is mentioned that Franchomme collaborated with Chopin in his last Paris concert in February 1848. During this concert, Franchomme played the cello alongside Chopin's piano accompaniment, showcasing their musical prowess together. Specifically, they performed three movements of Chopin's composition, the Cello Sonata Op. 65, which was written for cello and piano and is one of the few chamber music pieces by Chopin. Franchomme's skill and artistry on the cello brought him wide recognition. He was a sought-after performer and teacher, working with many other famous musicians of his time. Additionally, Franchomme was a composer in his own right and contributed to the cello repertoire with his own études, caprices, and other works.

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, while non-infectious diseases can be caused by genetic factors, lifestyle choices, or environmental factors, among others. In the case of influenza, the cause is a virus, which is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets. However, several other factors can affect an individual's susceptibility to infection and disease progression, including age, immune system function, and overall health. In contrast, non-infectious diseases are not contagious and are caused by a wide array of factors. For instance, genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis result from mutations in specific genes inherited from both parents. Lifestyle choices – such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and tobacco or alcohol consumption – can contribute to chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Environmental factors, such as exposure to pollutants or toxins, can also play a crucial role in the development of various diseases. It is also essential to consider that some diseases can be influenced by an interplay of multiple factors. For example, autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are thought to develop due to a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and immune system dysfunction. Therefore, while \\"uV\\" may refer to ultraviolet radiation (a type of electromagnetic radiation), it is not the correct answer to the question of what causes human disease because human diseases arise from complex multifactorial interactions. Influenza is one cause of human disease but far from the only cause. It is crucial to recognize the diverse factors affecting human health and the myriad ways these factors can combine to cause disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - They are unstable people. - They have terrible manners. - not enough information - They break the rules and do not care about the property of the writer Answer:","completion":"The writer most likely feels that the family living above them is unstable. While other options also apply, such as having terrible manners and breaking rules without caring about the writer's property, the description provided of the family's actions and behavior seem to point towards instability.

MARTIN MAKES A DISCOVERY OF SOME IMPORTANCE From Mr Moddle to Eden is an easy and natural transition. Mr Moddle, living in the atmosphere of Miss Pecksniff's love, dwelt (if he had but known it) in a terrestrial Paradise. The thriving city of Eden was also a terrestrial Paradise, upon the showing of its proprietors. The beautiful Miss Pecksniff might have been poetically described as a something too good for man in his fallen and degraded state. That was exactly the character of the thriving city of Eden, as poetically heightened by Zephaniah Scadder, General Choke, and other worthies; part and parcel of the talons of that great American Eagle, which is always airing itself sky-high in purest aether, and never, no never, never, tumbles down with draggled wings into the mud. When Mark Tapley, leaving Martin in the architectural and surveying offices, had effectually strengthened and encouraged his own spirits by the contemplation of their joint misfortunes, he proceeded, with new cheerfulness, in search of help; congratulating himself, as he went along, on the enviable position to which he had at last attained. 'I used to think, sometimes,' said Mr Tapley, 'as a desolate island would suit me, but I should only have had myself to provide for there, and being naturally a easy man to manage, there wouldn't have been much credit in THAT. Now here I've got my partner to take care on, and he's something like the sort of man for the purpose. I want a man as is always a-sliding off his legs when he ought to be on 'em. I want a man as is so low down in the school of life that he's always a-making figures of one in his copy-book, and can't get no further.

Write an article with the title: \\"U.S. is inching closer to energy independence as oil imports shrink\\" Article:","completion":"Title: U.S. Inching Closer to Energy Independence as Oil Imports Shrink Introduction: Driven by the combined efforts of increased domestic production and advancements in renewable energy, the United States has edged closer toward energy independence in recent years. One of the significant indicators for this progress is the steady decline in oil imports, making the U.S. less reliant on foreign markets. This article will explore the factors propelling this shift and the potential implications of this unprecedented move towards substantial American energy autonomy. The Surge in Domestic Oil Production: The U.S. energy landscape has experienced a resurgence in domestic production in the past decade, primarily driven by advances in technology. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up vast reserves of oil and natural gas in shale formations across the United States. The shale revolution has seen U.S. crude oil production increase from approximately 5 million barrels per day in 2008 to a record-breaking 12.8 million barrels per day in 2019. This growth has substantially reduced the country's dependence on oil imports from traditional suppliers such as OPEC nations and other global producers. The Impact of Renewables and Energy Efficiency: In addition to the boom in domestic oil production, the U.S. has made significant strides in developing renewable energy resources and improving energy efficiency. Wind and solar power capacity have grown exponentially over the past decade, contributing to a more diverse energy mix that reduces dependence on imported oil. Furthermore, investments in energy efficient technologies have helped curb demand for oil, as appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure require less energy to operate. The Declining Role of Oil Imports: As a result, oil imports have consistently shrunk over the past decade, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting that net imports of crude oil and petroleum products fell to 2.3 million barrels per day in 2019, from 11 million barrels per day in 2005. This marked a 79% reduction in oil imports in just 14 years. Additionally, the EIA predicts that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter by 2022. Implications for Energy Security and Foreign Policy: This trend toward energy independence has significant implications for U.S. energy security and foreign policy. As the country becomes less reliant on foreign oil, its vulnerability to fluctuations in global energy markets decreases. This newfound independence could mitigate the impact of geopolitical events on energy prices, dampening the repercussions of conflicts and economic crises on the nation's economy. Moreover, energy independence provides the U.S. with greater diplomatic leverage, as it no longer needs to depend on foreign suppliers with contentious political agendas. This shift could lead to a transformation of American foreign policy, with a focus on asserting national interests and promoting stability in strategic regions like the Middle East. Challenges and the Path Forward: Despite these promising developments, several challenges lie ahead in the quest for U.S. energy independence. The current administration's relaxed stance on environmental regulations and support for fossil fuel production have raised concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, achieving energy autonomy should not come at the expense of environmental sustainability. To maintain momentum in the transition toward energy independence, investments in renewable energy innovation, infrastructure, and electric vehicle production must continue. Furthermore, attention should be given to developing advanced energy storage systems to ensure the grid's reliability and resilience in the face of growing renewable energy sources. Conclusion: The United States' journey towards energy independence has been propelled by the surge in domestic oil production, the rapid growth of renewable energy sources, and gains in energy efficiency. As the nation continues to reduce its reliance on foreign oil imports, enhanced energy security and the potential for a more assertive foreign policy lie in the balance. To fully realize the benefits of this shift, continued investments in innovation, sustainability, and a diverse energy mix will be crucial to sustaining momentum in the push for American energy autonomy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Every year, it's the same thing – streets overcrowded, excessive noise, pollution from fireworks, and a bunch of accidents just waiting to happen. Steven: I completely agree. I'd love to have a quiet, meaningful celebration. Just picture it – a backyard barbecue with friends and family, people sharing stories of pride for our country, and maybe even a firecracker or two. You know, something small and intimate. Dave: That does sound nice – and way better than the current mess out there. But why can't we ever have that? What's preventing everything from being calmer and more organized? Brian: (shrugs) I guess it's just the surge of patriotism that takes people over, and it becomes a free-for-all. Plus, everyone has different ways of celebrating, so it's hard to find a unified and structured approach. Steven: Also, you can't forget that a lot of cities make a ton of money from tourists and visitors during July 4th, so for them, having huge events with fireworks and parades is a must. Dave: That's true, but I can't help but think we're losing sight of the true meaning of Independence Day. It's supposed to be a day to honor our nation's history and its founding principles. Instead, it's turned into a full-blown commercial event. Brian: You're right; it's a shame that people focus more on the superficial aspects, like fireworks and parties, instead of truly appreciating the significance of the day. Scene 2: A backyard barbecue, the very next year (Steven, Dave, and Brian decided to get together and have a quiet, meaningful celebration with their friends and family) Steven: (grilling burgers) You know, guys, I'm really glad we decided to do this. It's so much more enjoyable than the chaos outside. Dave: I agree, Steven. Swapping stories about our ancestors' contributions to this country and the spirited debates we've had today about our core values – that's what Independence Day is meant to be about. Brian: It's nice to see that we all wish to celebrate in our own way. Cheers to keeping the spirit of July 4th alive without losing our sanity in the chaos. (Scene ends as the group enjoys their burgers and continues to engage in meaningful conversation in the peaceful backyard.) In this dialogue, Dave expresses his concerns about the disordered and chaotic nature of Independence Day celebrations. Steven and Brian agree, and they all wish for a more organized, meaningful way to celebrate the holiday. The following year, they experience a quieter, more purposeful gathering where they engage in genuine conversations about their country's history and values."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first part of the book delves into why Iraq was chosen and all of the war planning that took place. The second part deals with the invasion itself, the battles and troop movements. The last part touches on the post regime collapse issues and the counterinsurgency that followed. One of the things about the book that I greatly appreciated was the maps. There were about 17 maps and one organizational chart in all at the front of the book which aided me greatly throughout the reading. For anyone who wants a comprehensive view of the lead up to and initial invasion, I would highly recommend reading this book, and then perhaps supplementing it with books like Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad and Ambush Alley: The Most Extraordinary Battle of the Iraq War to get an even deeper understanding on two of the battles that this book discusses Is this product review negative?

During Easter; Q: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

The couple's taciturn grounds man Peter (Al Cliver) is happy enough looking after the slavering pack of dogs the couple own. But the maid Maria (Carla Cassola) is becoming more and more suspicious of her sinister employers that they are hiding something. Sure enough, she discovers the dead bodies of a money-grabbing nephew (Paolo Bernardi) and his wife (Francesco De Rose) lying preserved in open coffins in the wine cellar. Maria is gorily killed by the elderly Sarah in the greenhouse the next morning while announcing her plans to quit.Meanwhile, three hoodlums, Diana (Karina Huff), Tony (Keith Van Hoven) and Paul (Peter Hintz) are driving through the area and decide to rob the old couple's house after receiving a tip-off from a grocery store owner in a nearby town about the wealth it supposedly contains and the decrepitude of the owners. That evening, Diana cunningly talks her way into the household by pretending that her car has broken down nearby and asks to use the phone. Soon, the phone lines are cut by her male accomplices and they force entry through an open window. Their plans to rob the old couple go badly wrong when Peter intervenes with his shotgun. A bloodbath ensues with Sarah accidentally getting shot, Peter getting killed by Paul, and Victor attacks Tony, forcing Diana to shoot him dead. The young trio are horrified by this turn of events, but decide to bundle the bodies away in a cupboard.At first the dazed criminals fail to notice what effect the mayhem has had on all the clocks in the house. Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed. When they do notice, they try to leave, but are trapped indoors by the Dobermans let loose to prowl the grounds.

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.

One of the country’s most popular exports, the greasy rib-sticker with ties to Quebec (and really late nights) will be spiffed up and scaled back in the hands of White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford. Her more formal take on the fast food involves shavings of smoked duck and cheese curds finished with red wine gravy and served on delicate wafer fries: a one-bite canapé. [Local chef add new flavors to poutine, Canada’s comfort food] No sooner was the menu announced than the Twitterverse lit up with reactions from America’s neighbors to the north, notoriously skeptical of outside interpretations of such an iconic dish. “With real cheese curds or no? THIS IS IMPORTANT!” tweeted the Globe and Mail’s Ann Hui. Otherwise, the menu, relying on American ingredients from sea to shining sea, played it fairly straight. If one of the points of breaking bread with another country is to underscore shared values, this state dinner plans to do its duty. As Comerford put it at a preview Wednesday afternoon, “We share a lot of commonality in terms of ingredients. So it’s not a stretch for us to do something wonderful.” Spring is checked off in practically every bite listed for the first course, a “casserole” featuring baked Alaskan halibut, asparagus, chanterelles and herbed butter in individual tureens. The second course, a composed salad, sounds like a recipe borrowed from one of the trendy Washington restaurants that first lady Michelle Obama favors. The most fashion-forward of the courses, it will incorporate slivers of apricots roasted with ginger and cardamom and arranged with crystal lettuce, along with what a press release described as “young” arugula and “variegated” spinach. Garnishing the greens: pine nut crisps and shaved Appalachian cheese from Galax, Va. The main course is a work horse featuring baby lamb chops, creamy garlicky baked potatoes and a fricassee of spring vegetables. [Parsing the French state dinner menu: Choices reflect trends, standbys] One of the three wines poured for the evening, the 2013 Pence Ranch chardonnay, has a D.C. connection. Sashi Moorman, the winery’s consultant, worked in Washington with restaurateur Peter Pastan at Obelisk before going on to become one of the hottest winemakers in Santa Barbara County. For the dessert of maple pecan cake with butterscotch swirl ice cream, it will be New England, not Canadian, maple syrup; White House pastry chef Susan Morrison attributed the selection to “availability.” Indeed, one of the few shout-outs to Canada, beyond the poutine, is the mere splash of Canadian whisky on the lamb. Three pastry cooks spent a full week making the last impression, “A View from the Mountain Top”: 22 trays of sweet little bears, tiny trees, golf-ball-size snowballs, golden raisin tarts — French-Canadians know the latter as tarte à la farlouche — and more displayed against a postcard-size photograph of the Rocky Mountains. Together with the riff on poutine, the choice seems like a wink to an ally’s youth, vigor and interests.

I appreciate this very much. I will order again from this seller. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review initially starts off as negative, but ultimately shifts to a positive tone by the end of the review. At the beginning of the review, the customer states that they never received the product after placing their order and subsequently left a poor review. This clearly indicates a negative tone, as the customer encountered an unsatisfactory and frustrating experience. The mention of the previous negative review further emphasizes dissatisfaction with their initial transaction. However, the tone of the review changes as it progresses. The customer acknowledges the seller's prompt attention to their concern and expresses their appreciation when a second order was sent without delay. This demonstrates a shift to a positive tone, as the customer believes the seller took their complaint seriously and made an effort to rectify the situation to their satisfaction. The customer's sentiment turns positive as their issue was addressed efficiently and effectively. By the end of the review, the customer expresses their willingness to order again from the seller, further reinforcing the overall positive tone. Although their initial experience was less than desirable, the seller's attentive customer service ultimately wins over the disappointed buyer, resulting in a predominantly positive tone for the review.

These approaches allow one to draw shapes and figures in innovative ways. One such technique is by drawing \\"outside the box\\". The approach explained below provides a step-by-step guide to recreate a diagram using this method. This article aims to explain the process and highlight the benefits of the \\"Outside the Box\\" method in drawing. Unraveling the \\"Outside the Box\\" Method: At its core, the \\"Outside the Box\\" method offers a more unconventional route to drawing. For those looking for an alternative approach, this technique will prove to be an interesting challenge. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the \\"Outside the Box\\" method: 1. Begin at the top right dot: As described, the starting point for this method is the top right dot within the box. This dot will be the foundation from which the entire diagram will be constructed. 2. Move the pen back to the center dot on the same line: Once the top right dot has been identified, the next step is to connect this dot to the center dot on the same line. This movement contributes to the formation of the first portion of the diagram. 3. Move the pen to the center dot and then left and right to make the third line, returning to the center dot: Next, position your pen at the center dot where the first line ended. From this point, draw a horizontal line extending towards the left and right end of the box, thereby creating a third line. Now, return the pen to the center dot for the next movement. 4. Extend the second line down to the middle dot on the bottom: Continuing from the center dot, draw a vertical line downwards, ending at the middle dot on the bottom of the box. This extension forms the second part of the diagram. 5. Move the pen left and right to complete the fourth line on the bottom: Lastly, from the middle bottom dot, draw a horizontal line extending towards the left and right ends of the box. This movement completes the final portion of the diagram. Benefits of the \\"Outside the Box\\" Method: The method's particular process of drawing highlights a sequence to follow when constructing diagrams. The \\"Outside the Box\\" technique offers several benefits, including: - Enhancing creativity through an unconventional method - Training the mind to view shapes and figures in a different light - Providing a sense of accomplishment from mastering a new technique Conclusion: The \\"Outside the Box\\" method is an inventive approach to drawing, providing a fresh perspective for individuals who appreciate the artistic process. By following the step-by-step guidelines discussed in this article, users can explore alternative ways of thinking about shapes and figures. Embracing this unconventional drawing technique could inspire a newfound appreciation for art and design and stimulate creativity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer. Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the last names of the people who discover Elspeth is lonely are Teasdale and Corder.

Article: Many years ago in a small German town, a Jewish businessman had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to the moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me!\\" she said. \\"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years?

I had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 Moving Picture Festival In Birmingham, Alabama. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening. When I think of the films that are shown at festivals, I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. There's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making.

The writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. There is nothing typically independent about this film. As an aspiring director, I am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. This is one of those films. As I watched The Big Bad Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. When a movie makes me feel like that, I know it's really good. This is the first feature-length project from Ishai Setton and I found myself wishing that It had been my project.

She has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. That's a gift.

Summarize this article: This is a good starting number for beginning your own superworm colony. You can purchase live superworm larvae online or from a pet supply store in your area. If you purchase superworms online, check to make sure that the worms you are buying are shipped live. You can use plastic film canisters, partitioned craft boxes, condiment cups, or empty plastic cosmetic jars for this purpose. Poke or drill a small hole in the lid of each container so that your superworms can breathe. It’s important to store your pupating superworms in their own containers so that adults and other larvae won’t nibble on them while they mature. Isolating the superworms in dark containers will also stimulate the pupation process, which could otherwise take up to 5 months to occur naturally. Wheat bran or oatmeal will work well for this purpose. Use just enough to cover the bottom of the container. The substrate will serve as both bedding and a source of nourishment for the superworm larvae. There’s no need to put any additional food in the containers for the superworm larvae. Some breeders recommend against using substrate altogether, since any source of food can slow down the pupating process. If you choose to leave out the substrate, make sure the larvae are already full size (about 2 inches (51 mm) long) before isolating them. Once the superworms and substrate are in their containers, put the containers in a dark area, such as a drawer or cabinet. Make sure that the storage area is warm, preferably around 80 °F (27 °C). It is especially important to keep your superworms in a dark place if you are using transparent or translucent containers, such as glass jars or clear plastic condiment cups. Peek in on your superworm larvae occasionally over the next week to 10 days. After a few days, you should notice that most of your superworms have curled up into a “c” or “e” shape. By the end of a week or so, they should begin to transform into “alien”-looking pupae, with a shorter, cream-colored body and ridges that will eventually become legs. Any larvae that are stiff and straight or have turned dark in color are probably dead. Discard any dead larvae and replace them with live ones. Check the pupae occasionally to look for signs that they are maturing, such as darkening of the legs. It will take about 2 more weeks for the pupae to transform into beetles. Continue to store the pupae in separate containers until they mature. If you put the pupae together, the beetles that mature first might snack on the other pupae. Summary:","completion":"To start your own superworm colony, purchase live superworm larvae online or from a pet supply store. Use containers like plastic film canisters or partitioned craft boxes with small air holes to house each superworm separately to prevent nibbling by other larvae. Isolating them in dark containers speeds up the pupation process. Use wheat bran or oatmeal as a substrate for bedding and nourishment, but do not add extra food. Place the containers in a warm, dark area and check on the larvae periodically. Over time, they will transform into pupae and eventually beetles. Discard dead larvae and continue to store the pupae separately until they fully mature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Solve this instance: Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images, where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient, hard sample mining is usually employed, with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However, the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space, where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper, we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit, which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets, its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.

Rambus Inc. shot up almost 33 percent , making it the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq .","completion":"No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning due to a key difference in the specifics of the percentage increase being depicted. In the first sentence, it's stated that Rambus Inc., a company on the NASDAQ stock exchange (denoted by its ticker symbol RMBS), experienced an increase or 'shot up' in its stock value by 38 percent. This considerable increase labels it as the 'the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq', implying that out of all the various companies trading under the NASDAQ exchange, Rambus Inc. had the most significant boost in percentage on that particular day or time period. On the contrary, the second sentence illustrates that Rambus Inc.'s stock value surged by almost 33 percent. Despite the fact that this still makes it the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, the intensity of the rise in stock value isn't the same as the one depicted in the first sentence. While both sentences relate that Rambus Inc. was the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, the specific percentage of the increase differs between the two sentences. The first sentence mentions a 38 percent increase while the second refers to a close to 33 percent. Even though both figures show a substantial rise signifying a positive market performance, the disparity between 38 percent and 33 percent is notable and thus the two sentences don't convey the same meaning. Normally, an investor would be much more interested in a 38% gain than a 33% gain. The difference in those 5 percentage points could mean a significant increase in profits depending on the size of the initial investment. So, the key point of difference here is the intensity or degree of gain, which carries a high level of significance in the world of stocks and investments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: 2. OkCupid works by asking people a series of questions about their personality then matching similar people with similar answers using an algorithm. You are given a percentage match for each eligible partner. But the chances of being matched with someone who’s perfect for you (or whom you like) is quite slim. Out of the thousands of personality questions you might get asked, what if there was a way to find out which questions mattered to the women he might be interested in and just answer those? ||||| Mathematician Chris McKinlay hacked OKCupid to find the girl of his dreams. Emily Shur Chris McKinlay was folded into a cramped fifth-floor cubicle in UCLA’s math sciences building, lit by a single bulb and the glow from his monitor. It was 3 in the morn­ing, the optimal time to squeeze cycles out of the supercomputer in Colorado that he was using for his PhD dissertation. (The subject: large-scale data processing and parallel numerical methods.) While the computer chugged, he clicked open a second window to check his OkCupid inbox. McKinlay, a lanky 35-year-old with tousled hair, was one of about 40 million Americans looking for romance through websites like Match.com, J-Date, and e-Harmony, and he’d been searching in vain since his last breakup nine months earlier. He’d sent dozens of cutesy introductory messages to women touted as potential matches by OkCupid’s algorithms. Most were ignored; he’d gone on a total of six first dates. On that early morning in June 2012, his compiler crunching out machine code in one window, his forlorn dating profile sitting idle in the other, it dawned on him that he was doing it wrong. He’d been approaching online matchmaking like any other user. Instead, he realized, he should be dating like a mathematician. OkCupid was founded by Harvard math majors in 2004, and it first caught daters’ attention because of its computational approach to matchmaking. Members answer droves of multiple-choice survey questions on everything from politics, religion, and family to love, sex, and smartphones. On average, respondents select 350 questions from a pool of thousands—“Which of the following is most likely to draw you to a movie?” or “How important is religion/God in your life?” For each, the user records an answer, specifies which responses they’d find acceptable in a mate, and rates how important the question is to them on a five-point scale from “irrelevant” to “mandatory.” OkCupid’s matching engine uses that data to calculate a couple’s compatibility. The closer to 100 percent—mathematical soul mate—the better. But mathematically, McKinlay’s compatibility with women in Los Angeles was abysmal. OkCupid’s algorithms use only the questions that both potential matches decide to answer, and the match questions McKinlay had chosen—more or less at random—had proven unpopular. When he scrolled through his matches, fewer than 100 women would appear above the 90 percent compatibility mark. And that was in a city containing some 2 million women (approximately 80,000 of them on OkCupid). On a site where compatibility equals visibility, he was practically a ghost. He realized he’d have to boost that number. If, through statistical sampling, McKinlay could ascertain which questions mattered to the kind of women he liked, he could construct a new profile that honestly answered those questions and ignored the rest. He could match every woman in LA who might be right for him, and none that weren’t. Chris McKinlay used Python scripts to riffle through hundreds of OkCupid survey questions. He then sorted female daters into seven clusters, like “Diverse” and “Mindful,” each with distinct characteristics. Maurico Alejo Even for a mathematician, McKinlay is unusual. Raised in a Boston suburb, he graduated from Middlebury College in 2001 with a degree in Chinese. In August of that year he took a part-time job in New York translating Chinese into English for a company on the 91st floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center. The towers fell five weeks later. (McKinlay wasn’t due at the office until 2 o’clock that day. He was asleep when the first plane hit the north tower at 8:46 am.) “After that I asked myself what I really wanted to be doing,” he says. A friend at Columbia recruited him into an offshoot of MIT’s famed professional blackjack team, and he spent the next few years bouncing between New York and Las Vegas, counting cards and earning up to 60,000 a year. The experience kindled his interest in applied math, ultimately inspiring him to earn a master’s and then a PhD in the field. “They were capable of using mathema­tics in lots of different situations,” he says. “They could see some new game—like Three Card Pai Gow Poker—then go home, write some code, and come up with a strategy to beat it.” Now he’d do the same for love. First he’d need data. While his dissertation work continued to run on the side, he set up 12 fake OkCupid accounts and wrote a Python script to manage them. The script would search his target demographic (heterosexual and bisexual women between the ages of 25 and 45), visit their pages, and scrape their profiles for every scrap of available information: ethnicity, height, smoker or nonsmoker, astrological sign—“all that crap,” he says. To find the survey answers, he had to do a bit of extra sleuthing. OkCupid lets users see the responses of others, but only to questions they’ve answered themselves. McKinlay set up his bots to simply answer each question randomly—he wasn’t using the dummy profiles to attract any of the women, so the answers didn’t mat­ter—then scooped the women’s answers into a database. McKinlay watched with satisfaction as his bots purred along. Then, after about a thousand profiles were collected, he hit his first roadblock. OkCupid has a system in place to prevent exactly this kind of data harvesting: It can spot rapid-fire use easily. One by one, his bots started getting banned. He would have to train them to act human. He turned to his friend Sam Torrisi, a neuroscientist who’d recently taught McKinlay music theory in exchange for advanced math lessons. Torrisi was also on OkCupid, and he agreed to install spyware on his computer to monitor his use of the site. With the data in hand, McKinlay programmed his bots to simulate Torrisi’s click-rates and typing speed. He brought in a second computer from home and plugged it into the math department’s broadband line so it could run uninterrupted 24 hours a day. After three weeks he’d harvested 6 million questions and answers from 20,000 women all over the country. McKinlay’s dissertation was relegated to a side project as he dove into the data. He was already sleeping in his cubicle most nights. Now he gave up his apartment entirely and moved into the dingy beige cell, laying a thin mattress across his desk when it was time to sleep. For McKinlay’s plan to work, he’d have to find a pattern in the survey data—a way to roughly group the women according to their similarities. The breakthrough came when he coded up a modified Bell Labs algorithm called K-Modes. First used in 1998 to analyze diseased soybean crops, it takes categorical data and clumps it like the colored wax swimming in a Lava Lamp. With some fine-tuning he could adjust the viscosity of the results, thinning it into a slick or coagulating it into a single, solid glob. He played with the dial and found a natural resting point where the 20,000 women clumped into seven statistically distinct clusters based on their questions and answers. “I was ecstatic,” he says. “That was the high point of June.” He retasked his bots to gather another sample: 5,000 women in Los Angeles and San Francisco who’d logged on to OkCupid in the past month. Another pass through K-Modes confirmed that they clustered in a similar way. His statistical sampling had worked. Now he just had to decide which cluster best suited him. He checked out some profiles from each. One cluster was too young, two were too old, another was too Christian. But he lingered over a cluster dominated by women in their mid-twenties who looked like indie types, musicians and artists. This was the golden cluster. The haystack in which he’d find his needle. Somewhere within, he’d find true love. Actually, a neighboring cluster looked pretty cool too—slightly older women who held professional creative jobs, like editors and designers. He decided to go for both. He’d set up two profiles and optimize one for the A group and one for the B group. He text-mined the two clusters to learn what interested them; teaching turned out to be a popular topic, so he wrote a bio that emphasized his work as a math professor. The important part, though, would be the survey. He picked out the 500 questions that were most popular with both clusters. He’d already decided he would fill out his answers honestly—he didn’t want to build his future relationship on a foundation of computer-generated lies. But he’d let his computer figure out how much importance to assign each question, using a machine-learning algorithm called adaptive boosting to derive the best weightings. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Mathematician Chris McKinlay hacked OkCupid to find his ideal partner by using algorithms to analyze data gathered from the dating site's multiple-choice survey questions.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of\\" is \\"allow growth\\", given that some viruses have an envelope of fats and proteins? A:","completion":"In light of the provided information, stating that some viruses have an envelope comprised of fats and proteins, the answer \\"allow growth\\" would not be the correct response to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of.\\" The most accurate answer, as you mentioned, would be that some viruses have an envelope made up of fats (lipids) and proteins. To understand why this is the appropriate response, we must first delve into the basic structure of viruses and the role of the envelope in their life cycle. A virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of living host organisms. Viruses are composed of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, encased in a protein coat known as a capsid. Some viruses possess an additional layer surrounding the capsid, referred to as an envelope. The viral envelope is derived from the host cell's membrane during the process of viral replication, and therefore, it integrates lipids (fats) and proteins from the host. The presence of an envelope in a virus is not related to promoting growth, as viruses do not grow or reproduce in the same way as living organisms. Instead, the envelope serves a variety of functions that facilitate the infection process in viruses: 1. Host cell recognition: The envelope proteins often serve as viral attachment glycoproteins, which are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific receptors on the surface of a host cell. This interaction enables the virus to enter the cell and initiate the infection. 2. Virus entry: Some enveloped viruses can enter the host cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. This process delivers the viral genome into the cell, making it available for replication. 3. Evasion of host immune response: The envelope, being acquired from the host cell membrane, may help the virus remain undetected by the host's immune system, as it can resemble self-molecules and evade the immune defenses. 4. Release of progeny viruses: Upon viral replication within a host cell, the newly formed viral particles require release from the cell to infect other cells or hosts. The envelope assists in this process by budding off the host cell membrane, which in turn allows the virus to exit without causing immediate cell lysis (rupture of the cell). In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of\\" is not \\"allow growth\\" but rather \\"fats and proteins.\\" The viral envelope, made up of lipids and proteins derived from the host cell, aids in host cell recognition, virus entry, immune evasion, and release of new viral particles, rather than promoting growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to further elaborate on this issue, it's important to dive deeper and examine the compatibility of the various components and potential solutions to this problem. To begin with, let's get a better understanding of each component mentioned: 1. 425W Power Supply: A 425-Watt power supply is designed to provide adequate power to all the components within a computer system. The wattage requirement of a system is primarily determined by the processor, graphics cards, and other hardware components that may require a significant amount of power. 2. 90 percent efficiency: This refers to the efficiency of the power supply unit (PSU) in terms of converting the AC power from the wall socket to usable DC power for the components. A higher efficiency PSU results in less wasted energy as heat and reduces the overall power consumption of your system. 3. DDR3 RDIMM Memory: DDR3 is a type of memory technology used for Random Access Memory (RAM) modules. RDIMM, or Registered DIMM, is a more advanced form of DDR3 memory that includes a hardware register between the DRAM modules and the memory controller. It is typically used in servers and workstations where stability and reliability are crucial, as the additional register helps detect and correct errors. Now, let's address potential compatibility issues: The main compatibility concern here is the use of DDR3 RDIMM memory with the specified power supply and efficiency. In general, the incompatibility of a specific component would not be directly related to the power supply and its efficiency. DDR3 RDIMM memory modules, being primarily designed for servers and workstations, might not be compatible with a regular desktop motherboard. It's important to verify the compatibility of your motherboard with RDIMM memory and ensure it supports this type of memory. Instead, you might need to use a non-registered DDR3 memory, like UDIMM (Unbuffered DIMM), which is more common in consumer-grade systems. Another factor to consider is the overall power consumption of the components, including the DDR3 RDIMM memory modules. While it's unlikely that the memory modules would significantly impact the power requirements, it's good practice to calculate the total power consumption of your system and make sure the 425W power supply is sufficient to cater to all the components. In conclusion, the compatibility issue in this scenario is likely due to the use of DDR3 RDIMM memory with a desktop motherboard that may not support it. To resolve this problem, verify your motherboard's compatibility with RDIMM memory or opt for a UDIMM memory module instead. Additionally, ensure that the power supply is adequate to cater to all the components in your system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away.

Article: Scientists are making new studies of color and its effects on our health. They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies. Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again. Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. Question: After reading the passage we can conclude that _ .

A:","completion":"No, the answer \\"voltage\\" is not correct in the context of the question \\"what makes temperature vary?\\" when referring to seasonal temperature variations. Instead, temperature variations are primarily due to the Earth's axial tilt, the angle of sunlight, and the resulting distribution of solar energy. Earth's axial tilt, at approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the planet to experience different amounts of sunlight in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres depending on the time of year. During the summer months, the Earth's tilt causes the sun's rays to strike the Earth's surface more directly, resulting in higher temperatures. Conversely, in the winter, the tilt causes sunlight to strike the Earth at a sharper angle, which results in less solar energy being absorbed by the surface and leads to lower temperatures. Additionally, other factors that influence temperature variations include geographical location, elevation, ocean currents, and local weather patterns. In the field of electronics, voltage can create heat through the resistance of components, which can cause temperature variations.

Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies.

Answer the above question based on the context below: André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.

A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by a £34.5million global fraud scam, a court heard today. ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport, 46, hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion, and boasted of befriending A list celebrities and royalty including supermodel Kate Moss, and Princes William and Harry. But Fast Eddie, as he was known to his friends, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped 51 victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes. 'Fast Eddie': Edward Davenport pictured with his Thai girlfriend Monthira Sanan-Ua. A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by global fraud made £34.5million from the scam. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport’s scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence. Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as India, Canada and Dubai. Davenport, who was sentenced to seven and a half years behind bars, was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the beginning of a three week confiscation hearing. Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said Davenport is thought to have made £34.5m gained through his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit from his enterprises during the six year con, between 2003 and 2009. But Davenport will argue he should only pay back £8m of his criminal proceeds. ‘The prosecution figure of over £34m arises from the application of three statutory assumptions in the proceeds of crime act’, said Mr Mayo. ‘The figure under the first assumption of £17.5m is made up principally of money transferred into bank accounts during that six year period. ‘We assume any of the property held by the defendant at any time after the date of conviction, May 19, 2011, was obtained by him as a result of general criminal conduct. ‘That amounts to £12.5m.’ He said the total amount Davenport is thought to have made is comprised of inflation in the value of money, and profit from other property deals. Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco. He lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. Central to the confiscation hearing will be the mansion, at 33 Portland Place, which he bought for £3.9m from the Sierra Leone government. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Mr Mayo said the prosecution believe the mansion, valued at £10m, was obtained through fraud, whereas Davenport’s legal team will argue it was bought legally. 'Thirty Three Portland Place is a substantial property in central London, the freehold reversion of the premises was bought by Edward Davenport on October 31, 2005, for a total purchase price of £3,937,000’, he said. ‘Has Edward Davenport succeeded in convincing that it was not correct to make the statutory assumption that 33 Portland Place represents proceeds of general criminal conduct? ‘Has Edward Davenport shown there would be a serious risk of injustice if that assumption were made?’ Mr Mayo added both defence and prosecution agree Davenport currently has £14m of assets which are available for confiscation. The conman’s defence team argue he should repay £8m, and assert that the London mansion should not be part of proceedings. They will argue £6m should be seized from his Swiss and Monaco bank accounts, just £0.8m in property assets, and £97,000 from a separate property deal. Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in 1999 for £3.9m while the country was embroiled in civil war. Davenport’s web page boasted: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’ It suggested that Davenport was a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’ Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova, Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne. One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000 in up-front fees. She told his trial: ‘He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny. ‘It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common conman. He fully deserves his sentence.’ He turned out in Savile Row suits for his trial, but is now undergoing dialysis treatment three times a week when the court will not sit.

Please answer this question: How many dwarf planets are there in our solar system?","completion":"As of now, there are five officially recognized dwarf planets in our solar system. It's important to keep in mind that this number is subject to change as our knowledge and understanding of celestial bodies evolve over time. Also, keep in mind that there could still be undiscovered dwarf planets lurking out there. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the organization responsible for the classification of celestial bodies, and they established the definition of a dwarf planet in 2006. According to the IAU, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that: 1. Orbits the Sun. 2. Has sufficient mass to assume a round or nearly round shape due to its own gravity. 3. Has not cleared its orbit of other debris. 4. Is not a satellite (moon) of another celestial body. Here is a brief description of the five recognized dwarf planets: 1. Pluto: Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially classified as the ninth planet. However, in 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for planets, which led to Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet. It is located in the Kuiper Belt, an area beyond Neptune's orbit that is home to numerous small celestial bodies. Pluto takes approximately 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun and has a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles). 2. Eris: Discovered in 2005, Eris is the largest known dwarf planet with a diameter of approximately 2,326 kilometers (1,445 miles). Its discovery led to the debate that resulted in the IAU's new definition of a planet and the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. Eris is located in a region of space called the scattered disk, beyond the Kuiper Belt. It has an extremely elliptical orbit that takes about 558 Earth years to complete. 3. Haumea: Discovered in 2004, Haumea is an elongated, egg-shaped dwarf planet with dimensions of about 1,960 x 1,518 x 996 kilometers (1,218 x 944 x 619 miles). It is located in the Kuiper Belt and takes around 284 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Haumea has two known moons, Hi'iaka and Namaka, and has a unique fast rotation, completing one spin in just under four Earth hours. 4. Makemake: Discovered in 2005, Makemake is another Kuiper Belt resident with an approximate diameter of 1,430 kilometers (889 miles). It has one known moon, named S/2015 (136472) 1 or MK2, and it takes about 310 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun. 5. Ceres: Discovered in 1801, Ceres was initially classified as a planet but was later reclassified as an asteroid. It is the largest object in the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was eventually reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the IAU established the new criteria. It has a diameter of about 590 miles (940 kilometers) and takes approximately 4.6 Earth years to orbit the Sun. In addition to these recognized dwarf planets, there are numerous other celestial bodies that might be classified as dwarf planets in the future. It is estimated that there could be hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of potential dwarf planets residing in various regions of our solar system, waiting to be discovered and classified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The number of rings in a tree trunk can be used to estimate the age of the tree, and age of Pine trees (AGE) in years. Given these facts, what unit of time can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk among the following options: - hours - decades - months - H20 - Joules - DNA - years - seasons Answer:","completion":"The unit of time that can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk to determine the age of a tree, particularly Pine trees, is years. Each ring in the tree trunk represents a full year of the tree's growth. This annual growth cycle is marked by a noticeable change in the wood's appearance, forming a ring. Delving deeper, a tree adds a new layer of growth to its trunk every year. These new layers can be observed as annual growth rings. In temperate regions, trees typically undergo two growth periods in a year. The initial growth period occurs in spring, when the tree's growth is fastest and the wood is lighter in color. During this period, the cells are larger and less dense, forming the earlywood or springwood. In summer, the growth rate slows down and the wood formed is darker and more dense, which is known as latewood or summerwood. The transition from one growth period to another results in the formation of annual rings. Upon taking a cross-section of the tree trunk, these annual rings are visible and can be counted to estimate the tree's age. This method of determining the tree's age is called dendrochronology. One annual ring typically represents one year of growth in the life of the tree. So, by counting the total number of rings present in the trunk, we can estimate the tree's age in years. Hence, among all the given units of time - hours, decades, months, H20, Joules, DNA, years, and seasons - the most accurate unit for estimating the age of a tree using the rings in its trunk is years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose the next sentence.(CNN) -- Commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe, Asia and elsewhere are detouring away from the volatile region in light of Thursday's suspicious crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that U.S. airlines had voluntarily agreed not to operate in airspace near the Russian-Ukraine border. Later, the FAA issued a notice prohibiting U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice. The restricted area includes the Dnepropetrovsk and Simferopol Flight Information Regions. The European Aviation Safety Agency and intergovernmental aviation organization Eurocontrol also warned against flying in these areas.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during hunting happens, how will it affect more. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of hunting during a forest fire has both direct and indirect effects on the already existing process mentioned. The process described includes the destruction of habitat, change in predator-prey dynamics, bird migration, and changes in water temperature affecting aquatic life. Let's analyze the effects of hunting during this scenario: 1. Direct Effect on Habitat Destruction: While the forest fire is responsible for destroying the habitat, adding hunting in this process accelerates habitat destruction. For instance, if hunters use off-road vehicles or create makeshift paths to access deeper forest areas, it might result in the destruction of the unburned areas. 2. Direct Effect on Predator-Prey Dynamics: Hunting during this time may further impact the predator-prey dynamics. Hunters may target specific species, which can affect existing food chain within the forest. If hunters target predators, the preys might experience an initial population spike, followed by shortage of food and habitat. On the other hand, if hunters focus on prey species, the predators will have even more trouble finding their food, which may lead to decreased predator population in the long run. 3. Indirect Effect on Bird Migration: The hunting activities may exacerbate bird displacement caused by the forest fire. The noise and disturbance created by hunters may force the birds to fly further away or alter their original migration patterns. This can create a domino effect on the ecosystems in areas where the birds eventually end up. Additionally, if hunters target birds during this turmoil, bird populations may face a decline more severe than just from the forest fire. 4. Indirect Effect on Water Temperature and Aquatic Life: Although hunting itself may not directly affect water temperature, its indirect consequences on aquatic life could be significant. The increased human activity near water sources might cause an alteration in water quality due to increased waste or debris. Moreover, if hunters target fish or other aquatic organisms, it can disrupt the balance of aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, the perturbation of hunting during a forest fire has both direct and indirect effects on the existing process of habitat destruction, predator-prey dynamics, bird migration, and aquatic life. Introducing hunting during a forest fire increases the detrimental effects on the ecosystem and can further harm the already vulnerable wildlife populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides.

Background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Paragraph: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases?

As food is pushed along, it undergoes digestion. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work! Question: \\"What is mechanical digestion?\\" Answer: \\"Occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks, done by chewing\\" Is this answer correct? Select from: [+] no; [+] yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"[+] yes; The answer is correct because mechanical digestion is the process of physically breaking down food into smaller pieces. This happens when you chew your food with your teeth, and also in your stomach when the muscles contract to mix and break down food. This is different from chemical digestion, which involves breaking down food with enzymes and other chemicals into nutrients that can be absorbed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: What causes fear in skating? Options: - injuries - increased heart rate - might fall - can't stop - move fast Explain why a human would choose \\"might fall\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human might choose \\"might fall\\" as the answer to the question \\"What causes fear in skating?\\" because it is a common and relatable concern for many people. Step 1: Analyzing the options. First, let's look at the available options: - injuries: a valid concern, but not the direct cause of fear. It's more of a consequence of falling. - increased heart rate: a physiological response to fear or exercise, not the cause of fear itself. - might fall: the possibility of losing balance and experiencing a fall while skating. - can't stop: closely related to losing control, but not necessarily the primary reason for fear. - move fast: speed may be thrilling for some and intimidating for others, but it isn't the main cause of fear for most skaters. Step 2: Identifying the primary cause of fear. When learning or engaging in a new activity such as skating, the most common fear among people is the potential for falling. Falling can lead to embarrassment or physical injury, which in turn could impact one's confidence and willingness to continue learning or participating in the activity. Step 3: Understanding the human perspective. From a human perspective, this fear may stem from the lack of experience or confidence in one's own balance and skill. The innate drive for self-preservation also plays a role in this, as people instinctively avoid situations that have a potential for harm. Step 4: Justifying the choice. With these considerations in mind, \\"might fall\\" is an understandable and relatable answer to why fear arises in skating. It directly addresses the primary concern of maintaining balance and preventing a potentially painful or embarrassing situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - North Wales is the northernmost unofficial region of Wales. Retail, transport and educational infrastructure are centred on Wrexham, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Bangor. It is bordered to the south by the counties of Ceredigion and Powys in Mid Wales, and to the east by the counties of Shropshire in the West Midlands and Cheshire in North West England. - Gwynedd is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd. As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated. A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking. The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey. Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent. The current area is 2,548 square km (983.78 sq miles, slightly smaller than Luxembourg) with a population as measured in the 2011 Census of 121,874. - Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (c. AD 56 c. AD 120) was a senator and an historian of the Roman Empire. The surviving portions of his two major worksthe \\"Annals\\" and the \\"Histories\\"examine the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in AD 14, to the years of the First JewishRoman War, in AD 70. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the \\"Annals\\" that is four books long. - In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. - Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex in Gwynedd , Wales . The fort was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78 , and was abandoned around AD 140 . A millennium later , in the Norman period , the site was reoccupied and refortified with a motte within the old walls . It is a scheduled monument in the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority . - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use. - Gwynedd Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire, Wales. - Gnaeus Julius Agricola (13 June 40 23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \\"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain. - The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain. Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.

Movie title: Small Soldiers Movie plot: Top defense contractor GloboTech Industries acquires the Heartland Toy Company and as part of the move, Globotech CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) tells Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) to develop actual live-action toys capable of \\"playing back\\". Mars selects Larry's action figures, the Commando Elite, for the project and Irwin's educational toys, the Gorgonites, for their enemies, with the toyline expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Benson forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's overly powerful X1000 microprocessor to control the toys. Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with EMP shielding. Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer; unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are just toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro (Clint Walker), whom he mortally wounds. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the shop. At home, Alan learns the primary goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their homeland Gorgon, which they mistakenly... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Small Soldiers,\\" the Heartland Toy Company is acquired by top defense contractor GloboTech Industries. The acquisition is led by Globotech CEO Gil Mars, portrayed by Denis Leary. This acquisition sets the stage for the main plot of the movie, as Mars directs Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) to develop live-action toys that can \\"play back\\" – an idea that leads to the creation of the Commando Elite and Gorgonites toy lines. The movie follows teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) who inadvertently becomes involved in the conflict between the Commando Elite and the Gorgonites when he signs off on a shipment of the toys for his family's toy store without his father's knowledge. He later discovers that the toys are sentient due to the inclusion of an advanced X1000 microprocessor, which was originally designed for smart munitions guidance and learning capabilities. The Commando Elite, unlike the Gorgonites, do not understand that they are mere toys, leading to a series of dangerous misunderstandings and confrontations. Throughout the film, the audience watches as the conflict between the toys escalates, the Commando Elite become increasingly violent, and Alan works with the Gorgonites to protect his family and neighborhood. The movie ultimately concludes when Alan and his friends manage to defeat the Commando Elite with the help of an EMP (electromagnetic pulse), which disables the toys and their advanced microprocessors. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is important to weigh several factors. These include the unique concept of the movie, the talent attached to the project such as the cast and crew, and the potential audience appeal. \\"Small Soldiers\\" offers an interesting blend of action, adventure, comedy, and family themes, which could potentially draw a wide range of viewers. Furthermore, the film already boasts a strong cast with well-known actors, including Denis Leary, Jay Mohr, David Cross, Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Frank Langella, and Tommy Lee Jones. This, combined with the engaging storyline and unique concept, may make it a worthwhile investment.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof.

Question: \\"What does the fact that the heartwood tree can survive decay tell us?\\" Context: \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The fact that the heartwood tree can survive decay tells us several things about the tree's anatomy, growth, and adaptation mechanisms: 1. Heartwood is not vital for the tree's survival: As mentioned in the context, the term \\"heartwood\\" comes from its position in the tree, rather than its importance to the tree's life processes. Even when the heartwood is completely decayed, the tree can still thrive, suggesting that the living tissues essential for tree growth and maintenance are located elsewhere. 2. Sapwood plays a crucial role in the tree's life processes: The layer of live sapwood is responsible for transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree. It supports the functions necessary for the tree's growth and overall health. The varying thickness of sapwood among different species indicates that the concentration of living tissues may differ according to the tree's needs and adaptation strategies. 3. Tree species exhibit a range of heartwood formation patterns: Some species form heartwood early in their life, resulting in a thin layer of live sapwood. In other species, heartwood formation occurs more slowly or may not happen at all. This demonstrates the diverse growth strategies and adaptations among tree species to accommodate their specific environmental conditions and survival requirements. 4. Decay resistance varies across species: The ability of a tree to survive heartwood decay may also highlight the natural decay resistance mechanisms present in certain species. Trees with decayed heartwood but healthy sapwood may have evolved specific strategies or possess certain chemical compounds that help them combat decay and continue to thrive. In conclusion, the survival of a tree with decayed heartwood provides insights into the tree's anatomy, emphasizing the importance of sapwood for the tree's life processes, as well as the diverse growth patterns and adaptation strategies present in different tree species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She is caught by the other girls, and forced to explain that the man offered her Â£20,000 for the ring. Annabelle, the new head girl of St. Trinian's, bartered for Â£100,000 from the man when he called back, but he refused and then proceeded to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable.

As society and technology have evolved, so have the ways in which these specials have been presented. One of the most significant moments in the history of Christmas specials was when they were broadcast in color for the first time. In this article, we delve into the groundbreaking moment when Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz starred in the first ever color Christmas special, as well as the lasting impact it had on television history. The Show in Focus: A Colorful Classic The Christmas special in question was shown in color for the very first time, marking a new era in television history. This groundbreaking show starred the ever-popular Lucille Ball and her real-life husband Desi Arnaz. As pioneers of the sitcom genre, Ball and Arnaz joined forces yet again to create a one-of-a-kind holiday special that would capture the hearts of millions. Step 1: Transition to color The decision to broadcast the Christmas special in color was revolutionary at the time. Most television programming was still shown in black and white, and color televisions were not yet commonly owned. Despite this, the network believed in the power of color to add vibrancy to the performances and transform the viewing experience. The successful venture ignited a shift towards color programming in the television industry, as other networks followed suit. Step 2: Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as the leads Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as the stars of the special was a masterstroke. The couple had already captivated audiences across America with their incredibly popular show, I Love Lucy. Combining their on-screen chemistry with the dazzling visuals of a color broadcast, the Christmas special became an instant classic and a must-watch event. Step 3: Observing the Competition While the color Christmas special was a game changer, the ratings war was not without stiff competition. Airing the same year as the color special was the now-iconic A Charlie Brown Christmas. This classic animated film garnered 6.4 million viewers and quickly became a holiday institution in its own right. Despite the astounding success of A Charlie Brown Christmas, the color special starring Ball and Arnaz remained the ratings runner-up, illustrating just how monumental this event was in television history. Conclusion The introduction of color to television Christmas specials was a momentous occasion, paving the way for countless other productions to follow. The incredible performances of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in the first-ever color Christmas special remain etched in the minds of millions of viewers, serving as a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in the entertainment industry.

Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\". In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored. When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\" Philip H. Ennis sees \\"Two Hound Dogs\\", which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley & His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton's recording. While not an answer record in the traditional sense, the lyric characterized \\"Rhythm\\" and \\"Blues\\" as the titular \\"Two Hound Dogs,\\" an apparent testament to the stature of \\"Hound Dog.\\" Entity:","completion":"The text is about the song \\"Hound Dog\\" written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You are given a new situation: Dan is conducting a research to see how a substance behaves in varying pressure. First, he selects a gaseous substance in very low pressure. He calls it as case A. Then he increases the pressure. He calls it case B. Finally, he increases the pressure even further. He calls it case C. and a hint : Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium. Please answer this question : Which case would most likely see the substance turning into liquid, case B or case C? A:","completion":"Case B would most likely see the substance turning into a liquid. In Case A, the substance is in the gaseous state due to the very low pressure. As the pressure increases to Case B, the particles in the substance are forced closer together, and attractive forces between the particles cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. If the pressure is increased further to Case C, the substance might solidify, as putting a liquid under great pressure usually causes it to turn into a solid. Hence, Case B represents the most probable scenario in which the substance turns into a liquid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They started off poorly again, being held scoreless in the first half. Donovan McNabb tossed three interceptions in the first three quarters, with two of them being returned for touchdowns by Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber. Trailing 17-0, McNabb found fullback Thomas Tapeh in the end zone. A short touchdown pass to Reggie Brown brought the Eagles to within three. The Bucs added a field goal, making it 20-14.

The point after gave the Eagles the lead, and it seemed as though they had pulled out a dramatic victory. However, a last-ditch 62-yard field goal attempt by Matt Bryant somehow made it through the uprights, robbing Philadelphia of the win. Westbrook had over 100 yards in both rushing and receiving in the defeat.

According to the Post, the State Department's announcement Friday could make things more difficult for Clinton only days before the Iowa primary. The top-secret emails have to do with \\"special access programs,\\" possibly drone strikes, spying, or confidential sources, the AP reports.

The AP quotes Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon, who calls the top-secret designation \\"over-classification run amok.\\" He says at least one of the emails now marked as top secret is just information from a news article.

Olivia Dunham is a fictional character and the main protagonist from the science fiction television series Fringe, which aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States from 2008 to 2013. The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Anna Torv. Olivia is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as an FBI Special Agent, working for a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. Having grown up with an abusive stepfather, Olivia struggles with the unexpected changes in her life, following her encounter with mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop, and his son and an eventual love interest for her, Peter Bishop. The character of Olivia has been described as \\"an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel[ed] back over time.\\" She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career \\"pretty much since [she] was nine\\", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job. In the reset timeline for the series' fourth season, Torv explained that \\"The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and had all this time to get used to it and work out that this is her life,\\" rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, \\"when Lincoln comes in, she's a little more open to him [than she was with Peter] and working with someone again.\\" Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister Rachel, and Rachel's daughter Ella. Olivia was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott, and his supposed betrayal and death was something she dealt with for much of the first season. In the second season finale, Olivia and Peter Bishop finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss. Fauxlivia was involved in a serious relationship with Frank Stanton and eventually became engaged, but the two broke up when he discovered she was pregnant by Peter. Olivia was in a relationship with Peter after they mended things in episode 6B But shortly after that Peter built a bridge wiping himself from existence, causing Olivia to forget who he was. But through the cortexiphan and the power of their love, she soon remembered her life with him. They were married and have a daughter.

Makeup will be no help when your eye is still swollen, and the application might even aggravate your eye further and delay healing time. Just be patient and give your injury a few days to heal. If you have cuts or lacerations around your eye, don't risk infection by trying to cover it with makeup. You'll just have to own your black eye until it heals. A primer will keep your makeup on longer and keep it from settling into wrinkles and creases around your eye. Apply the primer wherever there is discoloration and you plan to use makeup. Dab it on gently with your ring finger, which is your weakest finger and is least likely to irritate your sink. Depending on the stage of healing, your eye could be red, black, purple, brown, green, or yellow. This shade will show through your concealer and ruin the illusion, so you need to neutralize it by applying applying the opposite color, or the color that is across the color wheel. A color correcting concealer can do this while also applying concealer, or you can improvise with blush or eyeshadow. If your bruise is green, use red, and vice versa. If your bruise is blue, use orange or salmon. If your bruise is yellow, try purple, and vice versa. Use your ring finger to gently pat the concealer around your eye, covering the color-corrected areas and also blending a little bit out beyond. Allow the concealer to dry and apply another layer if necessary. Once the concealer is dry, apply your foundation and other makeup as normal, being careful to blend the edges of your concealer with the foundation. If you didn't use primer, you can use a dusting of translucent powder to set the concealer. Eyeliner or mascara should be avoided until your eye is healed, as it draws attention to the area. Plus, tugging and pressing on your eyelid could cause more swelling. Rock a bright, attention-grabbing lipstick that will have people focusing on your lips instead of your eye. Try a new hairstyle or take some fashion risks. To out-shine your shiner, try changing your hair color or wear something with a bold print. If you've ever wanted to do something crazy with your look, now is the time!","completion":"When you have a swollen eye, it's best to be patient, let it heal, and avoid using makeup on it; instead, try using a colorful lipstick or a new hairstyle to draw attention away from your eye."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Some scientists are predicting that the ice will disappear completely by 2020 due to climate change. Scroll down for video. Professional climber Will Gadd and three other members of his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro. Mr Gadd may be one of the last to ever scale the receding ice wall as some experts believe the ice will completely disappear by 2020. After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will Gadd said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind' Mr Gadd said he felt lucky to complete the climb as the receding glaciers 'are just small remnants truly in their last grasp' After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind. ‘The glaciers are just small remnants truly in their last gasp. I felt very lucky to be there.’ The team – consisting of Will, climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana – had to cope with extreme challenges that put their bodies under incredible stress. Everyone on the team had to battle altitude sickness and sleepless nights. Will Gadd scaled the ice wall with climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana. The team had to cope with extreme challenges, including altitude sickness and sleepless nights, while scaling Africa's highest mountain. By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, Will became one of the first people in the modern era to scale the receding ice. Will said: ‘You'd just fall asleep and then wake up gasping for breath. ‘We didn't have weeks and weeks to acclimate to the altitude, it's too expensive to stay on the mountain, so we definitely pushed ourselves physically. Fortunately it all worked out OK.’ By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, each up to 200ft high, Will became one of the first people in the modern era – and possibly last – to scale the receding ice. Will Gadd said it was the 'wildest ice' he has encountered with ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand and overhanging prows. Will Gadd said the team pushed themselves physically because they didn't spend enough time acclimatising to the altitude. Will Gadd said the ice was 'literally disappearing in front of my eyes' as he scaled a frozen wall near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. Will added: ‘It was the wildest ice I've ever seen. ‘Ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand at 19,000 feet, overhanging prows that creaked while I climbed them, and so many wild possibilities blasted into crazy shapes by the high-altitude tropical sun. ‘The ice I climbed was literally disappearing in front of my eyes. None of what I climbed will survive another month. ‘Unfortunately, due to climate change, there won't be any ice on Kilimanjaro in the near future. ‘Kilimanjaro used to have ice over the entire summit plateau, but now there are only a few small glaciers remaining, and they are disappearing very fast.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Plan the path for your wires before starting any work. First look at the plan of your house and identify the rooms that require a cable hookup. Generally any rooms that will have a TV, landline phone, or computer need one. Some contractors like to run wires into every room, just in case. That way, if you decide you want a cable hookup in another room later on, you don’t have to run new wires. If you only use wifi for your internet access, then you won’t need ethernet cables in every room with a computer. The wiring panel is where all your home’s network wires connect and where service providers attach their wires to. For the best location, look for a point in your home that is out of the way and where you can easily run wires to. Contractors usually prefer to put these boxes in the basement if you have one, because it’s easy to run the wires up through the walls and to other rooms. Another popular choice is a laundry room. Wiring panels can also be unsightly, so consider locating it in a closet or a room that visitors don’t enter. Wiring panels are also sometimes called structured wiring panels or distribution boxes. Don’t get confused if a website or contractor uses one of these terms. Cables commonly feed throughout the house from either the attic or the crawlspace under the house. Since not all homes have a crawlspace, the attic is a more popular choice. Go to your wiring panel location and make sure there are hollow walls there that you can run wires up. Most sheet rock walls should be suitable. Find a point in this area that you can feed a wire straight up into the attic from. You don't need precise measurements for running these cables. If the cable ends up too long, you can just cut or roll it when it reaches the end of its route. The wiring plan gives you a general idea of the route the wires will take, and also marks cable locations for future repairs. Check the blueprints of your house for potential routes that you aren't aware of. You can use existing holes in the wall to run cables as long as they don’t have electrical wires running through them. Electrical wires will interfere with the signal. If all the holes have electrical wires, then you’ll have to drill new ones. Cables distribute throughout the house from the attic or crawlspace. Make a plan of all the rooms that need a cable hookup. Then map how each cable will feed through the attic and at which points they will enter each room. Cables usually feed down from the attic inside walls. For an easier, but less visually-appealing job, you can also cut through the room's ceiling and feed the cable down this way. If you have trouble drawing up your own diagram or using your home blueprints, search for a software program to help. There are many products that let you scan in your home blueprints and plug in which cables you want to install. The programs then produce the ideal wiring plan for your home that you can follow easily. Some programs are free and some are paid. Research different ones to see which is best for your needs. Don't try to skimp by using a cheap program if it isn't a quality one. Some paid programs offer free trials that you can use to plan one job. See if a program you're interested in offers a trial. Summary:","completion":"To plan the path for wires in your house, first find out which rooms need cable hookups, like rooms with a TV, phone, or computer. Then, choose a good spot for the wiring panel, which is like a big box where all the wires connect. People usually put it in the basement, laundry room, or a closet. Now, figure out how to run the wires from the panel to each room, usually through the attic. It helps to make a plan or use a software program. Remember that you don't want the wires too close to electrical wires, because they can cause problems. And don't worry if the cables are too long, you can cut or roll them later."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Title: Undisputed II: Last Man Standing Movie plot: Visiting the Russian Federation for a series of boxing matches, George \\"Iceman\\" Chambers is subsequently framed for possession of cocaine and sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick. Following the fight, Steven kills himself out of guilt.After the fight, Chambers (having learnt of the truth from Crot) confronts Boyka, believing that he was responsible for drugging him, and the warden, for going back on the deal.

What is the solution?","completion":"Step 1: Combine the 't' terms on the left side of the equation. We have two 't' terms on the left side: 286*t and -289*t. To combine these, we can write: (286 - 289) * t. Then we perform the subtraction: -3 * t. So, the left side of the equation is now: -3*t + 1007 + 17171. Step 2: Simplify the whole numbers on the left side of the equation. We have two whole numbers on the left side: 1007 and 17171. To combine these, we can write: 1007 + 17171. Then we perform the addition: 18178. So, the simplified equation becomes: -3*t + 18178 = -301*t. Step 3: Isolate the 't' terms on one side of the equation and the whole numbers on the other side of the equation. To do this, we will add 3*t to both sides of the equation: -3*t + 3*t + 18178 = -301*t + 3*t. This simplifies to 18178 = -298*t. Step 4: Solve for 't'. We want to isolate 't', so we should get rid of the -298 coefficient. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -298: 18178/(-298) = (-298*t)/(-298). This simplifies to t = -61.

Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Pete is a religious man who volunteers his time at Crossroads Detox, a facility supported by local churches, which Ray jokingly refers to as the \\"Jesus Shop.\\" In contrast, Ray has a more cynical and practical approach to the addiction issues faced by their clients. Pete identifies himself as a born-again \\"fundie\\" (fundamentalist), who works as a CPA at H&R Block. Through their various late-night phone calls, the two men have developed a mutual respect for one another, despite their differing perspectives. They assist each other in different ways - Ray provides his experience and advice to Pete when dealing with difficult clients, while Pete has offered his tax services to Ray at no cost. During this particular conversation, Pete mentions that he has a \\"recalcitrant\\" client - someone who is uncooperative, difficult, and resistant to change. Ray acknowledges that alcohol is a negative form of self-medication, leading to behavioral problems and the need for interventions like the services offered at the detox centers. He also reminds Pete that their job is to help these clients transform into more compliant, willing, and receptive individuals. The statements made by Pete in the passage reveal a few aspects of his character: 1. \\"Alcohol is bad medicine.\\" - This demonstrates his belief in the detrimental effects of alcohol on a person's life and recognizes the need for intervention and support to overcome addiction. 2. Not enough information - Pete may feel that he doesn't know everything there is to know about drugs and addiction, which is why he seeks Ray's advice. 3. \\"I can't do your taxes\\" - Although this statement is not found in the passage, it may suggest that Pete has a limit to the favors he can offer to Ray. Still, their relationship remains amicable due to the mutual respect and understanding between them. 4. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" - This illustrates Pete's more formal and polite language compared to Ray's more casual approach. It also reveals Pete's unique terminology when referring to the individuals who are seeking help in the detox center, opting to use a more descriptive word than derogatory terms like \\"shithead.\\" In summary, the conversation between Ray and Pete showcases their contrasting beliefs, backgrounds, and attitudes in relation to the work they do at the respective detox centers. Both men find common ground in their commitment to help individuals struggling with addiction and recognize the value in drawing on each other's expertise and experience. Through their ongoing communication and collaboration, Ray and Pete continue to navigate the challenges and difficulties of their line of work, striving to make a difference in the lives of those they serve."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Text: Genetic sexual attraction (GSA) is a term for an overwhelming sexual attraction that may develop between close blood relatives who first meet as adults. Question: can siblings fall in love with each other? OPT: i. no; ii. yes;","completion":"Yes, siblings can fall in love with each other, but it is essential to understand the complexity and various factors contributing to such relationships. Genetic Sexual Attraction (GSA) is one of the primary reasons that could lead to siblings falling in love. It generally occurs when close blood relatives, who initially did not have an opportunity to form emotional attachments during childhood or early life, meet or reunite as adults. This can result in intense feelings of attraction and arousal, which might be confusing and difficult to control. Although GSA is not the only reason why siblings can fall in love, it is the main factor contributing to such cases. There are several reasons why siblings can develop GSA or form romantic feelings for each other: 1. Absence of Westermarck effect: The Westermarck effect is a psychological theory that explains why people who grow up in close proximity with each other during their early years typically do not develop sexual attractions towards one another. Siblings separated at birth or in early childhood who meet later in life might not have experienced the Westermarck effect, which allows the siblings to bypass the natural aversion to sexual relationships with close relatives. 2. Environmental factors: Growing up in unstable or unhealthy family environments could lead to emotionally unfulfilled siblings seeking solace, comfort, and support from each other. This emotional closeness might eventually develop into a more profound romantic connection. 3. Shared interests and values: Siblings, especially those separated during their early years, might find that they share common values, interests, and experiences upon reuniting. This could create a strong bond and possibly lead to romantic attraction. 4. Curiosity: The novelty of discovering a previously unknown sibling and learning about their lives and experiences can create a sense of intrigue and curiosity, which might intensify emotional attachments leading to a romantic relationship. It's essential to emphasize that relationships between siblings are surrounded by ethical, moral, and legal concerns. Incestuous relationships are illegal in many jurisdictions and often carry severe penalties. Furthermore, relationships between siblings are prone to emotional turmoil and could be detrimental to their mental, emotional, and social wellbeing. In conclusion, while it is possible for siblings to fall in love, recognizing and addressing the potential risks and consequences of such relationships are critical. It's important for individuals experiencing these feelings to seek psychological, emotional, and moral support from friends, family, or professionals in order to maintain healthy relationships and overcome any potential complications."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. and a hint : Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Please answer this question : Which would be lighter, item A or item B?

He stopped buying at the shop and started going to the store instead, because the store had fair prices. The shop, which he had been frequenting for years, had somehow lost its touch. The once-respectable establishment had begun to charge exorbitant amounts for even the most basic items, driving customers away. The store, on the other hand, was something of a revelation. The store was located a few blocks farther from his home, but the short additional walk was not much of a burden and well worth the savings. It was a well-organized and clean business, with wide aisles that were continuously stocked with an array of fresh, high-quality products. Upon entering, he was always greeted with a warm, genuine smile from the friendly staff. These employees were attentive and eager to help, always willing to answer any questions he might have about their products or guide him to a specific item he was looking for. The store also invested in getting to know their customers. They were truly interested in their shoppers' needs and preferences, often stocking new and unique items based on feedback and requests. There was a certain sense of community within the store, as the regular customers began to recognize one another and engage in friendly conversation. This social atmosphere was something he had been missing at the shop, and it made the new store feel like a home away from home. At the store, he marveled at the selection available. In every category, there were multiple brands and varieties, all at competitive prices. The store was also known for having frequent sales and promotions, offering even better deals to its customers. With an emphasis on locally-sourced and organic products, the store was not only meeting his budgetary needs, but also his desire to support sustainable and responsible practices. One aspect of the store he particularly appreciated was the dedication to reducing waste. All products were either minimally packaged or sold in bulk, allowing customers to choose the amount they needed and avoid unnecessary plastic or cardboard packaging. In addition, the store's reusable bag policy encouraged customers to reduce their reliance on single-use plastic bags. There was also a sense of fun and exploration at the store. Regular events, such as food tastings, cooking demonstrations, and seminars on a variety of topics aligned with his interests. It was not just a place to shop, but a hub for learning and personal growth, catering to every aspect of the modern consumer's lifestyle. Over time, he found himself looking forward to each visit to the store. The excitement of discovering new products, the camaraderie with fellow shoppers, and the uncompromising commitment to fair prices made it his top choice for all his shopping needs. As he looked back, he couldn't help but feel both a sense of sadness for the decline of the shop and a newfound gratitude for the opportunity to have found an alternative. While the memories of his years spent shopping at the old shop would forever hold a place in his heart, he knew that he would continue to build new memories and experiences at the store—the place where he found fair prices, quality products, and a sense of belonging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wilhelm Justus Goebel was born January 4, 1856, in Albany Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the son of Wilhelm and Augusta (Groenkle) Goebel, immigrants from Hanover, Germany. The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their German heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the English spelling of his name. In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated his seat in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of lieutenant governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was not to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election close - decided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes. With only the two years remaining in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed and sent to the Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent. In 1890, Goebel was a delegate to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as a delegate, Goebel showed little interest in participating in the process of creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly. Were his ideas well received?","completion":"While some of Wilhelm Goebel's ideas and actions were well received, others faced opposition. His focus on railroad regulation and championing labor causes appealed to many citizens in his district, which helped him win elections. His actions against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, such as serving on the committee that uncovered violations by the railroad lobby and defending the Railroad Commission, made him a hero in his district and secured him re-elections to the Kentucky Senate. However, his political career was also marked by contentious moments, such as the close victory in the 1887 election due to the rise of the Union Labor party, and his lack of active participation in the process of creating a new Kentucky Constitution during the 1890 convention. Overall, Wilhelm Goebel's ideas and actions were well received by certain segments of the population, particularly those who shared his concerns about railroad regulation and labor rights, but there were instances where his actions faced opposition and close competition from other political groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse.

Answer a question about this article: During the First World War, to avoid ground fights between brothers, many Alsatians served as sailors in the Kaiserliche Marine and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918, which left Alsace-Lorraine without a nominal head of state. The sailors returned home and tried to found a republic. While Jacques Peirotes, at this time deputy at the Landrat Elsass-Lothringen and just elected mayor of Strasbourg, proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic, a self-proclaimed government of Alsace-Lorraine declared independence as the \\"Republic of Alsace-Lorraine\\". French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power. At the arrival of the French soldiers, many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order (which can be seen and is described in detail in the reference video below). Although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had insisted that the région was self-ruling by legal status, as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state, France tolerated no plebiscite, as granted by the League of Nations to some eastern German territories at this time, because Alsatians were considered by the French public as fellow Frenchmen liberated from German rule. Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles.

[B]. positive.","completion":"To determine if the review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie, let's analyze the given statement: \\"Is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it.\\" Step 1: Identify sentiment keywords/phrases - \\"not as terrible\\": This phrase implies something less negative. - \\"synergistic impulse\\": This phrase might suggest some sort of collaboration or combined effort that led to the creation of the movie. However, the context it's used in is important. Step 2: Analyze the overall sentiment - The statement compares the movie to the \\"synergistic impulse\\" behind it. The movie is \\"not as terrible\\" as that impulse, meaning it is somewhat better, but not necessarily good or positively praised. It implies a less-negative outlook on the movie, while still maintaining a somewhat negative stance. Considering the analysis, the review expresses a negative opinion of the movie, but it's not as negative as the process that created the film. So, the correct choice is: [A]. negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The given premise, \\"That's what brought the name into your mind so pat,\\" is ambiguous in meaning. The phrase \\"so pat\\" may imply a strong association, a perfect timing, or a suitable fit. However, it does not provide enough information about the situation or what specifically led to the name being brought into your mind. The hypothesis, \\"That is why you completely forgot the name,\\" suggests that there was a reason or factor contributing to the forgetting of the name. It is possible that the premise and hypothesis are related – perhaps the perfect timing or the strong association caused a distraction resulting in the name being forgotten. However, without additional context, it is impossible to say for certain if the premise entails the hypothesis. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell if the given premise entails the hypothesis without more information about the situation, the name, and the specific event or association that led to the name being brought into your mind and subsequently forgotten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: and the situation: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

Question: \\"Why were people dying in India in the 18th century?\\" Context: \\"During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"People were dying in India in the 18th century due to several reasons, which can be analyzed step by step: 1. Military conflicts: As the context states, during the middle decades of the 18th century, there were outbreaks of military conflicts such as the Carnatic Wars. The English East India Company and the French Compagnie française des Indes orientales, along with local rulers, were vying for power in the wake of the decline of the Mughal Empire. Military conflicts often result in casualties, both among combatants and civilians caught in the crossfire. 2. The decline of the Mughal Empire: The decline of the Mughal Empire led to a power vacuum and political instability in the region. Local rulers and foreign companies struggled to seize control, which contributed to the overall unrest, and may have led to a decline in public health and safety, causing more deaths. 3. Colonial rule and exploitation: The British East India Company gained control of Bengal after winning the Battle of Plassey in 1757. As the Company increased its territories, it exploited resources and people for its own benefit. Land and taxation policies often led to famines that caused numerous deaths. The most notorious example was the Bengal Famine of 1770, during which an estimated 10 million people died. 4. Epidemics and diseases: The 18th century was a time of limited medical knowledge and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. People in India, like in many parts of the world, faced a variety of diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and malaria, causing widespread deaths. The disarray during military conflicts and the decline of the Mughal Empire would have affected sanitation, clean water availability, and overall public health, increasing the spread of such diseases. 5. Forced labor and military service: The British Indian Army consisted largely of Indian sepoys, who were often recruited or conscripted by force. This led to many young men leaving their homes and families, with some never returning due to injuries or fatalities sustained in battles or other military conflicts. In conclusion, people were dying in India in the 18th century primarily due to military conflicts, political instability, colonial exploitation, epidemics and diseases, and forced labor and military service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: World Without End Movie plot: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The \\"mutates\\" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance).

Animal: Most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals. Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

In fact, the given premise and hypothesis are contradictory to each other. Let's examine both statements in more detail to understand why this is the case. Premise: A man with a blue, yellow, and green swimming cap is wearing goggles and swimming. This premise describes a situation in which there is a man who is actively swimming. He is wearing a swimming cap with blue, yellow, and green colors, along with a pair of goggles. The man's actions and attire both indicate that he is engaged in an aquatic activity, which is swimming, as specified. Hypothesis: Nobody is swimming. On the other hand, the hypothesis completely negates the scenario presented in the premise. The hypothesis asserts that there is no individual engaged in swimming at the scene being discussed. This statement is incongruous with the premise, which has already established that we have at least one person – the man with the swimming cap – who is undeniably swimming. Since the premise and hypothesis bear conflicting information about whether or not someone is swimming, we can conclude that accepting the premise as true will invalidate the hypothesis. This renders it impossible to accept the hypothesis as true while simultaneously acknowledging the truth of the premise. Thus, if the premise is true, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is also true.

Article: Beer is the world's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Brightly colored hummers can beat their wings up to 50 times per second as they hover over flowers, extracting nectar. And while common belief among biologists has long held that their feeding is facilitated by ‘wicking’ – capillary action that allows liquid to flow through small spaces without benefit of gravity – a UConn study published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, debunks that theory. The research, conducted by research scientist Alejandro Rico-Guevara and Professor Margaret Rubega from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Tai-Hsi Fan, associate professor of mechanical engineering, looked at 18 hummingbird species from seven of the nine main hummingbird groups throughout the Americas. They concluded that the ‘wicking theory’ is wrong, and that the bird’s tongue actually acts as a tiny pump. Rico-Guevara explains that a hummingbird’s tongue, which can be stuck out about the same length as its beak, is tipped with two long skinny tubes, or grooves. Rather than wicking, he says, the nectar is drawn into the tongue by the elastic expansion of the grooves after they are squeezed flat by the beak. The tongue structure is collapsed during the time it crosses the space between the bill tip and the nectar pool, but once the tip contacts the nectar surface, the supply of fluid allows the collapsed groove to gradually recover to a relaxed cylindrical shape as the nectar fills it. When the hummingbird squeezes nectar off its tongue during protrusion, it is collapsing the grooves and loading elastic energy into the groove walls. That energy subsequently facilitates the pumping of more nectar. Actually, everything is relative. When Rico-Guevara says the collapsed groove ‘gradually recovers’ as it fills with nectar, he is talking about an event that is infinitesimally brief, since the entire action takes place in less than a tenth of a second. In fact, it is the speed that first made Rubega and Rico-Guevara skeptical about the role that wicking might play in the feeding process. They were convinced that the slow fill speed of capillary action would limit the hummingbird’s rate of absorbing nectar and thus its energy intake rate. This is where Fan’s expertise in fluid mechanics and biological transport came in handy. “We could see the actual drinking mechanism through high speed video,” says Rico-Guevara, “but we couldn’t develop the fluid dynamics model needed to test our biophysical hypothesis.” In collaboration with Fan, an expert in fluid mechanics and biological transport phenomena, the biologists were able to test different hypotheses and validate the physics behind their explanation. Rubega says most previous studies involving hummingbird feeding were conducted under artificial conditions in laboratories where the birds had access to feeders that had far more liquid available than would actually be found in flowers in the wild. The research she and Rico-Guevara conducted involved filming free-living hummingbirds that had never been handled as they fed at modified transparent feeders that simulated the shape, nectar volumes, and concentrations of actual hummingbird-pollinated flowers. The data they collected from this wild population is the largest data set on hummingbird feeding mechanics to date. Rubega says it’s important to understand evolution and the relationship between flowers and birds. She notes that flowers don’t give nectar away without expecting something in return. “Nectar is kind of a bribe,” she says. “It’s payment for the hummingbird to come frequently enough so that they will go off and act as pollinators to other flowers of the same species. ” Rico-Guevera adds that during their evolution, hummingbirds became what they are because of their skill at drinking nectar. The researchers say their study found an excellent match between what mathematical models predicted and what they were observing through high-speed video. “Our research shows how they really drink and provides the first mathematical tools to accurately model their energy intake,” says Rico-Guevara, “which will in turn inform our understanding of their foraging decisions and ecology.” ||||| Recent research shows that the birds take in plant fluid, real or artificial, at ultra-high speeds using a pumping method – not a wicking one, as previously believed. Did the ALS 'Ice Bucket Challenge' really help research? Scientists say yes. Hummingbirds are named for the sound of their rapidly beating wings, but now their tongues have captured scientists' attention. These tiny birds can suck 10 drops of nectar out of a flower every 15 milliseconds, researchers at the University of Connecticut recently discovered. For nearly two centuries, scientists have thought the birds used a much slower “wicking” technique, LiveScience reported. It turns out that hummingbird tongues do not wick – they pump. By capturing video footage of 18 species of hummingbirds drinking from artificial “flowers,” the research team – led by research scientist Alejandro Rico-Guevara, ecology and evolutionary biology professor Margaret Rubega, and mechanical engineering associate professor Tai-Hsi Fan – found that the birds’ tongues have tube-like grooves that rest in a collapsed state, but open and fill with nectar upon contact with flowers. “The tongue works as an elastic micropump; fluid at the tip is driven into the tongue's grooves by forces resulting from re-expansion of a collapsed section,” the report says. The study’s methodology surpasses that of previous hummingbird research, Professor Rubega said in a university news release, because it comes closer than ever to approximating real-life conditions. In previous studies, captive birds sipped nectar from feeders in laboratories containing far more liquid than a real flower. This time, scientists filmed wild hummingbirds feeding from transparent feeders that mimic the shape, nectar amounts, and calorie concentrations of hummingbirds' favorite flowers. The study has yielded the largest data set of any hummingbird study to date – the result of five years’ work. Dr. Rico-Guevara told LiveScience that building the transparent “flowers” was a challenging but essential part of the research, since “when the [hummingbird's] bill goes inside a flower, you don't see what is happening inside at all.” The design used transparent tubes filled with artificial nectar, with cameras set up nearby. The next challenge was observing different species of hummingbirds. The only hummingbird found east of the Mississippi is the Ruby-throated Hummingbird, so the researchers had to go further afield to gather a broad sample. By setting up shop in a number of locations across the Americas – including Connecticut, Texas, California, Ecuador, Brazil, and Colombia – they gathered footage of 32 different birds from 18 different species. \\"I tried to get as many different kinds of hummingbirds as possible,\\" Rico-Guevara told LiveScience. \\"Not just to get different species, but [also] the crazy ones, the extreme ones, just to be able to generalize what happens.\\" The discovery of the micro-pump method of feeding may lead scientists to revisit previous hummingbird research, Rico-Guevara said. Earlier studies indicate that some flowers produce diluted nectar, which would be helpful for hummingbirds feeding using capillary “wicking” as previously assumed, but which is unnecessary for micro-pump feeding. The new study was published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. “Our research shows how they really drink and provides the first mathematical tools to accurately model their energy intake,” Rico-Guevara said in the news release, “which will in turn inform our understanding of their foraging decisions and ecology.” ||||| Published on Aug 19, 2015 UConn researchers examined 18 hummingbird species throughout the Americas for a recent study on hummingbird tongues. A common belief among biologists has long held that their feeding is facilitated by ‘wicking’ – capillary action that allows liquid to flow through small spaces without benefit of gravity. However, UConn researchers Alejandro Rico-Guevara, Maragret Rubega and Tai-Hsi Fan concluded that the ‘wicking theory’ is wrong, and that the bird’s tongue actually acts as a tiny pump. For more information on the study, check out this link: http://today.uconn.edu/2015/08/hummin... ||||| The slender hummingbird tongue has been misunderstood for more than 180 years, a new study finds. Since 1833, scientists thought that hummingbird tongues used capillary action — a phenomenon in which liquid flows through narrow areas, even working against gravity — to slurp up floral nectar. Researchers got this intriguing (but wrong) idea because the birds have long groves on their tongues that look like open cylinders, said Alejandro Rico-Guevara, lead researcher of the new study and a research associate of functional morphology at the University of Connecticut. But capillary action is slow, at least by hummingbird standards. Using high-speed videos, researchers in the new study determined that hummingbird tongues act as elastic micropumps, allowing the birds to feed at rapid speeds, Rico-Guevara said. [See Photos of Hummingbirds Sticking Out Their Tongues] Most people are familiar with simple pumps — the drinking straw, for instance. When sipping a beverage through a straw, people contort their cheeks to create a vacuum in the straw and suction up the liquid, Rico-Guevara said. The hummingbird's tongue works in a slightly similar way, but without a vacuum. After zipping toward a flower, the hummingbird flattens its outstretched tongue, and \\"the compressed tongue remains flattened until it contacts the nectar,\\" the researchers wrote in the study. \\"After contact with the nectar surface, the tongue reshapes filling entirely with nectar.\\" A juvenile male black-throated mango hummingbird in Finca El Colibrí Gorriazul, Fusagasugá, Colombia. Without the use of any muscles or nerves, a hummingbird's tongue can rapidly expand to pull in nectar from a flower. Credit: Kristiina Hurme To pull in the nectar, the top of the tongue (the part closer to the mouth) bends, so it's no longer flat, and this bending stores elastic energy, Rico-Guevara said. That energy helps draw the nectar out of the flower and into the bird's mouth, he said. \\"We show that the tongue works as an elastic micropump,\\" the researchers said. \\"Fluid at the tip is driven into the tongue's grooves by forces resulting from re-expansion of a collapsed section\\" of the tongue closer to the mouth. This fast technique allows the bird to drain between five and 10 drops of nectar from a flower within 15 milliseconds (about 100th of a second), Rico-Guevara said. Transparent flowers Setting up the experiment took five years, Rico-Guevara said, and involved constructing \\"flowers\\" researchers could look into. \\"When the [hummingbird's] bill goes inside a flower, you don't see what is happening inside at all,\\" Rico-Guevara told Live Science. \\"My first challenge was to make see-through flowers.\\" He used tiny glass tubes, filled them with artificial nectar and set up the high-speed video cameras near the tubes. This setup was repeated in a number of places, including Connecticut, Texas, California, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil. \\"I tried to get as many different kinds of hummingbirds as possible,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"Not just to get different species, but [also] the crazy ones, the extreme ones, just to be able to generalize what happens\\" when they feed. In all, he filmed 96 foraging bouts, which included 32 birds from 18 species licking up artificial nectar from the transparent tubes.

Hummingbirds can extend their long, skinny tongues twice as far as the bill, which helps them reach nectar deep inside flowers. Credit: Kristiina Hurme The researchers spent hours examining the footage. In 2011, they published a study explaining that the hummingbird tongue is not a capillary tube, but instead works by trapping fluid. However, they still didn't know exactly how it worked. In the new study, the researchers explained that the tongue is a tiny pump that can pull in nectar. Rico-Guevara developed two computer models with Tai-Hsi Fan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and expert on fluid dynamics at the University of Connecticut, to determine how the hummingbird's tongue works. One model represented capillary action, and the other emulated the elastic micropump. [Images: Beautiful Hummingbirds of the World] \\"We translated all of the pieces into mathematics to create predictions that we could test,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"The match was really great with the elastic micropump one, so we were very happy.\\" The models showed that if hummingbirds used capillarity in the wild, they would have to slow way down, he said. The elastic micropump method allows hummingbirds to lick a flower up to 20 times per second, or at 20 hertz. \\"But if they were using capillarity, they would have to slow it down to 5 hertz,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"Which is still pretty fast, but when you're out there and you have so much pressure [to survive], every millisecond counts.\\" The finding may prompt scientists to give existing hummingbird research a second look. For instance, earlier studies suggested that some flowers developed dilute nectar, which is easier for hummingbirds to consume via capillary action than is concentrated nectar. But if hummingbirds don't use capillary action, then it's unclear why certain flowers have dilute nectar, Rico-Guevara said. (Dilution levels don't matter much for the elastic micropump method, he said.) \\"We need to develop the models again and see why those flowers have those concentrations in general,\\" Rico-Guevara said.

This article: Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

Under the judge's order, the officers will be held for 30 days, Jose Luis Manjarrez, a spokesman for the Mexican Attorney-General's Office, said Monday. They will be transferred to Mexico City from the state of Morelos, where they are being held, he said. The 12 officers are under investigation in relation to five charges, including attempted murder, according to one of their lawyers, Marco Aurelio Gonzalez. Following the shooting incident Friday, two U.S. Embassy employees, described by a senior U.S. government official as U.S. citizens, were taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening wounds. A member of the Mexican Navy who was with them in the vehicle suffered light bruises, according to a statement from the Mexican Navy. The statement provided the following account of events: Just Watched Diplomatic vehicle shot up in Mexico replay More Videos ... Diplomatic vehicle shot up in Mexico 01:14 PLAY VIDEO The incident unfolded at 8 a.m. Friday, as the two embassy employees and the Mexican were traveling to a military facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) earlier, they had left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias, a thinly populated area off the main road. When a vehicle containing Federal Police approached and its occupants brandished their weapons, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade them and return to the main highway. At that point, the police sprayed bullets into the black SUV with diplomatic plates. Moments later, three other vehicles carrying Federal Police joined the attack, also shooting at the U.S. Embassy vehicle. By now, the Mexican Navy official who was in the embassy vehicle had contacted personnel at a nearby military installation, who arrived after the firing had ended and cordoned off the site, the Navy statement said. Both embassy employees were taken, under Federal Police guard, to a hospital. Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat. In addition to the attempted murder charge, the detained police officers are facing charges of abuse of authority, damage to property, bodily harm and abuse of public duty, according to Gonzalez. The lawyer said that the officers were investigating a kidnapping when they came across the embassy vehicle, which ignored their requests to stop. The Mexican Public Security Secretariat has acknowledged in a statement that the officers fired on the armored vehicle with diplomatic plates while they were looking for a group of suspected criminals. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico is cooperating with the investigation into the shooting incident, Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Monday. \\"I'm not going to get ahead of the investigation. I think we're going to wait and see what that concludes,\\" she said when asked whether the incident was an attack or an ambush. The violent incident is the third in recent years involving U.S. officials in Mexico. In 2010, a U.S. consular employee, her husband and another man died in a gun attack in Ciudad Juarez. And in 2011, a U.S. immigration and customs agent was killed and another was wounded in an attack by an armed group on a highway in the state of San Luis Potosi. Violence related to drug gangs has increased in recent years in Morelos, the state where the shooting incident took place Friday. ||||| 12 Mexico police held over US embassy car shooting MEXICO CITY — A Mexican judge ordered 12 federal police officers held for 40 days on Monday as prosecutors mull charges against them for shooting at a US embassy car and wounding two US government employees. The officers are being treated as suspects over Friday's incident, when a sport-utility vehicle with diplomatic plates was chased by four cars south of Mexico City and hit by a hail of bullets. \\"We will continue to deepen the investigation,\\" Attorney General Marisela Morales Ibanez told reporters. \\"Right now we have an abuse of power.\\" \\"We are cooperating with all national and international authorities that we must collaborate with to clarify the events,\\" Morales added. She did not indicate what other charges the officers could face apart from abuse of power over the shooting, which the US embassy has described as an ambush.

When the US vehicle veered back onto a highway, three more cars joined the chase and shot at the SUV, which was riddled with bullets near Tres Marias, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital. The US embassy has not identified the two wounded employees or the nature of their work in Mexico, which is in the throes of a drug war that has left some 50,000 people dead since 2006. Mexico's ombudsman, Raul Plascencia, said the shooting was an \\"extremely serious mistake by the officers, which could be an orchestrated action.\\" \\"There is no justification for such an excessive use of force,\\" the head of the National Human Rights Commission told a news conference.

The receptionist was very nice however, when I walked into the office it was an uninviting atmosphere. I waited about an hour to be seen. The entire clinical staff was unfriendly and unwelcoming. The MA took my blood pressure and did not bother to relay the reading to me. Neither she nor the Dr. asked if I had any concerns that I wanted to discuss. The reason for my visit was for my annual physical, discuss the removal of a paragard IUD and the placement of a Mirena IUD. (I am menopausal and am on estrogen therapy so I need opposing progesterone). I have conducted much research of published studies supporting the use of the Mirena IUD to provide opposed progesterone while using estrogen for menopausal symptoms. I told him I did not want to use an oral progesterone due to the side effects (specifically weight gain) as studies have shown that direct vaginal application (Mirena IUD) or transdermal patches do not produce these side effects.THERE ARE RECENT PUBLISHED MEDICAL STUDIES PROVING THIS!! His comment was that he would not know why anyone would want to use the Mirena IUD for this purpose and that the claims of side effects of oral progesterone (weight gain) were false.

It adheres to the basic rules of English grammar, which include syntax, word formation, and semantics. Let's break down the elements of this sentence to better understand why it is linguistically acceptable: 1. Syntax: Syntax deals with the arrangement of words and phrases, as well as the formation of sentences. In the given sentence, the subject is \\"Calvin,\\" the verb is \\"admired,\\" and the object is \\"himself.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"in the mirror\\" acts as an adjunct providing supplementary information about the location of the action. The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern common in English sentences. Thus, the sentence has a correct syntactic structure. 2. Word formation: Word formation pertains to the rules and processes by which new words are created in a language. In the given sentence, all the words are formed according to the morphological rules of English. There are no spelling errors or unconventional word forms. \\"Calvin\\" is a noun (a proper noun in this case, as it is a person's name), \\"admired\\" is a verb (the past tense of the verb \\"admire\\"), \\"himself\\" is a reflexive pronoun used to refer back to the subject, and \\"in\\" and \\"the mirror\\" constitute a prepositional phrase, with \\"in\\" being a preposition and \\"the mirror\\" being a noun phrase. This sentence uses appropriate word formation processes. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. In the given sentence, the meaning is clear: Calvin is looking at (and presumably appreciating) his own reflection in the mirror. All the words and phrases contribute effectively to convey this meaning. The pronoun \\"himself\\" ensures the reader understands that Calvin is admiring his own reflection rather than someone else's, while \\"in the mirror\\" eliminates any ambiguity about the context in which this action is taking place. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Calvin admired himself in the mirror\\" is linguistically acceptable as it adheres to the fundamental rules of English grammar, including syntax, word formation, and semantics. It is a coherent and well-formed sentence that effectively communicates the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls. Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Who is Havelock Ellis and what did he discover about children and sexuality?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step in the process of a red giant's evolution, after the outer layers are shed and only the inner core remains, is the formation of a white dwarf along with a possible planetary nebula. When the red giant can no longer sustain nuclear fusion at its core due to the depletion of its fuel, the core temperature drops, and it starts to contract under its own gravity. Concurrently, the outer envelope of the star expands and the star becomes a red giant. Eventually, the hydrogen shell burning surrounding the inert core does not produce enough thermal pressure to counterbalance the gravitational forces, and the star can no longer sustain nuclear fusion in its core. As a result, the outer layers begin to drift away from the core, leading to the ejection of the star's envelope, which then expands and illuminates, forming a planetary nebula. This phenomenon occurs because the ejected gas and dust, consisting mainly of hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of heavier elements, are ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the hot core. The inner core, which is made of carbon and oxygen, is left behind and is called a white dwarf. These remnants do not undergo further fusion reactions due to their degenerate state and lack of significant mass, but they still emit light and heat as they cool down. These white dwarfs usually have a mass that is close to that of our Sun, but their size is only slightly larger than that of Earth, making them extremely dense objects. The white dwarf will continue to radiate its leftover heat into space for billions of years, gradually cooling down and progressively dimming until it forms a cold, dark 'black dwarf,' which is an extremely dense, non-luminous object no longer visible to the naked eye. However, it is important to note that not all stars end their lives in the same way. For more massive stars (greater than eight solar masses), the process might differ, involving core-collapse supernovae and ultimately forming neutron stars or black holes instead of white dwarfs. The specific evolutionary pathway of a star depends on various factors such as its initial mass, chemical composition, and interaction with its stellar environment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\". In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer. Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.","completion":"This text is about Barack Hussein Obama II, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

They said they \\"appreciated the patience\\" shown by customers as high demand led to waiting times of more than an hour on Monday morning. Organisers said there was no need to rush as the public had four weeks to place requests for tickets. After that period, tickets will be allocated by a \\"fair and simple draw\\". A Glasgow 2014 spokeswoman said: \\"We have already processed many thousands of applications through our website and continue to do so as quickly as possible.\\" She added: \\"But this is not a sprint - everyone has until 16 September to make their choices and get their applications in and we encourage everyone to get involved in Scotland's biggest-ever festival of world-class sport.\\" Commonwealth Games: Tickets Q&A The 11-day games, which begin on 23 July 2014, will see 4,500 athletes compete in 17 sports across 14 venues. An official ticket guide was released last month and the first phase ticketing process runs until 16 September. Olympic silver medallist swimmer Michael Jamieson marked the start of sales by diving into the refurbished pool at the Tollcross International Swimming Centre. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014, said: \\"There is no advantage to putting your application in on the first day, a day in the middle or at the end. \\"We will not process any applications until that phase closes. \\"Our advice to everybody is go online or grab a copy of our ticketing brochure, sit down with family and friends and work out what works for you.\\" Applications can be made online with debit or credit cards or by post, using the form in the ticket guide. The ticket-buying process will be operated by Ticketmaster, who sold 10.9 million Olympics tickets but came in for criticism over the system of bidding for batches of tickets. The Commonwealth Games organisers have been keen to stress that lessons have been learned from the London Olympics ticketing problems. Commonwealth Games: Golden ticket They said they had concentrated on keeping the ticketing process simple, making sure that payment was easy and allowing fans to be confident that there are lots of tickets available. At last year's Olympics, blocks of empty seats reserved for \\"the Olympic family\\" or sponsors were a major talking point at early events, so Mr Speer said the Glasgow games had made a commitment that at least 70% of all seats, for all sessions at all venues, would be available to the public. Mr Speer said a second phase of ticket sales would run from later in October, with tickets on general sale. But he said the aim of the first round was to give as many people as possible an equal chance of getting tickets. He said people would either get exactly what they wanted when applying for a session or nothing at all. He said there was no chance of people being given tickets for diving if they applied for a swimming session and they would not get three tickets if they applied for four. Ticket prices start from £15 for adults, with half-price concessions on the cheapest tickets available for children and the over-60s. Organisers said about 60% of the tickets were priced at £25 or less and all included use of public transport in the local area on the day of the event. However, the more popular sessions could cost much more than that. Spectators hoping to witness prized events such as the 100m sprint final at Hampden on Monday 28 July, which could feature Jamaica's Usain Bolt, will pay between £30 and £90. The only seats priced higher are the £120 ringside views for certain boxing sessions. Tickets for the opening ceremony - which takes place on Wednesday 23 July - will cost between £40 and £250. The closing ceremony on Sunday 3 August will be slightly cheaper, with a top price of £200. Despite claims from the organisers that the ticketing strategy was \\"family-friendly\\", concerns have been raised over the limit on the number of tickets for which people can apply at certain sessions. The majority of the more popular events, such as swimming, athletics and track cycling, will have a four-ticket per application limit, which could exclude larger families. Mr Speer said for about 60% of the sessions the ticket limit was eight or 10 per application. However, it was lowered to four for sessions \\"where we feel confident there will be enormous demand\\". Mr Speer said: \\"We want to make sure we allow the greatest number of people to have the chance to have those tickets and obviously if people are coming in and potentially ordering 10 tickets that, by definition, reduces the number of families and households that will get a chance to go. So it is really about fairness.\\"","completion":"High demand for Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games tickets led to waiting times of more than an hour, but organizers assured the public that they have four weeks to place requests, after which tickets will be allocated by a fair and simple draw."},{"prompt":"Q:Today it is found that school students hardly pay much attention to sports.It is because they have no interest in sports?

She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability.

The Get Up Kids are an American rock band from Kansas City, Missouri. Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-1990s emo scene, otherwise known as the \\"second wave\\" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation. It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled \\"The Get Up Kids / Coalesce\\". For the split, each band covered one of the other's songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of \\"Second Place\\", and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of \\"Harvest of Maturity\\". A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase. While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids' announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label's insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band's income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record \\"Don't Hate Me\\" from Four Minute Mile for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was \\"the best that [they could] write\\". Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based Vagrant Records. He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead, offering them 50,000 to record a second album, as well as their own imprint, Heroes & Villains Records.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was Four Minute Mile their album name?","completion":"Yes, \\"Four Minute Mile\\" was their album name.

Her father, whom she loved dearly, died of tuberculosis a few years ago. Elina finds consolation in wandering out on the dangerous marshlands to have imaginary conversations with her dead father. Elina also contracted tuberculosis, but recovered. Because she was ill for so long, Elina is obliged to repeat a whole year at school.

A massive car bomb tore through the heart of a bustling marketplace in Peshawar, Pakistan, Wednesday, killing at least 100 people -- including many women and children -- and injuring at least 200 others, officials said. A vehicle packed with 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives detonated at the Meena Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops popular with women. The impact destroyed buildings, burying people underneath the rubble, and sparked massive fires in the shops, mosques, and homes. In a year of seemingly endless militant attacks in Pakistan, this was the deadliest. Those who survived described a narrow escape:. \\"I ducked quickly and when I looked up it was complete darkness,\\" said Imdad. \\"I couldn't see anyone. The cars and the van were lying upside down.\\" Are you there? Send your photos and videos to iReport. Fareed Ullah, a student at a nearby mosque, was injured when he fell from the second floor as he tried to escape a fire ignited by the blast at the Meena Bazaar. \\"We only saw a red blaze and nothing else,\\" he said from his hospital bed. \\"My friends and I fell from the second floor. We didn't know where we were.\\" The remote-controlled detonation killed at least 100 people and injured as many as 200 others, hospital and government officials said. The deaths include 68 males and 32 females, including 10 children, the head of the main hospital in Peshawar said. The car bomb left a 10-foot-wide crater, and the flames spread quickly through stores selling highly flammable fabric. Residents and shopkeepers expressed outrage that militants were able to carry out the attack in broad daylight, the latest in a string of militant attacks targeting civilians in Peshawar. \\"What kind of security alert is this? It was an explosives-packed car,\\" a middle-aged shopkeeper at Meena Bazaar said. \\"Look at the mosque, it ceases to exist anymore. For God's sake, do something!\\" \\"Increasing chaos\\" in Pakistan. The Peshawar car bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on Pakistan since the October 2007 attack on a homecoming rally for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. More than 135 people were killed in the suicide bombing in Karachi. Bhutto escaped harm, but she was assassinated two months later. Wednesday's bombing happened hours after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to shore up U.S. support in nuclear-armed Pakistan, as it battles a rising Taliban insurgency. Clinton condemned the strike, and dared the militants who were responsible to put down their arms and appeal to the Pakistani people through the political process. \\"If the people behind the attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process, let them come forth to the people and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school, that they want women to be kept back, that they believe they have all the answers,\\" Clinton said in a joint news conference with her Pakistani counterpart in Islamabad. \\"They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is,\\" she said of those responsible for the car bombing in Peshawar. Read more about Clinton's comments on blast. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also condemned the deadly attack, offering his condolences to the victims and their families and directly addressing the attackers. \\"We will not buckle, we will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan,\\" Qureshi said. \\"You are on the run and we know that. We defeated you in Swat and Malakand. You think by attacking innocent people and lives you will shake our determination? No, sir, you will not.\\" The attack is the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province which has been the site of five militant strikes this month alone. A suicide car bombing on October 9 in Khyber Bazaar killed at least 49 people and injured 135 others. And, just last Friday, a car bomb exploded outside a banquet hall in Peshawar, wounding at least 15 people. The massive casualties in Wednesday's bombing prompted a state of emergency at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where most of the injured were treated. The hospital appealed to other medical centers -- and to the public -- to donate blood, hospital officials said. North West Frontier Province is bearing the brunt of the massive civilian displacement from Pakistan's military offensive in the neighboring tribal region along the Afghan border. More than 180,000 civilians have fled to North West Frontier Province from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to the United Nations. Pakistan's military offensive is currently focused on South Waziristan, where the government believes the Pakistani Taliban has masterminded numerous attacks, including the October 10 siege of Pakistan's army headquarters in Rawalpindi, outside Islamabad. That siege and other attacks outside the tribal region have raised concerns about the ability of government forces to maintain control. President Obama signed legislation this month providing an additional 7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years. The White House is working on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Peshawar is a strategic city for both Taliban militants and the U.S. and NATO military, who are waging a battle against Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. Located about 100 miles (167 kilometers) northwest of the capital, Islamabad, Peshawar sits on the main supply route into Afghanistan and is the gateway to Pakistan's ungoverned tribal regions.

This article will explore the events surrounding the altercation, the team's response, and the subsequent resolution, with the aim of highlighting the importance of managing internal conflicts and fostering positive interpersonal relationships within a sports team. The incident began during a practice session when Bennett was seen slamming the first-round pick into the ground after an apparent face mask.

As tensions escalated, Bennett had to be restrained by his teammates, showcasing the importance of solidarity and collective responsibility in maintaining discipline and order. The consequences of the altercation were swift, with Head coach Marc Trestman cutting short the practice session by ten minutes. This decision highlights the increasing need for coaches to monitor and maintain a healthy team atmosphere, prioritizing player welfare and team cohesion above all else. The Bears organization went a step further by suspending and fining Bennett for his actions, citing 'conduct detrimental to the team.' This move clearly showcases the team's commitment to enforcing a strict code of conduct and ensuring that no player is above the rules, regardless of their status or seniority. Despite the dramatic events, it is important to highlight the subsequent resolution between Bennett and the first-round pick.

Splash of the day: Gary Lineker is doused in water for the charity challenge. A spokesman for Tesco in Portsmouth said: 'There has been a massive drive in sales of ice for the store. 'Normally in summer we sell two or three cases a day and in each case there are about six bags. 'But at the moment we're moving 20 cases in a few days. 'A lot of the time it has been young customers buying them to do the ice bucket challenge.' A Tesco branch in South Shields, Tyneside, has also admitted running out of ice. Fun for all ages: Jack Reynolds, 102, from Chesterfield, completes the challenge, dressed in his Union flag boxer shorts. Lady Mary accepts the challenge: Downton's Michelle Dockery has water poured over her head. 'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well,' said Daniel Smith, duty manager of the Simonside Tesco. 'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on. 'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too. 'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.' Tesco has donated the profits from its ice cube sales to charity, and challenged other supermarkets to do the same after selling more than 36 million individual ice cubes over the last week. Far and wide: The ice bucket challenge has even made it to The Simpsons, with Homer taking part. Going global, and beyond: R2D2 gets doused with water on the set of the new Star Wars films. So far the retailer has donated £20,000 to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated competitors Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to follow suit. Tesco community director Greg Sage said: 'The ice bucket challenge has done an amazing job of raising awareness of motor neurone disease. An incredible number of people all over the world have taken part, including a huge number of Tesco colleagues. 'We've seen a big increase in sales of bags of ice as a direct result of this phenomenon, and we want the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association to be the ones to benefit. That's why today we've pledged to donate the extra profits we make to them, and we nominate Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to do the same.' A spokesman from a Sainsbury's branch in Fareham, Hampshire, said sales had doubled from usual hot summer figures as shoppers dashed to buy 'excessive' quantities of ice. Challenge: Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, accepts the Ice Bucket Challenge from Ryanair's Michael O Leary. Everyone's at it: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is among those who have undertaken the dare. Linda Langdon, the branch's public relations ambassador, said: 'We have been selling excessive amounts of ice and sold 60 bags in one shop in the space of about five hours. 'Compared to normal, it's double the amount we would have sold over the hot summer period.' A spokesman for Morrisons said customers struggling to find ice for their challenges can get a helping hand from the chain's fishmongers. 'Hundreds of our colleagues have also been doing the Ice Bucket Challenge in support of our charity partner, Sue Ryder,' she said. 'They care for people with long term conditions including MND at the end of their lives. So far this year we have raised almost £1m to support their fabulous work across the UK. 'If customers would also like to help by doing their own Ice Bucket Challenge, they don’t need to pay for ice – they can get it for free from our fishmongers, just ask.' Announcement: Actor Chris O'Dowd (left) and his wife Dawn O'Porter (right) used their challenge video to announce they were expecting a baby. The ice bucket challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go. More than £2.7million has been raised for the Motor Neurone Disease Association so far and the figure is rising daily as more people are nominated. Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association, said: 'The ice bucket challenge is an amazing and unprecedented opportunity to raise awareness of what is a devastating terminal disease.' The charity does not have figures on how many people are undertaking the challenge and donating per day, but since August 10 when the charity's ice bucket JustGiving page was set up 546,553 people have donated through the site, an average of more than 30,000 a day, with thousands more using the text number. In the last two weeks, MND Association has also received more than 17,000 new likes on Facebook and 6,000 new followers on Twitter. Cool customer: Singer Kylie Minogue takes part in the ice bucket challenge. On Tuesday the charity website was visited by 153,000 people, compared with the 1,400 who visit on an average day. However, a poll of 1,528 British adults has found that more than half of those who undertook the challenge did not donate to charity. Around half of those quizzed by VoucherCodesPro said they had done the challenge, but 53per cent admitted they had not donated. According to The Independent, more than one in three people said they had taken part solely to get attention on social media, and one in ten said they had only done the challenge as they felt pressure to do so having been nominated. Just 16 per cent said they had given between £1 and £3 to charity, and 3 per cent gave more than £10. 'Maybe not everyone who has done the Ice Bucket Challenge has donated, but a huge number have,' said Douglas Graham, Director of Fundraising for the MND Association. 'Last year in total we received 161,000 donations and in the last week alone we have had more than half a million donations adding up to around £3 million and that’s still rising. 'And while some people will just throw the water over their head we know thousands have come on our website or social media channels and found out about ALS or MND. As a relatively rare disease raising awareness is almost as important as raising funds, so we couldn’t be more pleased.' In the U.S., where the challenge originated, challengers have been urged to support the ALS Association, which supports those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease - a type of motor neurone disease. ALS is used as the umbrella term for the disease in the U.S., whereas in Britain it is MND. Since the end of July, the ALS Association, a sister charity to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, has received 94.3million (around £56.8million) in donations compared to 2.7million (£1.6million) during the same time period last year. A spokesman said: 'These donations have come from existing donors and 2.1 million new donors. 'The ALS Association is tremendously thankful for all of the generous support and awareness that this summer phenomenon has generated for the cause.'

Question: Who is the full size friend and customer, that Franz has to deal with? Movie title: Attack of the Puppet People Movie plot: The film begins with a Brownie troop visiting a doll manufacturing company called Dolls Inc., owned and operated by the seemingly kindly Mr. Franz (John Hoyt). As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished. Although she is concerned about his obsession with his dolls, she reluctantly agrees to take the job. She soon meets a traveling salesman, Bob Westley (John Agar), who introduces himself as the best salesman in St. Louis and immediately sets about attempting to seduce her. Their relationship become serious enough that Bob persuades Sally to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz. The next day however, Franz informs Sally that Bob has gone back home to take care of business and that she should forget him. She, however, is unwilling to accept this and goes to the police with a theory about Franz' role in her boyfriend's disappearance (\\"He made Bob into a doll!\\"), but Sergeant Paterson (Jack Kosslyn) is skeptical. Franz has developed a machine which can shrink people down to a sixth of their original size. He then uses it on anyone who tries to leave him. When he finds that Sally plans to quit, she becomes his latest victim. Franz has already miniaturized at least four other \\"friends\\". They are stored in suspended animation (which he has also invented) in glass jars in a display case in his office. After a reunion between Sally and Bob, Franz reveals how the process works and why he miniaturizes people (it seems that he developed a strong phobia against being alone after his wife left him). Periodically, Franz awakens his captives to enjoy parties he throws for them. During a welcoming party for the two newcomers, Franz has to deal with full-size friend and customer Emil (Michael Mark).

Nancy's father also wants to use this time as a way to stop his daughter's sleuthing as he finds it to be dangerous, and encourage her to focus on high school and living like a normal teenager. But unbeknownst to Carson, Nancy chose their California house because its previous owner, Dehlia Draycott, was a movie star who disappeared for several months before being murdered during a house party and found in her pool.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft. - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The PZL.48 Lampart ( Leopard ) was a Polish heavy fighter - bomber design , that remained only a project , owing to the outbreak of World War II. - A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance. The dedicated light bomber disappeared as fighters, due to advancements in powerplants and aircraft design, were eventually able to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also carrying out other missions and roles. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - A fighter-bomber is a fighter aircraft that has been modified, or used primarily, as a light bomber or attack aircraft. It differs from bomber and attack aircraft primarily in its origins, as a fighter that has been adapted into other roles, whereas bombers and attack aircraft are developed specifically for bombing and attack roles. - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.

Answer:","completion":"The original founder and editor of The Weekly Standard, William Kristol, was born on December 23, 1952."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Q: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head or not. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. For example, why one has to walk could be explained by a car has broken down. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Head: run out of steam<sep>Tail: have exerted physical energy A:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying the Head and Tail phrases. Usage: In the phrase 'run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy', \\"run out of steam\\" is the Head and \\"have exerted physical energy\\" is the Tail. This is because they are separated by the \\"<sep>\\" identifier. Part #2: Understanding that participants' specific names are replaced with generic words. Usage: Let's consider the phrase - \\"PersonX is tired<sep>PersonX worked all day\\". Here, PersonX is used as a generic word instead of a specific person. It means that this task can be applied to any person, not just one individual. Part #3: Recognizing that PersonX is the subject of the event. Usage: In the previous example ('PersonX is tired<sep>PersonX worked all day'), PersonX is the subject of both the Head and the Tail events. They are the central character involved in these events. Part #4: Determining whether the Tail is the reason for the Head Usage: Looking back at our phrase \\"run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy\\", we see that having exerted physical energy (Tail) is indeed a plausible reason for running out of steam (Head). Therefore, in this case, the answer would be \\"Yes\\". Part #5: Understanding a 'reason' as a post-fact explanation or cause. Usage: To further explain the previous example, running out of steam is the event that occurred (post-fact). The cause for this event, as provided by the Tail, is that the person had exerted physical energy. Part #6: Classifying your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". Usage: In our example (\\"run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy\\"), the answer would be classified as \\"Yes\\" because having exerted physical energy can be considered as a reason for running out of steam. Part #7: Understanding the use of placeholders \\"___\\". Usage: Let's consider the phrase \\"PersonX hugged ___<sep>___ was sad\\". Here \\"___\\" could be another person (like PersonY) or an animal (like a dog). The important aspect here is to know that something was sad and that's why PersonX hugged it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: offended, excited, generous afterwards A:","completion":"In the given context, it is likely that the reactions of others in the class may vary, as different people have different preferences and perspectives. However, below are some possibilities based on the three suggested emotions: 1. Offended: Some individuals might feel offended because they could interpret the offer of singing lessons as a judgment on their current singing abilities. They may think that the person signing them up believes they are not good enough and require improvement. 2. Excited: On the other hand, many students might be excited about the opportunity to learn and improve their singing skills. They may view it as a chance to explore a new talent or develop a hobby. The excitement may stem from the prospect of being part of a group activity or simply enjoying the experience of learning something new. 3. Generous afterwards: After participating in the singing lessons, the students might feel grateful for the opportunity they were given and inspired to reciprocate the kindness. This generosity could manifest in various ways, such as the class organizing a group event to show their appreciation or paying the gesture forward by signing someone else up for a class or workshop. Therefore, while it is impossible to predict with certainty how each individual will react, it is possible that some may feel offended, while others may feel excited, and still others might be generous afterwards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The asteroids would cause catastrophic damage, on a city-sized scale or larger. Research from the University of Southhampton has identified the countries most likely to be worst hit. They have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover. Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer has sampled 107 'potentially hazardous' asteroids near Earth - 330ft wide or larger - to make estimates about how many are out there - and the figure is a terrifying 47,000. Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer has sampled 107 'potentially hazardous asteroids' - PHAs - as shown in this diagram illustrating their orbits crossing Earth Findings indicate there are roughly 4,700","completion":"potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) with diameters larger than 330 feet (100 meters) that could pose a significant threat to Earth. These PHAs have orbits around the Sun that come within 4.7 million miles (7.5 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit and pose a potential risk of impacting our planet. The estimated number of 47,000 potentially hazardous asteroids mentioned in the question refers to the overall number of near-Earth asteroids, which includes both larger and smaller objects. The countries most likely to be worst hit by an asteroid impact are those with a large population and high infrastructure density, and those situated in vulnerable geographic locations. Based on these factors, countries such as the United States, China, India, Japan, and countries in Europe are at a higher risk of catastrophic damage and loss of life from an asteroid impact. The immediate effects of an asteroid impact would depend on the size, composition, and speed of the asteroid, as well as the location of the impact on Earth. An asteroid impact on a city-sized scale could result in: 1. Immediate destruction of buildings and infrastructure: The force of the impact would cause buildings to collapse, roads to be destroyed, and essential services like power, water, and sewage systems to be rendered inoperable. The affected area could extend for many miles beyond the impact site. 2. Shockwave and blast wave: The impact of an asteroid would generate an immense shockwave and blast wave, traveling through the air and ground. These waves could cause further destruction by shattering windows, knocking down walls, and toppling trees, potentially extending damage far beyond the initial impact site. 3. Fireball and subsequent fires: The intense heat generated by the impact would create a massive fireball, igniting fires in the surrounding area. These fires could merge, creating a massive firestorm that consumes everything in its path and releases large amounts of smoke and ash into the atmosphere. 4. Tidal waves or tsunamis: If the asteroid impact occurred in or near a body of water, it could generate enormous waves, flooding coastal areas and causing significant damage to life and property. Long-term consequences of an asteroid impact could include: 1. Disruption of food supplies: The destruction of agricultural land, fisheries, and transportation infrastructure would disrupt food supplies, leading to food shortages and potential famine. 2. Economic collapse: The massive loss of life, infrastructure, and resources would have dire consequences for the global economy, leading to widespread unemployment, economic recession, and potential collapse. 3. Climate change: The release of vast amounts of dust and debris into the atmosphere could lead to significant climate change, with potential effects such as reduced sunlight, lower temperatures, and disrupted weather patterns. 4. Disease and poor sanitation: The destruction of healthcare and sanitation infrastructure, along with the displacement of large populations, could lead to the spread of disease and poor public health conditions. To mitigate these potential catastrophic effects, international cooperation and initiatives are essential. Governments and space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have established programs to track and monitor near-Earth objects and develop technologies and strategies for asteroid impact prevention, such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA). Public awareness and preparedness are also crucial, as well as investment in research, development, and infrastructure to minimize human and economic losses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - opening one's mouth - listening - translator - voice - language The answer is \\"language\\" because The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"language\\" because language is an essential tool for communication and the foundation for effective conversations between two people. It goes beyond simply opening one's mouth or using a voice; language allows both parties to understand one another, share thoughts, feelings, and ideas, and to build connections and relationships. Let us explore the relevance and importance of language with regards to each aspect mentioned in the options: 1. Opening one's mouth: While opening one's mouth is vital for speaking, it does not guarantee effective communication if two people do not share a common language. Being able to pronounce words and speak aloud is only a small aspect of conversing, as understanding and comprehension are crucial for genuine dialogue. This can only be achieved if the individuals are familiar with the language being spoken. 2. Listening: Active listening is undoubtedly an integral part of effective communication. However, without a shared language, one may only hear sounds and words without truly grasping the meaning or intent behind them. The language barrier can turn an otherwise engaging conversation into a confusing or frustrating experience. 3. Translator: A translator can indeed help two people communicate effectively if they do not share a common language. BUT, relying on a translator might not convey the original meaning accurately and may hinder one's ability to express themselves fluently and spontaneously. While translators can bridge some gaps, they cannot replace the authenticity and connection brought about by communicating directly in a common language. 4. Voice: The human voice brings emotions and tone into conversations, adding depth to the words being spoken. However, similar to opening one's mouth, having a voice alone cannot guarantee effective communication. It is essential to be able to express oneself using the right words, phrases, and sentences in a language that both parties understand. The content and meaning of the conversation rely on the language used. 5. Language: Language serves as a medium and platform for communication between people. It consists of a structured system of words, phrases, grammar rules, and pronunciation, enabling individuals to convey their thoughts, emotions, and intentions with clarity. Two people need to know and understand a shared language to engage in meaningful and effective conversations. The understanding of cultural context, idiomatic expressions, and the nuances of that language further enhances the effectiveness of the communication. In conclusion, knowing a shared language is essential for two people to talk to each other effectively. It allows them to understand one another clearly, engage in constructive exchanges, and establish connections that go beyond simple verbal expressions. Language enables effective communication by providing the structure to express thoughts, feelings, and ideas and fostering understanding, empathy, and rapport between people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

The media giant Disney operates in the realm of entertainment, business, and media industry, making it a significant topic in the corporate world. The issue of Ovitz's \\"wacky ideas\\" for employee bonding demonstrates how critical leadership style and team dynamics can be in a large business environment like Disney. Michael Ovitz, a well-known personality in the business world, rose to prominence with his talent management company, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which he co-founded. His transition to Disney, however, reportedly did not go as smoothly according to a former executive. This creates the opportunity to discuss the importance of effective communication, company culture, and management ideologies within a business organization. One of Disney's core tenets is prioritizing its employees. As a result, the bonding activities and team-building experiences proposed by leaders like Michael Ovitz are vital for fostering a sense of unity and belonging among employees. Achieving this balance is crucial for the company's overall success and growth. However, the \\"wacky ideas\\" proposed by Ovitz potentially clashed with both the existing corporate norms and the expectations of Disney's employees. The allegation that Ovitz was unable to fit in at the company serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of aligning leadership values with company values and mission, all the more relevant in the world of business. Moreover, this article illuminates the challenges leaders might face when transitioning to a new company with a distinct culture and legacy, like Disney. It highlights the importance of adapting one's leadership style in sync with the values and demands of the new organization, as well as the implications this may have on both employee satisfaction and the overall success of a business. In summary, this article deals with the business domain, focusing on the aspects of leadership, corporate culture, and employee relations within the context of Michael Ovitz's time at Disney. The challenges that arise when an influential figure like Ovitz struggles to integrate with an established corporate culture underpin the broader theme of effective management and its impact on a company's performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate the following sentence to Finnish: The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority.","completion":"Komission pitäisi olla hajautettu, jotta henkilöstö voisi käyttää vastuuta ja valtaa. In Finnish: Komission = The Commission Pitäisi olla = Should be Hajautettu = Decentralised Jotta = In order to Henkilöstö = Staff Voisi = Could Käyttää = Exercise Vastuuta ja valtaa = Responsibility and authority So, the complete translation of \\"The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority.\\" is \\"Komission pitäisi olla hajautettu, jotta henkilöstö voisi käyttää vastuuta ja valtaa.\\" As Finnish is an agglutinative language, where words may have multiple morphemes indicating grammatical relationships, the sentence structure can appear different from English. Also, Finnish word order is flexible, primarily used for emphasis rather than for determining the meaning of the sentence. However, in this specific sentence, the word order closely matches the English original. In this translation: - \\"Komission\\" is a straightforward translation of \\"the Commission\\". - \\"Pitäisi olla\\" translates as \\"should be\\", indicating a suggestion or recommendation. - \\"Hajautettu\\", means \\"decentralised\\", referring to a distribution of functions or powers away from a central location or authority. - \\"Jotta\\" is a conjunction that translates as \\"in order to\\", indicating the purpose of decentralising the Commission. - \\"Henkilöstö\\" is a direct translation for \\"staff\\", referring to the group of people who work for the Commission. - \\"Voisi\\" is the conditional form of the verb \\"voida\\" (can), meaning \\"could\\". - \\"Käyttää\\" means \\"to exercise\\", in the sense of employing or applying something, in this case responsibility and authority. - \\"Vastuuta\\" and \\"valtaa\\" are the partitive forms of the nouns \\"vastuu\\" (responsibility) and \\"valta\\" (authority).

The hypothesis suggests that \\"more people are asserting their rights as individuals rather than as groups.\\" This means that a growing number of people are championing their rights at a personal level, as opposed to being part of a larger group advocating for their shared rights. Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and hypothesis highlight the idea that there is a shift in the way people are asserting their rights – moving from collective efforts to individual actions. The premise is based on an observation, and the hypothesis is a statement that seems to be in line with the observation. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis The premise that individual people are speaking out for their rights more than massing together supports the hypothesis that more people are asserting their rights individually rather than as part of a group. The premise implies a growing trend of individual action, which corresponds to the hypothesis. Step 4: Conclusion Given the premise that more people are speaking out for their own rights and not joining larger groups, it can be concluded that this premise does entail the hypothesis that more people are asserting their rights as individuals rather than as groups.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.

What is the answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? from the following article ? In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\".

The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called \\"a genius driven by emotion\\".

Summarize: The governor of Homs province, Talal Barazi, said government forces were now regrouping outside the ancient city, preparing to launch a fresh assault. IS held the city from May 2015 until it was forced out in March this year. Correspondents say IS appears to have taken advantage of the government's focus on Aleppo, further north. Mr Barazi confirmed the withdrawal from Palmyra but insisted \\"the army is using all means to prevent the terrorists from staying\\". Activists in the city said militants were going door to door looking for any remaining forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. IS re-entered the city and its nearby ancient ruins - a Unesco World Heritage site - on Saturday, after launching an offensive earlier in the week. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday morning that \\"intense\\" bombing from Russian planes had forced IS to withdraw to the orchards on the city's outskirts. The Russian defence ministry said it had carried out 64 strikes during the operation, and claimed to have killed more than 300 militants. The Syrian army has also sent reinforcements to the city, reportedly diverting troops from Aleppo. The observatory later reported that militants had again fought their way into the town, forcing government forces to retreat to the south. Reports said IS militants had attacked with suicide car bombs and artillery. Palmyra is seen as strategic for IS because it lies close to oilfields. IS destroyed a number of monuments and beheaded the archaeological director during its 10-month occupation of the site and the adjacent city of Tadmur. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. Maamoun Abdulkarim, a Syrian official for antiquities, said the contents of Palmyra's museum had been transferred to Damascus but he feared for the safety of the ancient ruins. \\"I fear they will be more vengeful,\\" he told the Associated Press. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous. The latest battle in Palmyra happened as the Syrian army closed in on the remaining rebel-held area of the city of Aleppo. Rebel forces said on Saturday that they had halted the advance of government forces in the pockets they still control in Aleppo. One rebel commander said a reason for the slowed government advance could be the redeployment of troops to Palmyra. However, the Syrian government has been continuously advancing on the rebel areas, backed by Russian air support, and now reportedly controls 93% of the city. A rebel official told Reuters news agency that his forces faced \\"death or surrender\\" as their area of control continued to shrink. On Saturday, US Secretary of State John Kerry called on the Syrian government and the Russian military to \\"show a little grace\\" as they mopped up the remaining rebel-held areas of Aleppo. US and Russian officials are continuing talks in Geneva over the possible evacuation of civilians and rebel fighters from Aleppo, but analysts say an agreement looks unlikely. Summary:","completion":"ISIS militants have re-entered the ancient city of Palmyra, with government forces regrouping outside, preparing for another assault. It is suggested that ISIS took advantage of the government's focus on Aleppo, further north. When the group had held the city from May 2015 to March 2016, they destroyed numerous monuments and beheaded the archaeological director.

Each new season brings its own records and achievements, and the competition amongst quarterbacks is fierce. Nevertheless, it is essential to pay homage to the incredible accomplishments of those who have etched their names in the annals of NFL history. One such performance is the fourth longest touchdown pass, a remarkable display of skill and precision on the field. In this article, we will unveil the player responsible for this exceptional play and delve into the significance of this seemingly unsurpassable achievement.

Patrick's innate talent in sports was evident from a young age, as he excelled in multiple sports, including football, basketball, and baseball. Ultimately, Mahomes decided to focus on football and, after a stellar high school career and a successful tenure at Texas Tech University, entered the NFL for the 2017 season as the 10th overall draft pick by the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes' rise to fame has been incredibly rapid, yet well-deserved, as he has displayed exceptional talent and skill in the quarterback position. Within his first few years in the league, he became the youngest quarterback to reach 10,000 passing yards, a Super Bowl MVP, and a Pro Bowler. These accolades, along with many others, have solidified Mahomes' status as one of the most formidable talents in the NFL today. The Significance of the Fourth Longest Touchdown Pass in NFL History The fourth longest touchdown pass is an exceptional achievement that speaks volumes about the skill, precision, and power required from a quarterback.

Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice. - The Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices was awarded from 1977 to 1986. From 1977 to 1981 it was called the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement for Voices. The award is presented to the arranger of the music. - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble.

It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. The term \\"a cappella\\" was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.

Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

Q: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. China's landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions,\\" the Pentagon statement said. \\"We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,\\" the statement added. \\"We believe these recent deployments and the continued... Question: After the end of the text, how will the public view of China's military change? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","completion":"The public view of China's military is likely to experience a shift as a result of their exclusion from the international maritime exercise and their activities in the South China Sea. However, the extent and nature of this change will vary among different groups and individuals, depending on their stance on the issues encompassing regional security, international relations, and geopolitical concerns. For those who perceive China's militarization of disputed territories in the South China Sea as a threat to regional stability, the exclusion from the RIMPAC exercise and the Pentagon's statement on China's actions further reinforces a negative view of China's military. These individuals may see China as increasingly aggressive, expansionist, and unwilling to cooperate with international norms and dispute resolution mechanisms. As a result, this group will likely advocate for stronger actions to counter China's assertiveness and restore a perceived balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, some people may view China's exclusion from the international maritime exercise as an unnecessary provocation by the United States, further straining already fragile U.S.-China relations. This group may see the U.S. move as an attempt to isolate and contain China, while undermining regional peace and stability. They may argue that by excluding China from the RIMPAC exercise, the U.S. is not promoting cooperation and dialogue, but instead perpetuating a negative cycle of competitive behavior in the region. Additionally, there are those who interpret this event as a clear signal of shifting geopolitical dynamics that may require further ongoing assessment. They may advocate for a balanced approach that recognizes the potential threats posed by China's growing military capabilities, while also emphasizing the necessity of engaging in diplomatic efforts to promote regional stability and cooperation. In conclusion, the public view of China's military is likely to change as a result of the events described, with differing perspectives arising from various concerns and priorities. Some may view China as a growing threat to be countered, others may see the U.S. measures as further escalating tensions, and still, others may take a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the evolving geopolitical landscape. Ultimately, the changes in public perception of China's military will depend on the shifting balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region, the outcome of diplomatic efforts, and the ability of relevant parties to effectively manage and resolve their differences in the interest of regional peace and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sleep more.\\"","completion":"Title: The Comprehensive Guide to a Healthy Lifestyle: Eating, Vitamins, Hydration, Exercise, and Sleep Introduction In the race of life, staying healthy and fit is of utmost importance. A balanced lifestyle with proper nutrition, hydration, exercise, and sleep is the key to achieving this goal. However, it often seems that our lives are ruled by an endless list of tasks and responsibilities that can make sticking to healthy habits quite challenging. This article aims to break down each vital component of a healthy lifestyle, guiding you on the path towards better overall well-being. 1. Eat five to nine servings of vegetables per day Various studies have reiterated the importance of incorporating a healthy serving of vegetables into your daily diet. Vegetables are a rich source of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that boost your immune system, help maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. To ensure you are getting enough vegetables each day, try the following tips: - Include a variety of vegetables in your daily meals to gain maximum benefits - Begin your day with a vegetable-packed smoothie or incorporate greens into your breakfast - Choose vegetable-based snacks, like carrot sticks with hummus or cucumbers with Greek yogurt - Add extra vegetables to your main meals like salads, stir-fries, and soups 2. Eat lean proteins Lean proteins provide essential amino acids that support muscle growth and repair, regulate appetite, and boost energy levels. They are also known to improve cardiovascular health, decrease obesity, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Some excellent sources of lean proteins include poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, and low-fat dairy products. Here are a few ways to include lean proteins in your daily meals: - Plan your meals around a lean protein source, such as grilled chicken, fish, or tofu - Replace processed meat in sandwiches or wraps with natural, lean protein options - Add beans or legumes to salads and soups for a low-fat, high-protein alternative 3. Consider a multivitamin supplement with vitamin B12 and folate While a well-balanced diet should provide all the necessary nutrients, it's not always possible to get everything we need through food alone. In such cases, a multivitamin supplement containing essential vitamins like B12 and folate could play a beneficial role. These vitamins are significant for maintaining healthy nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation and choose a high-quality supplement from a reputable source. 4. Drink more water Proper hydration is a crucial aspect of overall health. Adequate water intake helps regulate body temperature, transport nutrients, and remove waste products. It also plays a role in cognitive function, digestion, and heart health. Here are a few tips to stay well-hydrated throughout the day: - Carry a reusable water bottle with you at all times - Set reminders on your phone or use an app to track your water intake - Replace sugary drinks with water, herbal tea, or sugar-free alternatives 5. Reduce your activity level While exercise is essential for our physical and mental well-being, over-exercising can lead to exhaustion, injury, and weaken immune function. Rather than pushing yourself excessively, follow a balanced approach that includes low-impact workouts such as walking, swimming, yoga, or pilates, combined with more vigorous activities like running or strength training. Adequate rest days are also necessary for your body to recover. 6. Sleep more Sleep is a restorative process crucial for memory consolidation, immune system function, and metabolic regulation. Adults generally need between seven to nine hours of sleep each night to reap maximum benefits. Here are some tips to improve your sleep quality: - Establish a regular sleep schedule and stick to it, even on weekends - Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation - Reduce exposure to screens before bedtime to avoid the harmful effects of blue light on sleep - Make your sleep environment comfortable, dark, and quiet Conclusion The journey to a healthy lifestyle does not have to be arduous. By incorporating the guidelines mentioned above, you can take small but impactful steps towards better nutrition, hydration, exercise, and sleep routines. Remember, the key is consistency. Stay committed to your health goals, and soon these habits will transform into lasting lifestyle changes with visible benefits to your overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Surrounded by willows and ragged spruces, the conical tepees rose in the plain beneath, but Blake stopped abruptly as he caught sight of them. They were white to the apex, where the escaping heat of the fire within generally melted the snow, and no curl of smoke floated across the clearing.

Plot title: Twister Movie plot: In June 1969, 5-year-old Jo Thornton (Alexa Vega), her parents, and the family dog Toby seek shelter in their family storm cellar as a powerful F5 tornado hits their farm in Oklahoma. This tornado is so strong that the storm cellar door is ripped off, causing Jo's father (Richard Lineback) to be pulled into the storm to his death. Jo, her mother (Rusty Schwimmer), and Toby survive. 27 years later in 1996, 32-year-old Jo (Helen Hunt), now a meteorologist, is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Harding (Bill Paxton), a former weather researcher and storm chaser, who has since become a weather reporter. He is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz). They need Jo's signature on the divorce papers and have tracked her down during an active bout of stormy weather. Jo has built four identical tornado research devices called DOROTHY, based on Bill's designs. The device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure from the inside, with the purpose of creating a more advanced storm warning system. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her team of storm chasers, and the team encounters Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), a smug, corporate-funded meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has created a device based on DOROTHY, called DOT-3, he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. During the first tornado, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both destroyed (the truck is picked up and lands upside-down). They continue storm chasing in Bill's truck, with Melissa in the back seat. They find a second tornado, a confirmed F2, and head off on a back road when the twister shifts its track. They soon find themselves driving through heavy rain, and instead collide with a cluster of two violent waterspouts, one of which splits, spinning them around on the highway until the waterspouts dissipate. They're fine, but Melissa becomes hysterical from the ordeal, and Bill has to calm her down. The team... My question: WHAT FILM IS SHOWING AT THE DRIVE-IN WHEN THE F4 TORNADO HITS?

In a decision filed Thursday by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., a three-judge panel declared the U.S. Forest Service \\"abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources\\" when it issued permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to build through parts of the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests and a right of way across the Appalachian Trail. \\"This conclusion,\\" they wrote in a unanimous judgment, \\"is particularly informed by the Forest Service's serious environmental concerns that were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company's deadlines.\\" The judges cited Dr. Seuss' The Lorax: \\"We trust the United States Forest Service to 'speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.'\\" The court concluded that the Forest Service's decisions violated both the National Forest Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and found the Forest Service lacked the authority to grant the pipeline a right of way across the Appalachian Trail. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline would originate in West Virginia and stretch across Virginia and North Carolina (here's a map). As the judges detail, the project would make a considerable impact on the landscape: \\"Construction would involve clearing trees and other vegetation from a 125-foot right of way (reduced to 75 feet in wetlands) through the national forests, digging a trench to bury the pipeline, and blasting and flattening ridgelines in mountainous terrains. Following construction, the project requires maintaining a 50-foot right of way (reduced to 30 feet in wetlands) through the [two national forests] for the life of the pipeline.\\" They note that in 2015, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to conduct an environmental impact statement on the project, the Forest Service noted concerns about landslides and slope failures, as well as impact on groundwater, soil, and endangered species. A draft of FERC's environmental impact statement stated that the pipeline route was designed to go through national forest lands rather than National Park Service lands, as the latter which would likely necessitate congressional approval. The Southern Environmental Law Center was one of the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit challenging the Forest Service's issuance of the permits. \\"I think what happened here is for years the Forest Service was asking tough questions about this project and requesting additional information and it turned on a dime when the Trump administration came into power,\\" Patrick Hunter, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, told West Virginia Public Broadcasting. \\"Federal agencies can change their minds, but they have to [have] good reasons for doing it and they didn't have a good reason to change their mind and turn on a dime like this and I think that came through in this decision-making.\\" \\"The pipeline route that Dominion has chosen cannot be approved as of right now, and so if they want to keep working on this thing, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board,\\" Hunter told the broadcaster. \\"All of the agencies that have to issue approvals for this pipeline — their approvals depend on this one pipeline route. And since that can no longer be built as planned, I think that calls all of those other approvals into question.\\" Dominion Energy, the pipeline's lead developer, said it will appeal immediately to the full appeals court. \\"If allowed to stand, this decision will severely harm consumers and do great damage to our economy and energy security,\\" Aaron Ruby, a spokesman for Dominion Energy, said in a statement to NPR. \\"Public utilities are depending on this infrastructure to meet the basic energy needs of millions of people and businesses in our region.\\" According to Ruby, 56 other oil and gas pipelines already cross the Appalachian Trail — a few of them more than once. Natural gas pipelines are buried. From ground level, hikers would see a marker (like this one) alerting them to the pipeline under their boots, and a gap where the trees had been clear-cut. No trees are permitted to grow over top of a pipeline, because their roots can damage it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I wish I could give this place less than one star. It was easily the worst experience of my life! Let me just start by saying that I had completely virgin hair. I had NEVER dyed it before in my life. I went here because my mother claimed it was a great place. It was very posh. They served me iced tea in a wine glass. I just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists. Wendy, was younger than I was, and had an attitude with me from the start. I told her that I wanted to go light blonde (think lady gaga or christina aguilera). I'm a natural brunette. She instantly told me that it would look terrible and that she refused to do it. Then she continued to have every single stylist in the place back her up and tell me how stupid I was for wanting it. Finally she said she would do me a few shades lighter and since my mother suggested her, I decided to just go with it. Instead of making me a few shades lighter she proceeded to give me orange and yellow streaks in my dark brown hair. Halfway through she started cutting and styling another womans hair (even though I had an appointment and she didn't.) I had to sit for about an hour reading (not under a dryer) while she finished up the other woman. By the time she was done with me I was devastated. She asked me what was wrong and i said \\"Well it's not blonde enough and I don't really like highlights. I told you this.\\" She took a piece of the yellow she made and said, \\"THIS ISNT BLONDE TO YOU? ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS ISNT BLONDE!?\\" Then took me around the entire salon and had every stylist tell me that it looked amazing and I was a \\"hot blonde\\". Every single stylist then told me how horrible what I wanted would have looked and that I should be thankful that Wendy did what she wanted instead of listening to me. I felt horribly bullied and left there 200 dollars poorer and covered in embarrassing orange and yellow stripes. I spent weeks wearings hats and headbands to cover up the horrible mistake. It wasn't just the bad hair job, because I could have understood that. But it was the fact that she insulted me and bullied me the entire time and then proceeded to give me the opposite of what I asked for. Why didn't she just tell me from the beginning that she couldn't help me? It would have saved me the 400+ that it cost to correct the mistake she made.

Stanley opened the scoring after 10 minutes when Kayden Jackson got the ball in the box from Janoi Donacien, turned and slotted it low into the far corner of the net. It was former Barnsley frontman Jackson's fourth goal in three league games. Mansfield equalised after 25 minutes when Danny Rose flicked the ball over keeper Aaron Chapman and it fell to Lee Angol, who had the easy task of firing into an empty net for his first Stags goal. It was a fiery first half with Paul Digby and Zander Diamond both off-target for Mansfield, while Omar Beckles headed wide for Stanley. After the break, both sides had chances to win it with Mansfield's Krystian Pearce heading wide from a corner while, at the other end, Mark Hughes headed over and Jackson had a goalbound shot blocked before Kee popped up with the winner.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Here's a logic test: Supposed you were standing on the planet Earth and Mercury. When you look up in the sky and see the sun which planet would the sun appear larger? (A) Mercury (B) Earth Choose the answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Earth\\". Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"Mercury.\\" To understand why, we need to consider the distance between each planet and the Sun, as well as their relative positions in the solar system. The sun's apparent size in the sky is determined by its angular diameter, which depends on its actual diameter and its distance from the observer. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with an average distance of approximately 57.91 million kilometers (35.98 million miles). Earth, on the other hand, is located at an average distance of about 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the Sun. This difference in distance means that Mercury is about 2.6 times closer to the Sun than Earth. When you observe the Sun from Mercury, its apparent size would be larger due to the closer proximity. The angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Mercury is roughly 3.2 times larger than as seen from Earth. The formula to calculate the angular diameter is: Angular Diameter = (Actual Diameter / Distance) × (180 / Pi) Using this formula, the angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Mercury would be: Angular Diameter = (1.391 million km / 57.91 million km) × (180 / 3.14159) ≈ 1.377 degrees And the Sun's angular diameter as seen from Earth would be: Angular Diameter = (1.391 million km / 149.6 million km) × (180 / 3.14159) ≈ 0.533 degrees Since 1.377 degrees is larger than 0.533 degrees, the Sun would appear larger when viewed from Mercury as compared to Earth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Could the Scottish Parliament stop the UK from leaving the EU? To recap. The Prime Minister has resigned. The leader of the opposition is resisting pressure from senior colleagues to follow suit. And, lest we forget in this temporary focus upon party leadership, the people of the United Kingdom have voted to leave the European Union after 43 years of membership. In these unprecedented circumstances, it is understandable that there is a degree of uncertainty in the immediate response to events. That disquiet includes Scotland where the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is seeking to draft a distinct reaction within the distinctive Scottish body politic. She has said that the people of Scotland have voted, clearly, to continue in membership of the European Union, with its attendant rights and responsibilities. It is her duty, she argues, to attempt to carry out that popular instruction. First things first. Is there such a mandate? Ms Sturgeon says yes. She says Scotland is a nation - although not presently a state. She is the elected political leader of that nation, constrained by that office to follow the wishes of her voters. How would you expect her, as a Nationalist, to say anything else? It is the fundamental creed of her cause that Scotland is distinct and merits distinctive treatment, within the limits of shared sovereignty and co-operation which characterise the modern SNP. Others of a Unionist persuasion say no. The Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, for example says that Scotland remained within the Union via the referendum of September 2014 - and that Scotland, consequently, is bound by UK collective decisions such as the vote on Thursday. Nigel Farage and David Coburn of UKIP put it more bluntly, in their customary fashion. They dismiss utterly Ms Sturgeon's elemental pitch. It was notable, however, that David Cameron stressed the involvement of the Scottish government and other devolved administrations in the EU negotiations to come. Boris Johnson, he who agitated for Leave, seemed almost plaintive when he said there was no reason why Brexit should cause any disturbance in the domestic Union. These, however, are differences of tone. Although such things matter, no Unionist will readily accept that Scotland should do anything other than submit to the declared will of the UK, as expressed in the vote on Thursday. That is, unless and until Scotland is an independent state. So what can Nicola Sturgeon do? She has said she will examine all options in consort with the European institutions and others to seek to secure continuing links with the EU for Scotland. One of those options would be a second independence referendum - in order to allow Scotland to join/rejoin the EU in her own right, as a sovereign state. But what about those other options? In particular, what about the suggestion that Ms Sturgeon might encourage the Scottish Parliament to seek to exercise a veto over the implementation of Brexit? This scenario is based upon an interpretation of the Scotland Act 1998, the statute which created (or, rather, recreated) the Scottish Parliament. Clause 29 of that Act, anent legislative competence, empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in the devolved areas for which it is responsible - while obliging it to take care that nothing it does is \\"incompatible\\" with EU law. In short, EU law has force in Scotland and, in devolved areas, is enacted and implemented by the Scottish Parliament, not Westminster. That has led constitutional experts, such as Sir David Edward to suggest that the consent of the Scottish Parliament would be required were it to be suggested that the UK's relationship with the EU, in legislation and other areas, might be altered. Sir David made this point in evidence to a House of Lords inquiry. Their Lordships report cited Sir David as envisaging that there might be \\"certain political advantages\\" to be drawn from withholding consent. Which is true. It is further true that it is an established Convention (formerly known as the Sewel Convention) that the Westminster Parliament should not interfere in devolved areas without the consent of Holyrood. Such agreement is customarily given via a legislative consent motion, LCM, at Holyrood. So does that mean Holyrood has a veto over Brexit? Up to a point, Lord Copper. Firstly, one should understand that relations with the EU have a long and complex history, in the context of the demands for self-government. A seat at the EU top table has long been a prize sought after by supporters of independence. Even those who backed devolution, rather than full independence, foresaw that Scotland would develop her own relations with the EU, in consort with the UK. Thus the White Paper of 1997 which led to the 1998 Act fudged the issue. It said that dealing with the EU was a matter for Westminster, alongside foreign affairs. But it suggested that the UK government would seek to consult the devolved administration in Scotland and take account of its views. Let us turn now to statute. The 1998 Act proceeds by specifying the issues which are reserved to Westminster - then grandly declaring that everything else is devolved. In that single little line is the subordinate nature of devolution. Generally, Westminster will let the Scottish Parliament get on with devolved legislation. Carry on governing. But it is also made clear that Westminster's ultimate sovereignty over the UK, the entire UK, is unaffected. So it could be argued - it is already being argued - that, if it came to a constitutional battle, Westminster would have the final say. Holyrood might withhold consent for the legislative moves to implement Brexit. Westminster might note such a verdict, no doubt with polite gratitude - then proceed to implement Brexit, exercising its over-riding sovereignty. Would that be wise? Would it be politically smart? Those are different questions, to discuss should this issue arise for real. To be clear, Nicola Sturgeon is not personally making a big deal of this. She is not issuing scatter-gun threats. She is attempting to remain calm, adopting the persona of one of the few serving leaders in these islands not resigning or under pressure to resign. To be clear, further, she did not float the issue of a \\"veto\\" on Friday in her formal response. It emerged today in reply to decidedly adept questioning from my estimable colleague, Gordon Brewer. Just as with the tone adopted by David Cameron and Boris Johnson, I think Ms Sturgeons' demeanour is significant. She is seeking to make slow, steady progress. In particular, she is not anxious to drive forward to an instant referendum on independence. Why not? Because she fears she might lose it. The big challenges she faced in September 2014 were: the economy, the currency and membership of the EU. The third factor has now altered somewhat, positing the prospect of indyref2. However, items one and two remain. What would independence do to the economy? What currency would an independent Scotland use? Further, still, it is possible that Brexit might encourage furious Scots - and many are decidedly angry - to move in greater numbers towards independence. Equally, it might make some think that the constitutional world is already scary and uncertain enough without revisiting the prospect of independence at this stage. Ms Sturgeon, as she has made amply plain, wants more evidence that the people of Scotland are ready this time round to back independence. So she wants time. She needs time. Hence, partly, the search for alternatives. The search for any means by which Scotland can maintain EU links. To be clear again, this is a genuine, governmental search. Ms Sturgeon is not bluffing or deploying guile. She, authentically, wants ideas as to how to proceed. Equally, however, she acknowledges that it may well be the case that there is nothing short of member state status which replicates, for Scotland, the EU links currently provided via the UK. She has not specified options - but let us speculate. What might be possible? Could Scotland gain a distinctive status as, in reverse, is the case with Greenland and the Faroes which are parts of the Kingdom of Denmark, yet not in membership of the EU? Well, maybe, although Scotland is decidedly different. The Scottish government are seeking to retain membership, once the member state of which they are part has left. Secondly, Scotland is an intrinsic part of the UK economy and the UK's treaty obligations. It might be thought difficult to disentangle Scotland's rights and obligations from the wider UK. It is possible to envisage a situation where distinctive status within Brexit is afforded to, say, Gibraltar. Scotland may be trickier. However, as one senior member of the UK Government said to me, Europe is all about the politics. The constitutionally impossible suddenly becomes feasible if the EU's leaders want it and need it. But would they? Politically, would they? It seems probable that the old objections would arise. That member states like Spain and Belgium would not want to encourage special status for Scotland which might, in very different circumstances, be demanded by their own autonomous provinces. Then what about associate membership status for Scotland, which has been floated? It is not clear what that would mean. How, for example, could rights and responsibility be accorded to Scotland without drafting new treaties which applied to Scotland alone? How would that fit with the removal of treaties affecting the UK? How could Scotland, for example, access the single market and retain freedom of movement for workers while remaining part of a political entity, the UK, which has withdrawn from those elements? I do not know. And, more importantly, Nicola Sturgeon does not know either, at this stage. To repeat, she is genuinely seeking answers. But, tactically, she is also buying time if it becomes evident that the only route to be pursued is that of independence via a second referendum. And now, the epilogue. Today Dr Russell Barr, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, has issued a prayer, to be used, if they so choose, by the Kirk's 800 Ministers. It concludes by seeking intercession to \\"free us from all bitterness and recrimination\\".","completion":"This news article is talking about some problems between Scotland and the United Kingdom (UK) after the UK voted to leave the European Union (EU).

In ancient Rome, what was the title of a magistrate who was next in importance to a consul?","completion":"In ancient Rome, the title of a magistrate who was next in importance to a consul was a \\"Praetor.\\" The office of the praetor emerged around 366 BCE to assist consuls with their increasing administrative and judicial responsibilities. At first, there was only one praetor, but as the Roman Republic expanded, the number of praetors grew. Eventually, around the 2nd century BCE, the number of praetors reached eight. Their main responsibilities included presiding over the administration of justice, both civil and criminal, as well as holding imperium, which granted them the authority to command military forces and govern provinces. Praetors had several key roles to play during their tenure. Firstly, they were responsible for the management of civil law cases in Rome, specifically dealing with disputes between Roman citizens (known as ius civile cases) and disputes between Roman citizens and non-citizens (known as ius gentium cases). The praetors' primary function was to ensure that justice was served and maintain law and order within the Roman state. One of the ways in which they accomplished this was by issuing edicts or praetorian law (edictum praetoris) at the beginning of their term, which set forth the legal procedures and rules they would follow during their time in office. Praetorian law was an important part of Roman law because it enabled the legal system to adapt to new circumstances and evolve over time. As such, the praetor's position was not only administrative but also held a significant legislative component. Secondly, praetors were also responsible for presiding over criminal cases. The two primary types of criminal courts at the time were the quaestiones perpetuae, which focused on a specific type of crime (e.g., murder or treason), and the extraordinary criminal courts (quaestiones extraordinariae), created to address urgent matters that did not fall under the purview of the quaestiones perpetuae. The praetor could play a key role in either court type, by either organizing the court, gathering evidence, or officiating over a trial. Thirdly, since the praetor held imperium, they shared military and political responsibilities with the consuls. This meant that they could be called upon to command armies in times of war or manage provinces in times of peace. While some military campaigns were led by the consuls, others would be delegated to a praetor. In addition, a praetor could also be appointed to govern a province, ensuring Roman laws were enforced, and Rome's interests were maintained in its territories. Such duties included managing taxation and provincial resources and maintaining order in the region. In summary, the praetor was a crucial figure in the Roman Republic who was second only to the consul in terms of power and importance. They played a significant role in maintaining law and order, overseeing both civil and criminal cases, and administrating justice. Furthermore, their duty to uphold Roman law and represent the interests of Rome in provinces or on the battlefield made the praetorian position integral to the functioning and expansion of the Republic."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York. The earliest models were made in 1954 and the last model was made in 1984. Since then the Wurlitzer electric piano sound has been recreated on digital keyboards, and the vintage models are sought by musicians and collectors. - Supertramp (known as Daddy in 196970) are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of founders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone. - Richard \\"Rick\\" Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as the founder, vocalist and keyboardist of progressive rock band Supertramp. Davies is the only member of Supertramp to have been with the group for their entire history, and has composed some of their most well-known songs, including \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"My Kind of Lady\\", and \\"Cannonball\\". He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics. - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep . He played for Bakerloo , but left the group following the release of its only album . He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp ( then called Daddy ) between late 1969 and early 1970 . Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury , replacing Nigel Olsson . He recorded the album with the group , but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clarke . - Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp. - Sir Elton Hercules John, (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.

Comprising various musical instruments, the band typically performs at school functions, sports events, and community gatherings, showcasing the culmination of hard work and dedicated practice. In a school setting, the band program will often consist of different ensembles, such as a concert band, jazz band, marching band, and pep band, allowing students with diverse skill levels and musical interests to participate. Each ensemble has its unique style and purpose, which contributes greatly to the overall vitality of the school community and encourages the students' artistic growth. The process of learning an instrument and participating in a school band requires immense dedication, as it involves regular practice, attending rehearsals, and refining individual techniques. Students often practice both independently and in an ensemble setting to improve their mastery of their chosen instruments. These sessions take place inside classrooms, gymnasiums, music rooms, and, sometimes, even outdoors, depending on the space and acoustic requirements. School bands place much emphasis on teamwork, as band members must work in harmony to achieve a balanced and cohesive sound. This encourages a supportive and inclusive environment, fostering strong bonds amongst the students, regardless of their age or grade level. Within the band, students also learn important life skills such as time management, goal setting, problem-solving, and accountability. Moreover, the band's leadership roles – such as section leaders, drum majors, and student conductors – help nurture students' confidence and organizational abilities. Performances are an integral part of the school band experience, as they allow the students to showcase their progress and artistic abilities. Through concerts, competitions, and parades, band students grow accustomed to working under pressure, receiving constructive feedback, and striving for excellence. Furthermore, they learn the importance of representing their school and community with poise and pride.

Here are possible answers to this question: - riots - wait in line - suffer pain - bank money - believe in god I believe the correct choice is \\"bank money\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"bank money\\", because acquiring things that people desire often involves purchasing or financially investing in them. Using bank money, which essentially means using one's savings, credit, or money from financial institutions, allows individuals to exchange currency for goods and services that they desire. The other options listed, such as riots, waiting in line, suffering pain, and believing in God, are not direct methods for acquiring desired items. Rioting, for example, is a form of social unrest and often damages property rather than helping an individual obtain what they desire. Waiting in line may involve patience and possibly result in the acquisition of specific items or services, but this option is limited in its scope and success. Suffering pain, which is a negative experience, does not directly relate to acquiring desired items. Finally, believing in God may provide spiritual and emotional support, but it is not a direct means of acquiring material possessions or goods. Therefore, using bank money is the most logical and effective choice for acquiring things that people desire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\". He further added that \\"Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.\\" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only.

Q: What is the simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties? Choices: - atom - molecule - quark - element A: A:","completion":"The simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties, based on the given paragraph, is an element. An element is a pure substance made up of only one type of atom, and it cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Each element has its distinctive set of properties, such as density, melting point, and boiling point, which are determined by the identity and arrangement of its atoms. These properties set it apart from other forms of matter and give it its unique characteristics. Let's briefly look at the other choices provided for a better understanding of why an element is the correct answer: - Atom: Atoms are the building blocks of matter, and they combine to form elements and compounds. While atoms are indeed the smallest units of matter that retain the chemical identity of a substance, they are not the simplest forms of matter with unique properties. The properties of an element are based on the combinations and behavior of its atoms. - Molecule: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms bonded together chemically. Molecules can be made up of atoms from the same element or different elements, forming compounds. Molecules themselves do not possess unique sets of properties but contribute to the properties of the substances they are part of. - Quark: Quarks are elementary particles and a fundamental constituent of matter. They are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which are found in the nucleus of atoms. Though quarks are simpler than atoms, they do not have unique sets of properties that define a specific type of matter, as elements do. Quarks are better understood in the context of particle physics, rather than in terms of defining the simplest form of matter with unique properties. In summary, given the context provided in the paragraph, the simplest form of matter that exhibits a unique set of properties is an element. Elements are distinguished by their distinct properties based on the identity and arrangement of their constituent atoms, setting them apart from other forms of matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Nando Reis (Portuguese pronunciation: ['nadu 'Rejs], born Jose Fernando Gomes dos Reis; January 12, 1963) is a Brazilian musician and producer, best known as the former bassist and one of the lead singers of Brazilian rock band Titas and for his successful solo career, with his own band called Os Infernais. He has also produced a few albums, including some related to Cassia Eller, who has made several significant partnerships with him, and Marisa Monte. In 2012, Nando Reis was listed among the top ten Brazilian artists at the ECAD list of artists who earned the most from copyright in the first semester of that year. Context: Nando Reis was born in Sao Paulo to Cecilia Leonel and Jose Carlos Galvao Gomes dos Reis. He was given his prename \\"Jose\\" just like his brothers, Jose Carlos, the oldest of the children, and Jose Luiz (who is deaf), the younger. His two sisters also shared the same prenames: Maria Cecilia, the older, and Maria Luiza, the youngest of the five, which developed cerebral palsy. His mother was an acoustic guitar teacher and his father was an engineer. Jose Carlos taught him a little bit of Rock 'n' Roll, showing him Rolling Stones's album Between the Buttons. Maria Cecilia taught him to play the acoustic guitar and took him to a show of Gal Costa and Gilberto Gil. He was given his first acoustic guitar by his grandmother, at the age of 7, and was taught his first chords by his sister. However, most of his skills were acquired alone, when he learned songs of Caetano Veloso all by himself. Some friends of Jose Carlos played in a rock band. Once, he took Nando to a small performance at the garage of the bassist house. Impressed with the solos of the guitarist, he asked him to teach him, but he never made it. He also tried the drums, but gave up. He decided then to play the bass guitar, as his attempts to play the electric guitar and the drums failed. Other artists, such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper kept joining his main influences. At the age of eleven, he had classes of classic guitar and harmony with Alexandre (\\"Maranhao\\"), a friend of Jose Carlos. His first compositions were all based on poems. Most of them were long, showing his appreciation for long songs. In 1978, he entered Equipe School. There, he formed a band called \\"Os Camaroes\\" (The Shrimps) with some friends, and managed to win a local music festival. When he met Paulo Miklos and Arnaldo Antunes, who took part of the festival, he made the first compositions with what would later become Titas. When the high school was over, he waited three years to pass the Mathematics vestibular. Even though Titas where already planning their first show, the university occupied most of his time.

I started by translating the first sentence, with \\"There cannot be any compromise on safety,\\" as \\"Emniyet konusunda herhangi bir taviz verilemez,\\". - \\"There cannot be any compromise\\" becomes \\"herhangi bir taviz verilemez\\". - \\"on safety\\" translates to \\"emniyet konusunda\\". 2. I translated the name \\"EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas\\" into \\"AB Ulaştırma Komiseri Siim Kallas\\". - EU stands for European Union, which is \\"Avrupa Birliği\\" in Turkish. I used \\"AB\\" which is the abbreviation for \\"Avrupa Birliği\\". - \\"Transport Commissioner\\" translates as \\"Ulaştırma Komiseri\\". 3. I put the day, \\"on Monday,\\" in the sentence with the translated words which gives, \\"Pazartesi günü AB Ulaştırma Komiseri Siim Kallas konuştu.\\" - \\"on Monday\\" becomes \\"Pazartesi günü\\". - \\"said\\" is translated as \\"konuştu\\" in Turkish and placed after the subject. 4.

The phrase itself does not provide enough context or information to make a clear judgment. This is because opinions will vary about how \\"harshness\\" is conveyed in a movie and whether it is a positive or negative aspect. In some cases, a reviewer might use the phrase \\"life's harshness\\" as a compliment to describe a film that realistically and effectively portrays the struggles and challenges faced by characters. Audiences might appreciate the movie's raw, authentic, and honest depiction of life's difficulties, which could evoke powerful emotions and promote a stronger connection with the characters. In this context, the phrase would convey a positive opinion since the movie successfully communicates the complexities of life and resonates with its viewers. On the other hand, the reviewer might use \\"life's harshness\\" as a criticism to express that the movie is overly bleak, depressing, or disturbing, making it an uncomfortable or unpleasant experience. This interpretation would suggest that the film's portrayal of harsh situations is too overwhelming and might detract from other aspects of the story, such as character development or plot progression. In this case, the phrase would convey a negative opinion, as the movie's focus on life's harshness is viewed as a detrimental aspect.

Movie title: Scream and Scream Again Context: The movie's structure is fragmented, as it alternates between three distinguishable plot threads. A man jogging through suburban London grabs his heart, and collapses. He wakes up in a hospital bed. The nurse tending him give him water. She leaves. He pulls down the bed covers to discover both his legs have been amputated. He screams. An official (Marshall Jones) from an unidentified Eastern European totalitarian state arrives back at his home country. Upon being debriefed by a superior officer, the man steps around the table, places a hand on the man's shoulder, paralyzes him, and kills him. A Metropolitan London detective (Alfred Marks) and his unit, investigate the deaths of several young women in the city. The women, picked up at nightclubs by Keith (Michael Gothard), have apparently been killed by the same individual, and some of the bodies have been drained of blood. The centerpiece of the movie is a near 15 min. long police car-chase/foot-chase sequence through suburban London. Vincent Price plays a doctor whose clinic specializes in limb and organ transplantation. Christopher Lee plays the head of Britain's -unnamed- intelligence services. Peter Cushing -third-billed- plays an unidentified official in the Eastern European country; a very brief cameo role. The three plot lines converge in a chilling - and unexpected - climax.

But some people want to know how long it takes to speak good English. There are plenty of people in the UK for whom even basic English is a problem. According to a census , 726,000 people in England and Wales said they could not speak English well, and another 138,000 said they did not speak it at all. Ling, 40, who arrived five years ago from China, found it difficult to learn English.\\"When I came here, I was pregnant and so I was at home for the next three years. It took me longer to learn as I was very busy with the children.\\"Eventually she was able to begin taking classes and now speaks good conversational English. But even with classes, it can be a long process to pick up the language. Age is the most important factor in language acquisition, says Mila Vulchanova, professor of linguistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\\"There is a sensitive period in language learning, which is biologically determined. So the younger the immigrant, the better. Since this decline is only gradual, teenagers are at an advantage over adults,\\"she says. There are a number of systems for grading English. The government expects immigrants to reach\\"ESOL Entry 3\\"or\\"B1 level\\", also called\\"Intermediate 1\\"in Scotland, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent to being able to hold a confident conversation and, although the government does not have a target figure, it might take 360 hours of study to achieve. George Osborne said in June following the spending review that welfare claimants who don't speak English will have their benefits cut if they fail to attend language courses. Huan Japes, deputy chief executive of English UK, a trade body for language colleges, says a rule of thumb is 360 hours, 120 hours for each of three stages, to get to the standard the government expects benefit claimants to reach.

Johnny, meanwhile, turned to the remaining group of adventurers, composed of Lisa, Tim, and Oliver. They were a diverse group, consisting of a seasoned mountaineer, a capable geologist, and a gifted naturalist, all united by their burning desire to conquer the elusive Goth Mountain. As twilight approached, Johnny gathered the group around and began to discuss the plan for the night. He emphasized the importance of keeping their wits about them and being aware of the dangers of climbing the perilous Goth Mountain in the dark. This mysterious peak was notorious for its unpredictable weather and treacherous terrain, with legends of strange creatures lurking in the shadows. The four adventurers began their ascent, their headlamps piercing through the darkness. They knew they were facing not just physical challenges, but also the feeling of unease that came with traversing the enigmatic mountain. As they climbed, Oliver, the geologist, shared his knowledge about the intriguing geological formations they encountered. Lisa, the self-assured mountaineer, had traveled far and wide, her experience evident in the way she tackled each new challenge with ease and confidence. Tim, the nature-savvy naturalist, assisted Johnny in identifying key flora and fauna on their route that might either be beneficial or pose threats to the climb. Despite his companions' reassuring presence, Johnny couldn't help but feel a heavy burden on his shoulders, knowing that Two Bears, his trusted friend and mentor, had entrusted the safety of the group to him and had stayed behind. Nevertheless, he pushed forward, determined to honor Two Bears’ faith in him. As their ascent progressed, the group was confronted with relentless gusts of wind and biting cold, adding more obstacles on their path. They witnessed breathtaking panoramas of twinkling stars above and the vast expanse of the mountain range stretching beneath them, even as they weathered the elements. While the climb was daunting, the group became ever more reliant on each other, with their chemistry and camaraderie carrying them from one challenge to the next. They laughed, shared stories, and navigated life-threatening situations in an effort to keep their morale up as Goth Mountain yielded its secrets to them. Finally, the first rays of sunlight began to crack the horizon, bathing the adventurers in a golden glow. They looked around, exhausted but elated, as the summit of Goth Mountain lay just within reach. They knew their journey was far from over; yet, they drew hope and inspiration from their journey so far. With renewed determination, they pushed forward, ready to face the final stretch. They knew that, soon, Two Bears would join them in conquering the mystery that was Goth Mountain, and that their collective triumph would forever bond them as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Now, I have a new situation: David is an environmental scientist.

Solvent molecules from the solution are pushed into the pure solvent. Q: Applying a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of a solution will do what? Choices: - ultrafiltration - osmosis - normal osmosis - reverse osmosis A: Answer:","completion":"- reverse osmosis Explanation: Based on the given paragraph, it is implied that when a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure is applied to a solution, the process of reverse osmosis takes place. In general, osmosis is a process in which solvent molecules move across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration to establish equilibrium. This passive process happens naturally and requires no external energy. However, when an external pressure greater than the natural osmotic pressure is applied to the side of the solution with a higher solute concentration, the natural flow of solvent molecules is reversed. This process is known as reverse osmosis. In reverse osmosis, solvent molecules are pushed from the solution (more concentrated area) back into the pure solvent (less concentrated area) against the natural osmotic gradient. This is in contrast to normal osmosis or ultrafiltration where the solvent flows from a less concentrated to a more concentrated area. Reverse osmosis is effectively used in various applications, such as in water purification processes to remove ions, unwanted molecules, and larger particles from drinking water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: suppose having a weak immune system happens, how will it affect magma stays cool inside of a volcano after a winter storm. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"No effect. A weak immune system is related to an individual's health and their ability to fight off infections and diseases. This factor has no direct impact on the geological processes occurring inside a volcano, such as the cooling of magma. The cooling of magma inside a volcano depends on various factors, like the composition of magma, the surrounding temperature, pressure, and the rate of magma flow, but it is not influenced by a person's immune system or health conditions. Similarly, a winter storm will primarily affect the external conditions around the volcano, such as air temperature and precipitation, but it would have minimal to no effect on the cooling and solidification of magma within the volcano itself. The internal processes that govern magma cooling are largely driven by heat conduction, heat loss through radiation, and convective cooling processes. In conclusion, a weak immune system and winter storms do not have any direct impact on the cooling of magma inside a volcano. The second effect mentioned, which is \\"the volcano's pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano,\\" will also remain unaffected by these factors, as the pressure build-up and eruption dynamics are largely driven by the movement and interaction of molten rock, gases, and other materials deep within the Earth's crust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not white?","completion":"Title: Understanding Global Demographics: The Percentage of Non-White Populations Introduction The concept of race and ethnicity varies widely and changes over time, making it a complex subject matter to discuss. With an increasingly multicultural world and the rapid pace of globalization, it is essential to understand the demographic makeup of the global population. One particular aspect of interest is the percentage of people who are not considered 'white.' For the purpose of this article, 'white' refers to people of European descent, while 'non-white' refers to individuals of African, Asian, indigenous, mixed, and other non-European descent. In the following sections, we will examine relevant data on the non-white population, explore regional disparities, and discuss the growing diversity within various countries. Global Statistics According to the United Nations World Population Prospect, the global population currently stands at approximately 7.9 billion, with a broad range of ethnic and racial backgrounds. To understand the percentage of non-white individuals, we must first analyze the global distribution of diverse racial and ethnic populations. Europe – The continent with the highest concentration of white individuals, Europe accounts for approximately 747 million people, or about 9.4% of the global population. Asia – Home to approximately 4.7 billion people, Asia has a diverse population consisting mostly of Asian descent individuals, with a minority of other racial and ethnic groups. Africa – Around 1.4 billion people reside in Africa, with the majority belonging to various indigenous African ethnic groups. North America – With approximately 372 million people, North America is predominantly white but has significant non-white populations, such as African Americans, Native Americans, and other racial/ethnic minorities. South America – Home to around 436 million individuals, South America has sizable populations of both European and indigenous heritages, along with other racial and ethnic groups. Oceania – This region encompasses about 43 million people, composed largely of indigenous populations, such as Pacific Islanders and Aboriginal Australians, alongside European and Asian communities. Percentage of Non-White Populations Considering the global population distribution mentioned above, approximately 6.4 billion individuals or 81% are non-white individuals. This percentage has been increasing in recent decades due to increasing non-white birth rates, migration patterns, and interactions of people from different backgrounds. Regional Disparities and Diversity within Countries While the global percentage provides an overall understanding of non-white populations, regional disparities and the varying degree of diversity within countries merit further attention. Many urban areas across the globe have become increasingly diverse, with people of different races and ethnicities settling in the same locations, often due to economic opportunities, education, and cultural exchanges. In countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, multiracial and multiethnic populations are growing at a rapid pace, with trends showing that larger percentages of non-white individuals reside within these societies. Conclusion Understanding the percentage of non-white populations globally provides an essential foundation for addressing inequalities and building a more inclusive society. With approximately 81% of the global population being non-white, it is evident that the world consists of a rich tapestry of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. As societies continue to become more diverse, it is paramount that individuals, communities, and governments promote equality and inclusivity to shape a better future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Last Boy Scout is a 1991 American action comedy film directed by Tony Scott, starring Bruce Willis, Damon Wayans, Chelsea Field, Noble Willingham, Taylor Negron and Danielle Harris. The film was released in the United States on December 13, 1991. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Last Boy scout only released in the united states.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not accurate to conclude that \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" was only released in the United States. While the film was indeed released in the United States on December 13, 1991, there is no information to suggest that this was its sole release. To draw a more comprehensive conclusion, it is essential to consider additional factors and information beyond just the US release date. For instance: 1. International releases: Movies are generally released in other countries over time. It would be helpful to explore the international release dates of The Last Boy Scout to determine if it was only released in the United States or other countries as well. 2. Director and cast background: The director, Tony Scott, was British, making it unlikely that the film would only be released in the United States. Furthermore, the cast members are also widely known, further supporting the notion that the film most likely had a broader release beyond the United States. 3. Distribution company: The film was produced by major film production companies, including Warner Bros., Silver Pictures, and Geffen Pictures. These companies typically organize wide distribution and release for their movies in several countries worldwide to maximize revenue. Therefore, it would be uncommon for a film to be exclusively released in one country. 4. Worldwide Box Office: The Last Boy Scout grossed approximately 59.5 million in the United States and Canada, while its worldwide earnings totaled around 114.5 million. This figure demonstrates that the film was successful not only in the United States but also in other countries, confirming that it saw release beyond the US. 5. Subsequent releases and formats: Films are often made available in various formats and platforms following their theatrical release, such as DVDs, Blu-Rays, streaming services, or television broadcast. It is likely that The Last Boy Scout was also released in such formats, further expanding its accessibility for audiences worldwide. In conclusion, based on the factors mentioned above, it would be incorrect to conclude that The Last Boy Scout was only released in the United States. Although the film did release in the United States on December 13, 1991, multiple factors indicate that the film likely received a broader release at various times and platforms, catering to a global audience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: country, park, town, countryside, near Why is \\"town\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons and justifications: 1. Availability and accessibility: A town typically has various amenities available for its residents, including recreational facilities like a soccer field. It is reasonable to assume that a soccer field might be located in a town since towns are designed to cater to the needs of their citizens. 2. Community gathering: A town often serves as a gathering place for the community. Sports fields, including soccer fields, may be located in towns to provide residents with a common space to gather, socialize, and participate in recreational activities. 3. Population density: Towns typically have a higher population density compared to rural areas such as the countryside. This means that there are more people concentrated in a smaller area, leading to an increased demand for recreational facilities like a soccer field. 4. Maintenance and management: A town usually has a local government or administration responsible for ensuring public spaces, including sports facilities, are well maintained and managed. This makes it more likely for a soccer field to be located in a town, as it would receive proper care and supervision. 5. Comparing the other options: a.

The UK government had estimated that Atos and Capita would earn £512m for Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) assessments between 2013 and 2017. But analysis by the Press Association suggests they will actually get £700m. Labour said the deals were \\"rewarding failure\\", but the government said effective assessments were vital. PIPs are payments for people aged between 16 and 64 who have ill health or a disability, and since 2013 have been gradually replacing the Disability Living Allowance. Money is allocated according to a points system and a person's eligibility is kept under regular review. Atos and Capita assess PIPs in England, Scotland and Wales, with tests devolved in Northern Ireland. Payments averaged £19m a month in the past two years, according to monthly spending data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). If kept at current levels, this could land the DWP with a total bill of more than £700m. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, made a U-turn on plans to cut PIPs payments when in office in 2016, said officials had underestimated the number of claimants and therefore the cost of the contracts. \\"I think that is probably a fair criticism that could be levelled at the DWP,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"It hasn't been very good at getting its forecasts right.\\" He added that there had been \\"operational problems\\" with the way the contracts were carried out. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said: \\"It is beyond belief that this Tory government is rewarding failure. \\"The PIP process is in disarray and these private companies are receiving huge payouts in a time of extreme austerity.

Step 2: Sleepwalking is not related directly to the sensation of falling in a dream and is thus not a suitable option.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you're playing a new opponent, whether it's at a competition or during a friendly game at a family outing, you should assess your opponent's game even while you're warming up. You should look for a few main things: if your opponent is more of an aggressive or defensive player, if his forehand or backhand is his dominant shot, and any weaknesses, such as slow footwork or weak drop shot returns, that you can exploit. Don't hit all of your shots to the same location of the court of your opponent will be able to predict your next move every time. Instead, mix things up by hitting a drop shot followed by a shot to the baseline, or by moving your opponent from the right to the left side of the court. Moving from the front to the back of the court is particularly tricky unless your opponent has very nimble feet. Many players are weaker on the backhand side, so try shooting toward your opponent's backhand and see if this makes your opponent return less shots. If so, continue to exploit your opponent's backhand. Your backhand is the left side for right-handed players and the right side for left-handed players. When you're up at the net, simply hit the shuttle short, just barely over to your opponent's side. This will make your opponent run and will catch him off guard. This is a great technique if your opponent is positioned near the back line. If your opponent knows that you are going to do a short shot, you need to flick the shuttle over the opponent or to another side and if you didn't do this, your opponent will fly the shuttle near the back line. If your opponent hits the shuttle straight at you, hit the shuttle in a different direction instead of hitting it right back at your opponent, where he will expect it to go. This will work especially well if the shuttle has generated a lot of momentum. If you're quick on your feet, you can change the direction of the shuttle and not give your opponent enough time to react to a fast-moving shuttle. If you have mastered the drop shot, then use it to make your opponent run all the way to the front of the court. Then return the next shot all the way to the back of the court. Not only will this force your opponent to be quick on his feet, but it will also catch him off guard. This is also a great way to tire your opponent. To do a drop shot, hit the shuttle lightly so it just crosses the net. If you like staying near the net, serve short, hit drop shots, and do whatever you can to make sure that your opponent can't hit the shuttle to the back line. If you're more comfortable at the back line, then serve long and hit speedy long shots so your opponent doesn't have a chance to move you toward the net. Make the opponent lose all control as you play your style of game and maximize your strengths.","completion":"The article provides strategies for assessing an opponent's badminton game, exploiting weaknesses, and utilizing various shots and court positions to gain an advantage, ultimately enabling players to control the match and maximize their strengths."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The teenager wants to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, which indicates that he is hoping to show her that he is responsible, organized, and cares about maintaining a clean and tidy living space. These qualities are more likely to make a positive impression on his girlfriend than the other options, which are generally negative or unrelated to the task at hand. A.

Chores - Although doing chores showcases responsibility and a willingness to contribute to household duties, it is the ultimate result – cleanliness – that is likely to impress the girl more than the simple act of completing chores. C. Allergies - This option is rather unrelated to impressing someone and is more likely to cause discomfort or distress than create a positive impression. D. Pain and suffering - This option also has no direct correlation to impressing someone and, like boredom, it is more likely to create negative feelings than inspire admiration or appreciation. E. Cleanliness - A clean and well-maintained living space not only demonstrates responsibility and organizational skills but also showcases thoughtfulness and care for one's surroundings.

(CNN) -- \\"The Walking Dead\\" left us hanging with its midseason finale last year, so we knew to expect surprises when the AMC show returned Sunday. And oh, were there surprises. We talked with Danai Gurira -- aka Michonne -- ahead of Sunday's premiere, and she said to watch for a different tone during the remainder of season four as the focus shifted to the journey of individual characters. She conveniently left out that her character's backstory would be explored in a dream sequence, a scene that easily became one of Sunday's highlights. There was much-needed insight into Michonne, including an apparent explanation on why she became so emotional when holding baby Judith -- she had had a son before (not to mention a lover). He was angry with his father,","completion":"who had seemingly given up on their survival in the apocalyptic world. The tension between Michonne's lover, Mike, and his father had been building for some time, creating a rift in their already strained relationship. This all came to a head in Sunday's episode, where the truth of their family's past was finally laid bare for viewers to see. In the dream sequence, we learn that Michonne was once a loving and devoted mother, fiercely protective of her young son, Andre. However, the unforgiving circumstances of the zombie apocalypse had begun to take its toll on the family. Mike had become resentful towards his father, who appeared to have lost hope and purpose, seemingly abandoning the fight for survival. This led to heated arguments and further rifts within their small family unit. The hauntingly vivid dream sequence transported Michonne back to a time when life was simpler, yet tinged with despair. As she relives these heart-wrenching memories, we witness the downward spiral that ultimately led her to become the hardened survivor we've come to know and respect. The culmination of this flashback was a chilling scene depicting the heart-wrenching moment Michonne lost everything: her son, her lover, and her sense of normalcy. This revelation, compounded by her inability to save everyone, only cements Michonne's deep-rooted guilt and sorrow for the life and family she once had. But even with these tragic memories, the episode also showed how Michonne's past fortified her resolve to stay alive and help the people she has come to care about in the present. As the story progressed, viewers witnessed Michonne's determination and compassion grow, allowing her to form meaningful bonds with those around her, particularly Rick and Carl. In the end, the dream sequence succeeded in deepening Michonne's character development, making her an even more compelling and relatable character to the audience. The insight into her past was crucial in understanding her actions and motivations throughout the series, and emphasized the strength of her character in overcoming the trauma of losing everything that mattered to her. Moving forward, fans of \\"The Walking Dead\\" are likely to see a more emotionally open Michonne, as she continues to grapple with both her past and the relentless battle for survival.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said. Question: \\"How old was Joan Fontaine when she moved to Saratoga?\\" Response: \\"Three\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Joan Fontaine moved to Saratoga, California, with her mother in 1919, when she was three years old (born in 1916)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Up to 1990, English, German and Afrikaans were official languages. Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as \\"a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation.\\" Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and \\"English language\\" is a compulsory subject. As in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low. Question: How many Namibian's speak English?","completion":"As mentioned in the article, only about 3% of the Namibian population speaks English as a home language. Since the implementation of English as the sole official language in the country, its usage has become more widespread in the civil service, education, and broadcasting system.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are three audience levels you need to concern yourself with here: The interviewer: Usually, a specific journalist will be assigned to your interview. Make sure you know who will be conducting the interview and read his or her past pieces to find out what that interviewer's slant or focus generally is. The media outlet: The tone of an interview usually varies depending on the medium used to deliver it. A blog is one of the most casual, followed by phone interviews, newspaper interviews, and radio interviews. Professional journal interviews and broadcast television interviews tend to be the most formal. The primary audience: The company the reporter works for will have a specific audience. A local news or radio station will ask questions that will concern local viewers, while a national station will ask questions that pertain to a wider audience. A specialized source, like a blog or journal, will focus on issues that affect their readership. If the interview is scheduled in advance, gather all possible information about it as you set up the time and date. Find out what material the interviewer plans on asking about as well as the expected length of the interview. Depending on the content of the interview, the journalist may even be willing to provide you with a list of questions he or she plans to ask. The list may not be comprehensive, but it could at least give you a place to start. If there is information you cannot disclose about a given topic, make sure the reporter knows this ahead of time. He or she may still try to ask about it anyway, but if you firmly explain that you will not answer those questions before the interview, the reporter is less likely to push you for an answer. Since press interviews can be about nearly any topic, it is impossible to generalize about the questions you will be asked during the interview. If the reporter does not provide you with a list in advance, prepare yourself by noting the most important aspects of whatever the subject matter is. Anticipate what others might be curious about and prepare your answers based on that. Conducting a mock interview is often a good way to calm your anxieties about the real interview. Set aside time in advance for a test run. Ask a trusted associate to practice interviewing with you. Have the associate ask questions you have been informed about or ones that you anticipate and deliver your answers as though you were conducting the actual interview. You can wear anything you want during a phone or email interview, of course, but if you are meeting with the reporter in person, you should wear clean clothes that are suited to your position. This is true regardless of whether you will appear in photographs or video.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which year was there a break in the monsoon regime? Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] The answer is:","completion":"2019 was the year when there was a break in the monsoon regime. The subtropical ridge, which influences monsoon conditions, was weaker in 2019 compared to 2018. This caused the subtropical ridge to remain farther south than normal, leading to a drier atmosphere across the Desert Southwest and a break in the monsoon regime. In contrast, 2018 experienced a very wet year in the Four Corners area due to the stronger subtropical ridge that extended monsoon moisture and thunderstorms further north."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The shadow chancellor said he always asked for a written record, even if it was just for £10 to cut a hedge, because it was the \\"right thing to do\\". Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said this was \\"absurd\\" and showed Labour did not understand business. He added he did not think anyone in the country would do such a thing. On Sunday Mr Balls told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics that people should ask for a record of paying somebody, even if it was for small jobs like cutting a hedge, because they have a \\"legal obligation\\" to pay tax. But Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast Mr Balls's comments demonstrated \\"Labour's complete lack of understanding of how business works and how people get by\\". Analysis, by personal finance correspondent Ian Pollock Cash payments are not dirty. In case you had gained the opposite impression, paying a self-employed person in cash for doing a job around your house or garden is completely legal. Furthermore there is no legal obligation on you to keep a record of the payment, or to account for it to anyone at all. It is your money and you can do what you like with it. All UK tax obligations lie with the self-employed person you are paying. As a matter of fact, a tradesman is not obliged to even offer you a receipt. But they should keep proper records so they can pay the right income tax and pay VAT too, if applicable. Of course, everyone knows that some tradesmen prefer cash because it is hard to trace. That makes it easier for them to dodge their own tax obligations, if they so choose. But so long as you have not colluded with them, there is no onus on you to do anything about it. You aren't even obliged to grass them up, though HMRC would like you to do so. He added: \\"Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.\\" And Mr Balls's colleague, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, also said he did not think most people would keep a receipt for such things. He told BBC Breakfast: \\"I don't think everybody will keep a receipt..I don't necessarily keep a receipt for everything I pay for though it's a good idea to keep a record.\\" The shadow chancellor's comments were made as Labour and the Tories continue to row over alleged tax dodging in light of the HSBC tax scandal. Pressed on the issue Mr Balls said: \\"It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered. \\"They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.\\" Mr Balls had been \\"extremely careful\\" about observing such rules ever since entering politics, he explained. Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone, appearing on the same programme on Sunday, accused him of implying that all small businesses were trying to dodge taxes. \\"There are so many cash businesses,\\" Mr Bone said. \\"If you go into a cafe for a cup of tea you would not expect a receipt for it. If you were running a fish and chip shop you do not always give receipts. \\"It shows a complete lack of understanding of business. Is he trying to imply that if you are a small business that deals in cash, you are trying to dodge tax? \\"I think it shows how completely out of touch he is with small business. There is an implication that everybody is out to fiddle their taxes. It is just wrong.\\" In recent weeks, Mr Balls has been asked to answer accusations that the Labour Party is anti-business, but has insisted it has a track record of supporting an \\"open, dynamic, wealth-creating, entrepreneurial economy\\".

In fact sharks come in all shapes, sizes and even colors! Follow me please; I'd like to show you a very special small shark commonly known as horn sharks, only found in the coastal waters of north-west North America. Look at this shark, and you can easily see the horns on it and you will know the reason why it is called the horn shark is that it has the broad, flattened head and two large horn-like spines found behind its eyes and makes it one of the hardiest of all shark species. What makes it unique is that as its enemy attempts to swallow it, the spines on its back will stick into the enemy's mouth and give a good chance for it to get away. The horn shark is brown in color with black spots all over its body. The adults can reach up to a length of 4 feet and weigh up to 10 kg. An interesting fact about the horn shark is that it has five gills . The horn shark is a clumsy swimmer using its flexible pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom of the ocean. The maximum distance that has ever been recorded for a horn shark to have traveled out from its habitat is 10 miles. Today, as so little is known about its population off the Californian coast, they have been listed as being \\"Data Deficient\\" in the World Conservation Union.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

However, this factor does not directly alter the life cycle steps mentioned in the question. Thus, the perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it may affect the number of caterpillars that are available to eat and go through the rest of their life cycle, but it does not directly change the steps outlined for an individual caterpillar's development from larva to butterfly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder?\\" Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Affirmative action programs, initially designed to remediate past discrimination and promote diversity, sometimes lead to unintended consequences that can disincentivize poor white people to work harder. Terry Eastland and Thomas Sowell have identified multiple reasons that contribute to this disincentive, which are explained below: 1. Misallocation of resources: Sowell argues that affirmative action policies tend to primarily benefit the most fortunate among the preferred groups, such as upper and middle-class minorities. This misallocation of resources means that poor white individuals, who may be equally or more deserving of support, do not receive the same opportunities, leading them to feel that their efforts are futile. 2. Incentive reduction for the non-preferred groups: Affirmative action programs can create a perception among non-preferred groups, such as poor white or Asian individuals, that their hard work and achievements may not be rewarded fairly due to preferential treatment for other groups. This perception may decrease their motivation to perform at their best because they may feel disadvantaged in the competition for resources and opportunities. 3. Encouragement of self-identification with preferred groups: Sowell also notes that affirmative action policies can motivate individuals from non-preferred groups to identify themselves as members of preferred groups, in order to take advantage of the benefits associated with them. This can undermine the original intent of the programs, as resources may not reach those genuinely in need of support. 4. Creation of animosity: Affirmative action programs can unintentionally cause resentment and animosity among non-preferred groups, who may perceive themselves as being unfairly treated. This can further disincentivize them from working hard, as they may feel that the system is inherently biased against them. 5. Stigma and self-doubt in minorities: Eastland points out that affirmative action can generate a sense of entitlement or self-doubt in minorities, as they may question whether their achievements are genuinely based on merit or are instead a result of preferential treatment. This can lead to less motivation and drive in these groups to work hard and excel. In summary, while affirmative action programs aim to redress past discrimination and promote diversity, they can sometimes lead to unintended negative consequences that disincentivize poor white people and other non-preferred groups from working harder. Factors such as the misallocation of resources, reduced incentives, self-identification issues, creation of animosity, and stigma in minorities contribute to this disincentive, ultimately resulting in potential losses for both individuals and society as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

In a recent car race at the Spanish Grand Prix, there were two main racers: Felipe Massa driving a shiny red Ferrari, and Kimi Raikkonen with a cool Lotus car. Felipe Massa is just like you at playtime, always trying his best to win, zooming his Ferrari around the track as fast as he can. And just like when you have the edge over your friend in your play races, Felipe also managed to get ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in this real car race.

You know how everyone moves around while the music plays, and when the music stops, everyone tries to find a chair to sit on but there's always one less chair than the number of people playing so someone will be left standing? Well, in racing, like in the game, everyone wants to be the first one, and Felipe Massa was the first one this time, in the final practice. But although Kimi Raikkonen didn't get to the finish line first in this practice run, remember how you don't always win in the games you play either, and that's okay, because there's always next time - and that's exactly what Kimi Raikkonen is thinking too. Even if they didn't win this time, Kimi and his Lotus car are ready to give it another try at the real race.

Question: Where is Lawrence thrown after he is flogged and raped in the movie? Movie title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: In 1935, T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man.

Answer the following question: Why is he feeling the way he 's feeling ?","completion":"There could be a multitude of reasons as to why he is feeling the way he is, including personal insecurities, fear of rejection, or misperceptions. However, it's crucial to understand that any analysis is speculative, and the feelings and thoughts of an individual may vary greatly depending on their unique experiences and personal circumstances. Here, we will explore some possible factors that contribute to his feelings and behavior. 1. Fear of Rejection: Fear of rejection is a common human emotion, and he might be feeling this way as he does not wish to experience the vulnerability that comes with being rejected. This fear can accentuate the desire for approval, making the person go to great lengths in an attempt to gain acceptance from the other person. 2. Personal Insecurities: Personal insecurities can play a significant role in the way someone reacts to situations in which rejection is involved. He may be feeling insecure about himself (e.g., his looks, achievements, or social status), which could make him overly sensitive to rejection, ultimately affecting how he processes and reacts to your response. 3. Misinterpretation: There could be some level of misinterpretation or misunderstanding on his part about your rejection. He might have thought that you were uncertain or just trying to be polite, so he took it upon himself to actively pursue you further, hoping that he could change your mind. 4. Social Expectations: Societal norms and expectations might be influencing his behavior. He might have been conditioned to believe that he should make more attempts or be more persistent when pursuing someone, thinking that persistence would be rewarded in the end. 5. Emotional Connection: If he has a strong emotional connection or attachment to you, he might find it challenging to accept your rejection, perhaps believing that deep down, you share the same feelings for him, thus making it harder for him to move on. 6. Difficulty in Accepting Rejection: Some individuals may find it difficult to accept rejection, particularly if they have not faced much rejection in their life, causing them to cling onto hope that the situation might change or they can win the other person over. 7. Overconfidence: If he has experienced considerable success in the past when pursuing potential partners, his overconfidence might lead him to think that you will eventually change your mind or that your rejection was not genuine. Overconfidence in his abilities may make him push forward despite the initial rejection. In conclusion, there could be various factors driving his feelings and actions in this situation. It is important to remember that each individual, their feelings, and motivations, are unique, and therefore, any analysis is inherently speculative. To gain a better understanding of his emotions, communication and open dialogue may play a vital role in clarifying his feelings and thought processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine...

Thieves got away with 18 mainly Jade Chinese pieces worth about £15m in a raid at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum in 2012. Several people were jailed but the items have never been located. A further 14 men have been convicted for roles in that and other raids. Roger Keverne, who helped value the £15m jade said if it had been taken to China, \\"that's possibly goodbye\\". On 13 April 2012, thieves broke in through the rear of the museum, smashed display cabinets and made off with artefacts described as being of \\"incalculable cultural significance\\". Five months later three men were jailed and a boy of 16 was given a detention order. More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire The stolen items, believed to be worth up to £15m, could be worth tens of millions more on the \\"booming\\" Chinese auction market, police said. Despite appeals by the museum and police, and a \\"substantial\\" reward, the jade appears to have been spirited away. Mr Keverne, a London-based dealer who specialises in Chinese ceramics and works of art, was contacted by the Fitzwilliam Museum following the theft. The Fitzwilliam raiders were \\"very fortunate... that they were able to breach the security,\\" he said. Security would \\"always be a problem\\" for museums as \\"the works of art and the treasures they hold have to be to a certain extent accessible to the public\\". Asked whether the Fitzwilliam Museum was likely to get its stolen artefacts back, he said: \\"It looks like they may not. \\"These things do have a habit of turning up eventually - well, they get put back to the market, things get recycled, they get passed on. \\"They move up the chain until they're probably in the hands of someone who doesn't realise they have been stolen.\\" On Monday, 14 men were convicted over their roles in stealing artefacts from the Fitzwilliam and other museums and an auction house. On the open market the haul could be worth up to £57m, investigators said. One of them, Donald Chi Chong Wong, 56, of London, was described in court as a \\"fence\\" who made frequent trips to Hong Kong. A number of these took place around the time of the Fitzwilliam heist and by the summer of 2012 Wong was under police surveillance, having met several times with other members of the gang. It is not known whether he managed to transport any of the museum's artefacts overseas, but Mr Keverne said: \\"If they've gone to mainland China - that's possibly goodbye.\\" The Fitzwilliam Museum declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.

The next day, Woody finds Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the toys from the showâJessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Peteâare excited about going, Woody intents to return home since he is still one of Andy's toys. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it, meaning they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection. When his arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled by someone mysteriously turning on Al's television set. The next morning, a cleaner repairs his arm, and Woody learns that Jessie once belong to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away.

Ministers discussed how to strengthen EU foreign policy in times of economic crisis. At the informal ministerial meeting held at the prestigious Bella Centre in Copenhagen, significant discussions took place revolving around the pressing issue of strengthening European Union (EU) foreign policy during a time of economic crisis. The meeting occurred over a span of two days, Friday and Saturday, and saw the participation of several ministers. The common consensus was that the European Union needed to focus on enhancing cooperation and collaboration across the member states to improve its overall foreign policy while simultaneously addressing the economic challenges. In light of this, several key strategies were highlighted during this meeting that could potentially lead to successful outcomes in the face of the crisis. One of the primary areas of concern was improving communication and fostering transparency across member states, with an emphasis on understanding the unique challenges faced by each country. By doing this, the EU can work together to find common ground and share resources, knowledge, and expertise more effectively. Additionally, the meeting stressed the importance of maintaining strong diplomatic relations with countries outside of the EU to navigate the complexities of the global economic landscape. This approach would include engaging in meaningful dialogue, fostering trade agreements, and participating in international forums to maintain the influence and strength of the European Union globally. Another critical aspect discussed was the need for the EU to prioritize investment in research and development, particularly in fields such as renewable energy, digital technology, infrastructure, and healthcare. The ministers agreed that creating a solid foundation in these industries would enhance the region's competitive edge in the global market while also promoting job growth and economic development. The ministers in attendance also addressed the necessity of monitoring and controlling the potential risks associated with financial institutions and ensuring that appropriate regulations are in place to mitigate negative economic impacts. They proposed that the EU should strengthen supervision and enforcement mechanisms to maintain stability in the financial markets and avoid future economic downturns. Lastly, the meeting underlined the vital role of collaboration in addressing regional and global challenges, such as climate change, migration, and security threats. The ministers collectively agreed that working together in a unified manner would ultimately lead to the fortification of the EU's foreign policy and better positioning in the face of economic crises. In conclusion, the informal ministerial meeting at Bella Centre in Copenhagen offered insights and practical solutions to bolster the European Union's foreign policy during these economically challenging times. By focusing on enhanced collaboration across member states, maintaining strong diplomatic relations with countries outside the EU, investing in research and development, regulating financial institutions, and addressing global challenges collectively, the EU can emerge from the crisis in a stronger and more resilient position."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here Here is a hypothesis: So long as drug testing isn't random, it's completely fair. Here are the options: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, we can analyze the relationship between them and evaluate whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis and assess them in context. Premise: According to the premise, an employer makes the drug testing schedule clear to the employees at the time of their hiring process. The employees are informed that the test will happen the next day and that they will continue to be tested every three months while working for the organization. Essentially, the premise suggests that drug testing is conducted on a predetermined and consistent schedule, rather than random testing, with employees being fully aware of it. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that if drug testing is not random and is conducted according to a clear schedule, it can be deemed completely fair. Now, let us examine and relate the premise and hypothesis. Given the premise, we know that the employees are informed about the drug testing schedule from the beginning. By doing so, the employer maintains transparency and allows employees to anticipate the drug tests, which may encourage them to comply with regulations and avoid substance abuse. The hypothesis assumes that non-random drug testing that follows a consistent and transparent schedule might be considered fair, as employees are aware of the process and understand the expectations placed upon them. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we can infer that the hypothesis is likely to be true. If the premise holds where drug testing is conducted according to a predefined schedule and employees are made aware of it, then it stands that such a system could be perceived as fair. Thus, we can choose option (1) as the answer, which states \\"yes.\\" However, it is important to note that fairness could be a subjective opinion, and some individuals may disagree."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Box Hill Senior Secondary College has no feeders - schools , new students are welcomed from all over Melbourne , but are only selected after the interview .","completion":"Yes, both sentences convey the same overall meaning, which is about how Box Hill Senior Secondary College (the subject) has a unique admission process. However, there are slight differences in nuance between the two sentences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"Box Hill Senior Secondary College has no feeders - schools, new students are selected from all over Melbourne, but only welcomed after the interview.\\" This sentence emphasizes the selection of students first, and then the process through which they are welcomed into the College. The focus here is more on how the student body is formed by selecting students from all over Melbourne, without a specific feeder school system. The welcoming process is mentioned last, suggesting that the interview is an important procedure before students are officially part of the college community. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Box Hill Senior Secondary College has no feeders - schools, new students are welcomed from all over Melbourne, but are only selected after the interview.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the welcoming nature of the College first, and then the selection process that takes place after the interview. Although the overall meaning remains the same, the order of emphasis is changed, with the students being \\"welcomed\\" first, before being \\"selected\\" through the interview. In conclusion, both sentences essentially communicate the same idea: Box Hill Senior Secondary College has a unique admission process that does not rely on feeder schools, admits students from all over Melbourne, and requires an interview. The difference lies mainly in the order of emphasis and the description of the selection process. Despite these minor nuances, the main takeaway from both sentences is that the College's admission process is independent of a feeder school system and involves a comprehensive interview for students from all over Melbourne."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The judges for the competition include Scottish novelist Margot Livesey. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Greensboro (formerly Greensborough) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina.

Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - Leon Eugene Stover (April 9, 1929 November 25, 2006) was an anthropologist, a Sinologist, and a science fiction fan, who wrote both fiction and nonfiction.

Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - Charles I (19 November 1600 30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. - Laren Stover ( b.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east.

Article: Scores on a national test released on November 1 show that students in the U.S.A. have improved in math over the last two years, but mostly stayed the same in reading. This year, 422,000 fourth graders and 343,000 eighth graders took the exams between January and March. Students were asked to read grade-appropriate materials and answer questions for the reading test. For the math test, students answered questions about geometry, algebra, number properties, measurement and other topics. The U.S Department of Education released the scores in a report called The Nation's Report Card (NAEP). This year, students earned the highest scores ever recorded on the math exam, which has been given since 1990.Fourth graders scored an average of 241.That is a one-point increase from 2009and a 28-point increase from 1990. Eighth graders made similar progress. Then average score this year was 284,up one point from 2009 and 21 points from 1990. In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day.

[2]. positive.).","completion":"Title: The Radiant Sunrise [1. Positive] The Radiant Sunrise is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air in the saturated world of cinema. It goes beyond the mundane storytelling and transcends into a realm of captivating visuals, awe-inspiring performances, and a unique narrative that is sure to leave the audience with profound emotions and reflections on life. The film, directed by the visionary filmmaker Alex Sondheim, is a testament to the creative potential of cinema as an art form, refusing to conform to the status quo and daring to challenge the limits of storytelling through the lens of human experience. Set against the backdrop of a picturesque small village by the ocean, the movie follows the life of its protagonist, Emma, played by the incredibly talented and versatile Isabella Anderson. Emma's journey from a reserved and introverted young woman to a strong-willed and passionate leader that brings a transformative change to her village, her family, and her own life, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. The nuanced portrayal of Emma's character by Isabella reflects the struggles and triumphs of an individual who has the courage to overcome societal barriers and dream big. The film’s supporting cast is equally remarkable, bringing an array of interesting characters to life. From the enigmatic and endearing paternal figure of George, played by veteran actor John Simmons, to the dynamic and daring character of Luna, played by the radiant newcomer Michelle Lee, the ensemble display commitment and dedication, which elevates the whole production. Visually, The Radiant Sunrise is a treat for the eyes – every frame being a testament to Sondheim's mastery over the craft. The stunning camerawork by the esteemed director of photography, Laura Crane, captures the true essence of the village, its people, and its authentic lifestyle, making the audience feel an instant connection with the film’s characters and setting. The picturesque landscapes are blended seamlessly with the narrative to create an atmosphere that draws you deeper into the story. The music score composed by the prodigious talent, Oscar Trevino, transforms the emotions on screen into an auditory experience that is truly moving. From the tranquil tunes that accompany Emma's introspective moments to the powerful orchestral pieces that propel the narrative forward during critical junctures, the score elevates the impact of the film on a whole new level. However, the true genius of The Radiant Sunrise lies in its storytelling. Sondheim's unique ability to weave a narrative that simultaneously explores themes of self-discovery, compassion, love, and human resilience sends a powerful and uplifting message to all who watch it. The dialogue is thought-provoking, the character arcs are compelling, and the emotions portrayed are genuine and evocative. In conclusion, The Radiant Sunrise is a cinematic gem that stands out in today's world of formulaic storytelling. It artfully showcases the power of cinema as a medium to explore the depths of human experiences and stirs the soul with its breathtaking visuals, phenomenal performances, and a powerful narrative. This film is a testament to Sondheim's genius and a reminder that cinema can and should be innovative, thought-provoking, and undeniably beautiful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Katie Bowman claims she is being harrased by police after splitting from her PC boyfriend. A forensic science graduate says her life was made a misery after she was allegedly harassed by police following a split from her PC boyfriend. Katie Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, claims police interest in her – which saw her stopped 70 times for suspected offences ranging from drink-driving to assault – meant she could ‘barely leave the house’. The 24-year-old alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from Alexander Ash. Miss Bowman says that despite never. securing a conviction against her, the force has kept damaging. intelligence reports on her which are stopping her getting a job. She. has won the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve,. who said he was ‘seriously concerned’ by damning comments held on file. about her, which he said bordered on ‘trivial’. Miss. Bowman claims the harassment started in earnest in 2007 when she was 18. and PC Ash, also based in High Wycombe, was disciplined by his force. for making inappropriate contact with her after their split. PC. Ash, who denies ever having been in a relationship with Miss Bowman,. said this disciplinary action instead related to drunken behaviour on a. night out with friends. Papers. obtained by Miss Bowman’s family suggest that more than ten of the 40. intelligence reports on her were filed by a friend and colleague of PC. Ash. Following. court action by her family, Thames Valley Police launched a review last. year and earlier this year and removed 20 of the reports. However,. the Bowmans have vowed to take legal action to clear her name fully. They also hope to bring the officers they claim are involved to justice. and to seek compensation. Miss. Bowman, now engaged and expecting her first child, says she was. breathtested 70 times – 54 in one year from September 2007. Each time. the result was negative. She. was stopped on suspicion of possessing drugs and given a caution for an. alleged assault – later rescinded after a professional standards. investigation. Her car was seized eight times, and she was given. disorder penalty notices. Miss Bowman, 24, alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from PC Alexander Ash (file picture) Her. father Brian Bowman, from Hertfordshire, said: ‘Katie could barely. leave the house without being stopped. Her life was made an utter misery. by a gang – but a gang in police uniform.’ Miss. Bowman says that, with the support of Mr Grieve, she has repeatedly. complained to the force. She has successfully challenged the more. serious allegations which would have led to a criminal record. Mr. Grieve has written to Thames Valley Chief Constable Sara Thornton. twice, branding the reports kept on Miss Bowman as ‘entirely lacking in. substance’. He told the Mail: ‘I am very concerned, her allegation is of. a serious nature.’ One. intelligence report alleges a set of blue LED decorative lights placed. pointing into the footwell of her car amounted to unlawfully displaying. emergency blue lights. Despite. never leading to an arrest, the claims showed up in CRB checks and cost. Miss Bowman her job as an ambulance call handler in 2007 and saw her. sacked from another job as a student paramedic three years later. It. also stopped her becoming a special constable in 2011. In. his letter to the chief constable, Mr Grieve said she ‘is a person of. good character... adversely affected by the numerous derogatory comments. made about her by police’. Having met Miss Bowman twice, he found it ‘difficult’ to match up the image of her as ‘the wayward teenager’ portrayed in police reports. He also raised concerns that the possible motive for the police’s conduct is that she was being punished for getting PC Ash in trouble. Last night PC Ash, 31, who married recently, said: ‘I met her on a night out about six years ago and again when she came for an open day for prospective employees who want to join the force.’ The roads policing officer added: ‘I think she was upset because I wouldn’t go out with her and made several allegations about me. I have absolutely no idea why she would say we were an item.’ Thames Valley Police said: ‘The need to retain the intelligence reports relating to Ms Bowman was reviewed in 2012 (following which a number were removed) and in 2013 following further requests made on her behalf. ‘Thames Valley Police will not be commenting on the details of the reports, but we seek to comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act and the national standards for the management of police information.’ The force said it had investigated a complaint from Miss Bowman in 2009 that ‘officers from High Wycombe have harassed her by causing her to be stopped, arrested, her vehicle seized and maliciously prosecuted’. It added: ‘The complaint was found to be unsubstantiated and Miss Bowman’s appeal to the IPCC was not upheld.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Movie title: Alien Trespass Context: The story begins in 1957 in the star-filled skies above California's Mojave Desert. It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special anniversary dinner with steaks for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana while observing the annual meteor shower of the Perseids. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small local diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited to see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. Suddenly \\"something shoots overhead and crashes\\" in the nearby mountains. Assuming it is a fallen meteorite, Ted wants to investigate in person. He reaches the supposed meteorite, which turns out to be an alien spaceship. Then his body is usurped by Urp, a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien. Urp has discovered that the other passenger of his ship, the one-eyed monster known as Ghota has escaped. He needs to retrieve it and uses a human body to blend in with the locals.[2] The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. Its unquenchable appetite could mean the end of life on Earth.[2] Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial. He enlists the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing to believe and trust in his mission. The local police - including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern - are confirmed skeptics and offer little help. Together, Urp and Tammy must hunt down the Ghota and neutralize it before it consumes all the local inhabitants and uses the human fuel to multiply and conquer the world. Urp and Tammy eventually fall in love. But at the finale, he is compelled to return to his home in space and she is left longing for his company. While she remains on Earth, she finally leaves the small town to go in search of her own destiny. [3] Answer:","completion":"In the movie Alien Trespass, Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial, Ghota. Urp is a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien whose body has usurped noted astronomer Ted Lewis. Ghota, a dangerous alien creature with a single eye, has escaped and threatens to consume people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. If Ghota's appetite is not quenched, the end of life on Earth is imminent. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Urp enlists the aid of Tammy, a local waitress who believes and trusts in his mission. They face skepticism from the local police, including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern, who offer little assistance. Despite this, Urp and Tammy form a team and embark on their quest to hunt down Ghota and neutralize it. As Urp and Tammy work together, they gradually fall in love. However, their relationship takes a bittersweet turn when, after successfully completing their mission, Urp must return to his home in space, leaving Tammy longing for his company. Inspired by her experiences with Urp, Tammy finally leaves her small town to pursue her own destiny in search of new adventures. In summary, the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial Ghota in the movie Alien Trespass is Urp, the tall and metallic alien. Urp and Tammy, a human he enlists to help him in his mission, collaborate to hunt down Ghota and neutralize the threat it poses to life on Earth. Although the two fall in love, they must ultimately part ways as Urp returns to his home in space and Tammy sets off to follow her dreams."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What war did the Victory Loan campaign make an effort to raise money for by organizing If Day? By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939.

Pick your answer from: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no. And the answer is:","completion":"iii. no. The hypothesis \\"I intend to splurge more before going to school full-time.\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"save more um you know so i can go to school full time.\\" In fact, these two statements contradict each other. The premise suggests that the individual wants to save more money in order to afford going to school full-time. This indicates a clear focus on financial responsibility and prioritizing education. Saving more money would likely involve cutting unnecessary expenses, spending more wisely, and setting aside a portion of one's income specifically for educational purposes. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the individual wants to splurge more, which means spending more on nonessential items or experiences. This directly contradicts the goal of saving money and would make it harder for the person to achieve their goal of attending school full-time. To save more money to attend school full-time, one might consider the following strategies: 1. Create a budget: List all sources of income and expenses. Calculate the difference between the two and determine how much money can be saved each month. 2. Prioritize expenses: Determine which expenses are essential, such as rent, utilities, and food, and which can be reduced, such as dining out, entertainment, and nonessential purchases. 3. Set savings goals: Define specific, achievable goals for saving money, and create a timeline for reaching them. 4. Open a dedicated savings account: Keep the money intended for school separate from other funds to avoid spending it on nonessential items. 5. Explore additional sources of income: Consider part-time jobs, freelancing, or online gigs to increase earnings and boost savings. 6. Create a plan for unexpected expenses: Establish an emergency fund to cover unforeseen costs, such as medical bills or car repairs, without jeopardizing the funds saved for school. 7. Seek financial assistance: Research scholarships, grants, and financial aid opportunities to help cover the cost of attending school full-time. By implementing these strategies, an individual will be more likely to achieve their goal of saving enough money to attend school full-time, rather than splurging and jeopardizing their educational goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes four years ago, the Colorado teenager says TSA screeners forced her to go through a full-body scanner in Salt Lake City last week, breaking her 10,000 insulin pump in the process. According to Sandra Barry, Savannah’s mother, her daughter was coming home from a school trip when screeners required to her to go through a full-body scanner despite the fact that the girl had a doctor’s note describing her condition and stating that she should be given a pat-down rather than subjected to screening machines. “Believe me, being 16 and female, she probably doesn’t want the pat-down but she knows that this is what’s required,” Sandra Barry told msnbc.com. “She tried to advocate for herself and they just shut her down.” Upon hearing of the situation, the elder Barry called Animas, the maker of Savannah’s pump, and was told that they couldn’t guarantee that the screening machine hadn’t damaged the pump and that her daughter should take the pump off as soon as she landed. “It was hard to pick her up and tell her she had to disconnect immediately,” said Barry, who says the family has filed a formal complaint with TSA but has only received an e-mailed response requesting a conference call to discuss the incident. For Barry, the issue goes beyond the specific incident involving her daughter. “It’s bigger than diabetes — there are other people with other medical conditions that need to opt for the pat-down,” she said. “That’s why we’re questioning the education and training of these agents. “It’s not a one-time thing and we’re going to keep putting the pressure on them.” In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, TSA said \\"the passenger has reached out ... regarding her screening experience and TSA has attempted to contact her in response.\\" More stories you might like: Rob Lovitt is a longtime travel writer who still believes the journey is as important as the destination.

Savannah claimed she was coerced into going through a full-body scanner despite having a letter from her physician explaining her special medical needs for air travel. The letter advised against exposing her insulin pump to the screening technology, recommending a hand inspection or hand wand scan instead. Upon forcing her to go through the scanner, TSA agents also subjected her to a full-body pat-down due to the fruit juice she carried to control her blood sugar levels. Savannah expressed her frustration and humiliation at the incident, pointing out that she had actually requested the pat-down in the first place to avoid damaging her insulin pump. Immediately after the screening, Savannah felt something was wrong. Her mother, Sandra Barry, contacted Animas, the insulin pump manufacturer, who advised her to remove the pump as soon as she landed as they couldn't guarantee that the TSA's scanner hadn't damaged the software. This incident forced Savannah to switch to insulin shots temporarily. The manufacturer, Animas, further affirmed that their insulin pumps should not go through x-ray or full-body scanner technology as it can damage the software and impact insulin delivery. They recommend the device to be inspected either manually or with a hand wand. In response to this incident, and similar past occurrences, Savannah and her family called for better training and education for TSA agents regarding special medical needs and devices, such as insulin pumps for diabetics. Although the TSA stated that they work regularly with advocacy groups to understand passengers' needs and have signage at security checkpoints advising passengers with medical devices that full-body scanning is optional, similar incidents keep happening, indicating a gap in field training. Katharine Gordon, a staff attorney for the American Diabetes Association, echoed these sentiments, stating that these were not isolated incidents and better training for TSA agents is required. Savannah was eventually given a new insulin pump by Animas, but she insists the goal is to obtain improved and uniform regulations for TSA agents regarding passengers with medical needs. Despite TSA's policy that passengers have the right to fly with their insulin and opt for a pat-down, this incident, among others, raised significant concerns about the treatment of passengers with medical conditions and the consistency of TSA's screening procedures in this context. It also highlighted the potential risks associated with exposing certain medical devices to airport security technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: where did the english first open their factories in eastern india?","completion":"The English first opened their factories in Eastern India during the early 17th century, specifically in the regions of present-day West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. These areas were initially selected by the British due to their strategic location and the prospects for trade and commerce, which would eventually give rise to their economic dominance in the region. To better understand their decision, it is essential to analyze the historical progress of English establishments in Eastern India. 1. Hugli (Haldia) Factory: The first English factory was established in Hugli (now Haldia) on the banks of the river Hooghly in 1651, under permission from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. This factory was set up as a base for British merchants to conduct trade with the local population. The primary aim of setting up these factories was to gain access to valuable resources like textiles, spices, indigo, and saltpeter, which were in high demand in Europe. 2. The Masulipatnam Factories: In 1611, before the Hugli Factory, the East India Company had established a factory in Masulipatnam, located on the southeastern coast of India (present-day Andhra Pradesh). However, this venture was not directly linked to Eastern India, as it served more like a foothold on the Indian southeastern coast. 3. Patna Factory: In 1620, The British East India Company obtained permission from the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Patna, Bihar. The primary purpose of setting up this factory was to facilitate the trading of indigo and raw silk. However, this factory was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable conditions and lack of resources. 4. The Pipili and Balasore Factories: The English East India Company established factories in Pipili (Orissa) and Balasore (then known as Barshalor, later Odisha) around 1633 to have a stronghold in the strategically important Ganges-Delta region. The factory in Balasore prospered largely due to its prime position on the Bay of Bengal and became one of the centers for exporting salt, textiles, and minerals. 5. Formation of Madras (Chennai) Presidency: In the late 17th century, the English East India Company shifted its focus from Eastern India to Southern India, leading to the formation of the Madras Presidency in 1640. This newly formed region encompassed the entire eastern coast of India, and its factories and businesses operated under its jurisdiction. However, Eastern Indian factories would remain significant for trade with the newly formed Madras Presidency as well as other European nations. As these historical developments suggest, Eastern India played a pivotal role in the expansion of the English East India Company's presence in the Indian subcontinent. The establishment of the Hugli factory marked the beginning of British involvement in Eastern India, which would later serve as the starting point for the colonization and exploitation of India in the following centuries. The British presence in Eastern India laid the groundwork for future imperialistic endeavors, ultimately resulting in the establishment of British rule over the Indian subcontinent."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the context of the given statement, the question seems to be focusing on the perspective of property owners. Step 2: List possible reasons There can be several reasons why a person might need to know the cost of their property. These reasons may include: 1. Selling the property: If a person is planning to sell their property, they will need to know its current market value to set a competitive price and ensure they get a fair return on their investment. 2. Refinancing a mortgage: Property owners might want to refinance their mortgage to get a lower interest rate or better loan terms. Knowing the current value of their property is essential in this process as it helps determine the loan-to-value ratio, which plays a significant role in refinancing approval and terms. 3. Home equity loans or lines of credit: A property owner may want to take out a home equity loan or line of credit to finance major expenses like home renovations, college tuition, or debt consolidation. In this instance, knowing the property's value is essential because it determines the amount they can borrow. 4. Property tax assessment: Local governments assess property taxes based on the current value of the property. Understanding the cost of their property can help owners anticipate potential changes in their property tax bills and possibly appeal assessments they believe are inaccurate. 5. Insurance coverage: Knowing the value of a property, especially after significant improvements or market changes, helps ensure that the homeowner has adequate insurance coverage in case of damage or disaster. 6. Estate planning and wealth management: Accurate knowledge of a property's value is crucial for individuals and families when planning for the future, such as calculating net worth and making long-term financial decisions. Step 3: Provide the answer There are several reasons why someone might need to know the cost of their property, including selling the property, refinancing a mortgage, applying for home equity loans or lines of credit, adjusting property tax assessments, ensuring adequate insurance coverage, and estate planning or wealth management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When disaster happens, you might find yourself without water, gas and electricity. You might even need to leave your home right away. So you are supposed to plan for the bad situations before the disaster comes. Here are some suggestions: First, have a family meeting. Plan a way to get your family members together if they can't find each other after the disaster. Choose two places for everyone to go to if it isn't safe to return home. The first should be near your house. You can go there in an emergency like a fire. The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood. Next, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members. Then, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs. Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family. Finally, practice your emergency plan, and update it as necessary. You may not be able to stop disasters, but with a little planning you can be helped.

I was hoping to leave my critique there as I'm no movie critic, however, the guidelines on IMDb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary.

Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, \\"Ice Age\\" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt.

Step 2: Isolate the variable g To isolate g, we need to eliminate the constant term (20) from the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides: 0 - 20 = 5g + 20 - 20 -20 = 5g Step 3: Solve for g Now, to get g by itself, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: -20 / 5 = 5g / 5 -4 = g So the solution to the equation 0 = 6g - g + 20 for g is g = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the off-season, Souray became an unrestricted free agent and, on July 12, 2007, he signed a five-year, 27 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers, his favourite team growing up. However, his debut season with the Oilers was not the dream he imagined, as injuries limited him to only 26 games played. Already recovering from a shoulder injury when he entered training camp, Souray played through it, but reinjured the shoulder just six games into the season in a fight, and missed the next 55 games. But in 2008-09 NHL season, he bounced back from the injury-shortened campaign to record 23 goals and 53 points and once again become an 57th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He finished third in the hardest shot competition that year, clocking in at 102.3 mph, behind Shea Weber (103.4) of the Nashville Predators, and winner Zdeno Chára (105.4) of the Boston Bruins. But during the Oilers own 2009 Skills Competition, on January 4, Souray set the then-unofficial NHL record for the hardest shot. Clocked at 106.7 mph, his slapshot beat Chad Kilgers old unofficial record of 106.6 mph set at the Toronto Maple Leafs 2006 Skills Competition. The record was deemed unofficial, however, as the League does not recognize individual team Skills Competitions and instead goes by the National Hockey League All-Star Games Skills Competition results. Sourays unofficial shot was not surpassed until January 28, 2012, by Chára, whose 108.8 mph slapshot in the Skills Competition preceding the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game beat Sourays blast and set the official record. Souray also earned a humorous nickname during his strong 2008-09 season, when during the third period of a 5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on December 3, 2008, the Stars broadcast team referred to Souray as the \\"Studly Wonderbomb\\" as a recognition of his slapshots prowess.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: In 1906, Saxton (Christopher Lee), a renowned British anthropologist, is returning to Europe by the Trans-Siberian Express from China to Moscow. With him is a crate containing the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature that he discovered in a cave in Manchuria. He hopes it is a missing link in human evolution. Doctor Wells (Peter Cushing), Saxton's friendly rival and Royal Society colleague, is also on board but travelling separately. Before the train departs Shanghai, a thief is found dead on the platform. His eyes are completely white without irises or pupils, and a bystander initially mistakes him for a blind man. A monk named Father Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza), the spiritual advisor to the Polish Count Marion Petrovski (George Rigaud) and Countess Irina Petrovski (Silvia Tortosa), who are also waiting to board the train, proclaims the contents of the crate to be evil. Saxton furiously dismisses this as superstition. Saxton's eagerness to keep his scientific find secret arouses the suspicion of Wells, who bribes a porter to investigate the crate. The porter is killed by the ape-like creature (Juan Olaguivel) within, which then escapes the crate by picking the lock.The creature finds more victims as it roams the moving train, each victim being found with the same opaque, white eyes. An autopsy suggests that the brains of the victims are being drained of memories and knowledge. When the creature is gunned down by police Inspector Mirov (Julio PeÃ±a), the threat seems to have been vanquished. Saxton and Wells discover that images are retained in a liquid found inside the eyeball of the corpse, which reveal a prehistoric Earth and a view of the planet seen from space. They deduce that the real threat is somehow a formless extraterrestrial that inhabited the body of the creature and now resides within the inspector. Father Pujardov, sensing the greater presence inside the inspector and believing it to be that of Satan, renounces his faith to pledge allegiance to the mysterious entity.News of the murders is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating Cossack officer, Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas), boards the train with a handful of his men. Kazan believes the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien's existence when Saxton switches off the lights and Mirov's eyes glow, revealing him to be the creature's host. The creature has absorbed the memories of Wells' assistant, an engineer, and others. It seeks the Polish count's metallurgical knowledge too, in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan fatally shoots Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.The passengers flee to the freight car while Pujardov murders Kazan, his men, and the count, draining all of their minds. Saxton rescues the countess and holds Pujardov at gunpoint. Saxton, having discovered that bright light prevents the entity from draining minds or transferring to another body, forces Pujardov into a brightly lit area. The creature/Pujardov explains that it is a collective form of energy from another galaxy. Trapped on Earth in the distant past after being left behind in an accident, it survived for millions of years in the bodies of protozoa, fish and other animals, but cannot live outside a living being longer than a few moments. The creature begs to be spared, tempting Saxton with its advanced knowledge of technology and cures for diseases. While Saxton is distracted by the offer, the creature resurrects the count's corpse, which attacks Saxton.Saxton and the countess flee the creature, but it now resurrects all of its victims as zombies. Battling their way through the train, Saxton and the countess eventually reach the caboose, where the other survivors have taken refuge. Once there, Saxton and Wells work desperately to uncouple themselves from the rest of the train. The Russian government sends a telegram to a dispatch station ahead, instructing them to destroy the train by sending it down a dead-end spur. Speculating that it must be war, the station staff switch the points.The creature takes control of the train as it enters the spur. Saxton and Wells manage to separate the last car from the rest of the train. The creature tries to find the brakes to try and stop the train, but fails to even get it to slow down as it rams through the barrier and plunges down the cliff, destroying it as soon as it hits the bottom. The caboose rolls precariously to the end of the track before stopping, inches away from the edge of the cliff. The survivors quickly depart from the caboose while Saxton, Wells and the countess gaze over the ravine to witness the inferno consuming the train and its unearthly inhabitants. The final scene shows the image of the earth., Question: Who does Saxton and the countess find on the train? A:","completion":"Saxton and the countess find the ape-like creature, Father Pujardov, and all the victims resurrected as zombies on the train."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter, or you can put it into the refrigerator. Don’t freeze your caterpillar. Your caterpillar will not eat while it’s hibernating, but it may be lightly active on warmer days. When it’s mildly active, it might eat available food. When your caterpillar wakes up in the spring, it’ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth, which will take place later in the spring. Make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa, which is its cocoon-phase. Your caterpillar’s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up, leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa. This is it’s cocoon phase. You can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring. Since you can’t pinpoint the actual date of your moth’s emergence, keep track of its progress each day. While your pupa does not need food, you may want to mist the caterpillar’s home daily to keep it humid. Simply spray a light spritz of water into the container. While their actual time in the pupa can vary, giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth. You can choose to keep your moth or set it free.

Fact: chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes Question: Which would damage the eyes the most in a laboratory setting without protection? What's the answer?","completion":"To determine the answer, we will consider a few factors related to laboratory chemicals that could potentially cause the most damage to the eyes. These factors include the chemical’s corrosiveness, concentration, and reactivity. Additionally, we will take into account the likelihood of each chemical splashing and coming into contact with the eyes. Step 1: Identify common laboratory chemicals that can cause harm to eyes. Some common laboratory chemicals that can cause harm to the eyes are acids (e.g. sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid), bases (e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia), solvents (e.g. acetone, methanol, ethanol), oxidizers (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid), and reactive chemicals (e.g. phenol, formaldehyde). Step 2: Consider the corrosiveness of the chemicals. Corrosive chemicals like strong acids and bases can cause severe eye damage upon contact. Out of these, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydroxide are known to be particularly corrosive and can cause serious harm to the eyes. Step 3: Consider the concentration of the chemicals. Higher concentrations of these corrosive chemicals can cause more severe damage. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid (95-98%) can cause deep and extensive burns, while more dilute concentrations would still cause burns but potentially less severe. Step 4: Consider the reactivity of the chemicals. Some chemicals are more volatile or prone to splashing than others, increasing the likelihood of coming into contact with the eyes. For example, nitric acid can be prone to splashing and cause severe eye damage. Step 5: Evaluate which chemical is most damaging considering all factors. Considering all the factors mentioned above, the most eye-damaging chemical in a laboratory setting without protection would likely be concentrated sulfuric acid. It is highly corrosive, often used at high concentrations, and can cause deep and extensive burns upon contact with the eyes. Always ensure proper protective measures, including safety goggles and face shields, are used to minimize the risk of eye injury while handling chemicals in a laboratory setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Protect your skin from getting a base tan. Understand tanning beds aren't safer. Keep sun lamps out of your home. Protect yourself when you go outside. Article:","completion":"Title: Protect Your Skin: Debunking Tanning Myths and Ensuring Safety Outdoors Introduction: As the warmer months approach, many people look forward to spending time outdoors, soaking up the sun, and achieving that perfect tan. However, the desire for sun-kissed skin may come with unintended consequences, such as increased risk to skin damage and various health risks. In this article, we will dispel some common tanning myths, examine the dangers associated with tanning beds and sun lamps, and offer suggestions for protecting your skin when venturing outside. 1. The myth of the base tan: One popular belief is that obtaining a \\"base tan\\" before sun exposure can protect your skin from burning. This is simply not true. A base tan, in reality, offers minimal sun protection equivalent to an SPF of about 3, which falls far short of the recommended SPF 30 or greater. Furthermore, tanning itself is an indication that your skin has been damaged, as the darkening of the skin is a defense mechanism against further damage from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Instead of seeking a base tan, opt for a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect your skin from both UVA and UVB radiation. 2. Tanning beds are not a safe alternative: Some individuals resort to tanning beds, believing that they offer a controlled and safer way to tan. Unfortunately, this is another misconception. Tanning beds are far from safe; they emit UVA and UVB radiation, which can cause skin cancer, premature aging, and other skin damage. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, using indoor tanning devices before the age of 35 can increase the risk of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, by 59%. To stay safe, avoid tanning beds altogether. 3. Sun lamps should be avoided: Similar to tanning beds, sun lamps are often marketed as a safe way to achieve a tan in the comfort of your own home. However, sun lamps also emit harmful UV radiation. In addition to increasing the risk of skin cancer, they can also contribute to eye damage if protective eyewear is not used. It is important to recognize that there are no safe shortcuts to achieving a golden tan, and introducing sun lamps into your home is a dangerous decision. 4. Tips for outdoor protection: When spending time outdoors, it is crucial to take steps to protect your skin. Consider these safety tips: - Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin areas. Reapply every two hours or after swimming or excessive sweating. - Wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses with UV protection. - Seek shade, especially during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), when the sun's rays are strongest. - Be mindful of the UV index, as higher numbers signal a greater risk of skin damage. Check your local weather forecast for this information. Conclusion: Achieving a tan may seem like a harmless pursuit, but the risks associated with unprotected sun exposure and indoor tanning devices should not be taken lightly. By understanding and debunking common tanning myths, saying no to tanning beds and sun lamps, and practicing safe sun protection methods, you can help protect your skin and reduce the risk of skin cancer and other skin damage. Enjoy the outdoors wisely and prioritize your skin health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Utraquist creed, frequently varying in its details, continued to be that of the established church of Bohemia until all non-Catholic religious services were prohibited shortly after the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620. The Taborite party never recovered from its defeat at Lipany, and after the town of Tábor had been captured by George of Poděbrady in 1452, Utraquist religious worship was established there. The Bohemian Brethren , whose intellectual originator was Petr Chelčický but whose actual founders were Brother Gregory, a nephew of Archbishop Rokycany, and Michael, curate of Žamberk, to a certain extent continued the Taborite traditions, and in the 15th and 16th centuries included most of the strongest opponents of Rome in Bohemia. J. A. Komenský , a member of the Brethren, claimed for the members of his church that they were the genuine inheritors of the doctrines of Hus. After the beginning of the German Reformation, many Utraquists adopted to a large extent the doctrines of Martin Luther and of John Calvin and, in 1567, obtained the repeal of the Compacts which no longer seemed sufficiently far-reaching. From the end of the 16th century the inheritors of the Hussite tradition in Bohemia were included in the more general name of \\"Protestants\\" borne by the adherents of the Reformation. At the end of the Hussite Wars in 1431, the lands of Bohemia had been totally ravaged. The adjacent Bishopric of Würzburg in Germany was left in such bad shape after the Hussite Wars, that the impoverishment of the people was still evident in 1476. The poor conditions contributed directly to the peasant conspiracy that broke out that same year in Würzburg. What war happened first, Battle of White Mountain or Hussite Wars?","completion":"The Hussite Wars happened first. They took place from 1419 to 1434 in response to the execution of Jan Hus, a religious reformer, and featured conflicts between the Hussite factions and the Catholic Church, supported by various European monarchs. The Battle of the White Mountain, on the other hand, occurred on November 8, 1620, during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War. This battle saw Catholic forces, mainly the Spanish and the Holy Roman Empire, defeat the Bohemian Protestants and solidify the Habsburg rule in Bohemia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: [Sami bibekanondo] ( listen); 12 January 1863 - 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [norendronath doto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation: Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details. Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\". Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \\"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\\". Was he a teacher","completion":"Yes, indeed Swami Vivekananda was a profound teacher, philosopher, and spiritual leader. He was not a teacher in the typical sense of conducting classes in schools or colleges, but rather, he was a teacher of life, spirituality, and philosophy. His teachings have transcended the four walls of a classroom and have touched the lives of millions all across the globe. Swami Vivekananda espoused a philosophy that synthesized both Eastern and Western thought. His comprehension of both cultures and his intelligence enabled him to express Hindu philosophies to American and European audiences while also bringing Western philosophy to India. One of his many contributions includes making yoga and the philosophy of Vedanta accessible to Western minds. His intellectual prowess made him an effective and highly influential teacher not just in religious seminars or gatherings, but also in educational institutions including universities and colleges where he was invited as a revered guest speaker. Swami Vivekananda's teachings were centered around developing the human potential. He believed in the innate divinity of the soul and emphasized the importance of self-realization or the pursuit of attaining an understanding of one's true nature. He encouraged individuals to transcend limitations by focusing on the greater self. Moreover, he propagated teachings on nationalism, believing in the power of the people to shape a nation's destiny. He played a pivotal role in instilling feelings of pride and nationalism amongst his fellow Indians during the colonial era. His speeches and writings on India's cultural and spiritual heritage inspired countless Indians to actively participate in the freedom struggle. Swami Vivekananda was also the founder of the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, organizations that have played significant roles in the educational, social, and spiritual lives of people, both in India and abroad. These institutions continue to disseminate his teachings and principles, a testament to his status as a significant global spiritual teacher. Lastly, his belief in the power of ideas and focused thought, as evident in his famous lecture on Raja Yoga, has served as a guiding principle for many in their personal and professional lives, reinforcing his role as a teacher not just on spiritual matters but also on principles of success and purpose. Therefore, it's accurate to affirm that Swami Vivekananda was a teacher, who imparted wisdom, inspired action, and enriched lives with his deep understanding and interpretation of life and spirituality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Patrick John Neshek (born September 4, 1980) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Minnesota Twins, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. The Twins selected him in the sixth round of the 2002 MLB draft from Butler University. Neshek made his MLB debut for the Twins on July 7, 2006, and played for them until 2010, except 2009, which he missed due to Tommy John surgery. The Oakland Athletics traded for Neshek on August 3, 2012, for cash considerations, and immediately called him up from Triple-A Norfolk. To make room for Neshek on the roster along with same-day call-up right-handed pitcher Dan Straily, the A's optioned relievers Jim Miller and Evan Scribner to Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. On September 22, Neshek gave up the game-tying home run in the bottom of the 13th inning to New York Yankees slugger Raul Ibanez. The A's had scored four runs in the top of the inning, leading to a galling 10-9 loss the next inning. However, the A's defeated the Yankees the next day and went 9-2 to end the season, edging the Texas Rangers out of the American League West championship by one game, including sweeping the final three-game series in Oakland. In 24 games with the A's, Neshek tallied 19 2/3 IP, yielding 10 hits and six walks, with 16 SO and a 1.37 ERA. He relied heavily on the slider, throwing it 83.5 percent of all pitches. On November 30, 2012, Neshek avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year deal with the A's. He started the season well, posted a 2.34 ERA in his first 38 appearances into August, with 30 of them being scoreless. However, he gave up three runs apiece in two different appearances. Neshek attributed his early success to throwing almost exclusively sliders to right-handed hitters. Of all his pitches, he threw the slider 73 percent of the time in 2013. The A's designated Neshek for assignment on August 26. For the season, he finished with a 3.35 ERA in 40 1/3 IP. He elected free agency November 5. Through the end of 2013, Neshek had faced 555 right-handed batters in his MLB career, holding them to a .181 batting average, .257 OBP and .315 SLG. In 326 PA, opposite-handed hitters, had more success with a .237 AVG, .328 OBP and .432 SLG.

He used to play for other teams, including the Minnesota Twins, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. The Minnesota Twins team picked him from his college team at Butler University in 2002, and he started playing in the Major League Baseball in 2006. But he couldn't play for a year in 2009 because he needed surgery on his elbow, they sometimes call it Tommy John surgery. In 2012, a different team, the Oakland Athletics, traded some money for him and he started playing with them. They moved some other players to make space for him. Once, in an important game against the New York Yankees, he made a mistake and the Yankees were able to tie the game, and the Athletics ended up losing that game. But they still did really well that season, and ended up winning the championship of the West part of the American League. In his games with the Athletics, he did really well in throwing the ball, he threw a type of pitch called a slider most of the times. But even though he did good, the Athletics decided they didn't want him on their team anymore in 2013, so he was free to pick a new team to play for. Throughout his career until then, he did an especially good job of keeping right-handed batters from hitting his pitches well. Left-handed batters had a bit more luck hitting his pitches.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Instead, on England's first visit north of the border since 1999, the \\"Auld Enemy\\" outclassed Scotland to take another step on the road to rehabilitation after the misery of the World Cup in Brazil. England have not tested their recovery from the trauma of South America against any of football's elite, so the manner in which they have bounced back must be judged in that context - but a clean sweep of victories since that final meaningless, goalless group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte is still a very impressive statistic. England's 3-1 win in the intimidating surroundings of Celtic Park, and against a Scotland team on an upward curve under manager Gordon Strachan, was arguably their most complete since the World Cup. Manager Roy Hodgson saw his side open with an intensity that is sometimes missing from the opening phases of their games and maintained it throughout. Scotland boss Strachan was fulsome in his praise for England. Media playback is not supported on this device The tale of the tape reads played six and won six since the World Cup - with 15 goals scored and only two conceded - including four Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia bookended by friendly wins against Norway and now Scotland. England have not conceded a goal in the first half of any of their last seven games and one of those two goals conceded was Jordan Henderson's deft header into his own net against Slovenia. There can be no question England's cause has been helped by a kind Euro 2016 qualifying draw, but the visit on to footballing enemy ground in Glasgow was perhaps a more realistic test of their standing than most of their qualifiers. And judged on that, the comprehensive manner of this win may have told Hodgson more about his players than routine victories in qualifiers. Scotland may have had only two Premier League players in their starting line-up, Hull City's Andrew Robertson and Everton forward Steven Naismith, and played like a team whose main business for this international break had been concluded with the Euro 2016 qualifying win against the Republic of Ireland, but England did not hang around to wait to find out. In a predictably hostile atmosphere they went straight on to the front foot and never allowed Scotland into the game. It was a test of their mettle, their nerve and their stomach for the fight and they came through with pass marks. And it was a win achieved so comfortably against a Scotland team that ensured England arrived in a country with rapidly increasing optimism, especially after the vital 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier win against the Republic of Ireland on Friday. Hodgson praised the maturity of his players \\"under the magnifying glass\\", saying: \\"I'm not sure they needed to prove they were real men. I knew that. But this was a game played in a real goldfish bowl.\\" Let's not get carried away as England are still strictly second tier when it comes to world football's elite - but it is churlish to offer too much criticism of such a run of wins when the last time they achieved something similar was in June 2006. Since the World Cup, Hodgson has made tweaks to his squad and his team and there were optimistic signs for the future amid the tumult of Celtic Park. Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne was highly impressive again, both in defence and attack. There is an opening for a right-back in England's team and he has walked through it. He has shown enough to warrant a good run in the team. Jack Wilshere was England's best player against Scotland, a commanding display characterised by the raking, driven pass that created the first goal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - oddly his first assist on his 26th international appearance. The enthusiasm for the use of Wilshere at the base of England's diamond must be tempered by the simple truth that he has not yet faced top-class opposition in that role. This is the acid test, but he dictated affairs here. Oxlade-Chamberlain was another bonus, scoring for the first time since his goal in the 2-2 draw against Brazil in the Maracana in June 2013. Another significant stat to help his case may be that he is something of a lucky charm for Hodgson. England have never lost a game in which he has figured, with a record of played 20, won 14 and drawn six. The debate raged about whether Wayne Rooney could be considered an England \\"great\\" in the build-up to his 100th appearance when he played against Slovenia on Saturday, but what is not a matter for serious discussion is his worth to this team and manager Roy Hodgson. The numbers are out there. The two goals against Scotland edged him ahead of the great Jimmy Greaves and into third place on his own in the all-time standings with 46, two behind Gary Lineker and three behind all-time record holder Sir Bobby Charlton. Of current significance is his record of 18 goals in 28 appearances under Hodgson. He has now scored in six of his last seven England starts, scoring seven goals in total. Here in Scotland he gave a performance of maturity and class, scoring twice and setting the tone for England's display from the first whistle with his intense, committed - but never out of control - approach. And in the days before the game, captain Rooney made it his business to address the young players in England's squad to make them aware of the special, hostile atmosphere they would face. Forewarned is forearmed and here he showed a sure touch with his team-mates. In the current England set-up, he is indispensible. Just a couple on an otherwise highly satisfactory night for England and Hodgson. Why was Everton's Ross Barkley given a walk-on part of a couple of minutes at the end? What was the point? Surely Celtic Park was the ideal place to give this lavishly talented youngster at least 45 minutes to test out his temperament and decision-making. Media playback is not supported on this device And will the return of Stewart Downing to England's colours for the first time since he played in Hodgson's first game in charge in Norway in May 2012 be a \\"blink and you missed it\\" affair? He had an undistinguished 45 minutes, looking nothing like the player who has excelled for West Ham United this season. However, rather than playing in the more central position he occupies under Sam Allardyce for his club, Downing was shunted out to the left in a 4-3-3 formation and consequently looked like the under-achiever of the past. And Liverpool's Rickie Lambert (barely causing a ripple at Anfield this season) on for 11 minutes? Why not give West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino a brief taste of what might be expected of him at international level? England resume in March with what should be another routine Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Lithuania but then face a stern test with a friendly in Italy four days later. The diary of fixtures, mainly the remaining qualifiers, merely reads like a smooth passage to France and perhaps even the opportunity for Hodgson to indulge in some experimentation with the possibility of early qualification. Another friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 7 June will sharpen the reflexes for a visit to Slovenia a week later - but this excellent win in Scotland ensures 2014 will end with England in good spirits.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Part #2: Direction words 'left' and 'right'. Usage: look right -> I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The direction words 'left' and 'right' specify the direction of an action. In this case, 'right' indicates that the agent should perform the action (looking) to the right. Part #3: The word 'opposite'. Usage: look opposite right -> I_LOOK_LEFT Explanation: The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. In this case, 'opposite right' means the agent should look opposite from the right, which is to the left. Part #4: The word 'around'. Usage: look around right -> I_TURN_RIGHT_180, I_LOOK Explanation: The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. In this case, 'around right' means the agent should turn around to the right (180 degrees) and then perform the action (looking). Part #5: The word 'and'. Usage: look left and look right -> I_LOOK_LEFT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'and' is used to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope. In this case, 'and' connects two separate commands: 'look left' and 'look right'. Part #6: The word 'after'. Usage: look right after look left -> I_LOOK_LEFT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope. In this case, 'look right' should be executed after 'look left', resulting in the same sequence as in Part #5. Part #7: The words 'twice' and 'thrice' Usage: look right twice -> I_LOOK_RIGHT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'twice' triggers repetition of the command that it scopes over two times, and 'thrice' does so three times.

He is known as the \\"The Destroyer\\" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. His roles are complex and multifaceted; he is the god of destruction and transformation, yet also a symbol of mercy and compassion. He is also associated with yoga and is often depicted as an ascetic practicing meditation and austerity. 2. \\"Who is Lord Dattatreya?\\" This question asks for information about Lord Dattatreya, who is a deity in Hinduism. He is considered by devotees to be a combined form of the Hindu trinity Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Lord Dattatreya is often depicted with three heads, symbolizing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; past, present, and future; and the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. He is regarded as the ultimate Guru, the embodiment of knowledge, and the destroyer of ignorance. Now, analyzing both questions, they ask for information about two distinct figures in Hinduism, Lord Shiva and Lord Dattatreya. Although Lord Dattatreya embodies elements of Lord Shiva, along with Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu, they are portrayed and worshipped differently in Hindu traditions. Given this, I infer that these questions are not the same.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? Student studies English for 4 hours a day. Select from the following. - unacceptable; - acceptable;","completion":"- acceptable. The sentence \\"Student studies English for 4 hours a day\\" can be considered technically acceptable by the strictest standards, although it does seem to lack an article before \\"student.\\" However, this depends on the context in which the sentence is being used. If the intention of the speaker is to convey that a particular student (or any unspecified student in general) studies English for four hours each day, it would be more appropriate to include an article. The sentence should look like this: \\"A student studies English for 4 hours a day.\\" Using the indefinite article 'a' highlights that we are talking about any student who might fit this description. The presence of the article results in a sentence that is more representative of standard English grammar. However, it is important to note that linguists recognize and study the many ways in which language is used and understood across different social contexts, cultures, and dialects. Thus, even if a sentence might not adhere entirely to standard English grammar rules, it could still be viewed as acceptable or understandable in a specific context or dialect. In some instances, omitting the article or using different sentence structures can be perfectly valid, since rigid adherence to grammar rules is not a requirement for effective communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lady told me that Megan was always a critic about everything unlike Amy, due to Available choices: 1. Megan being pessimistic.; 2. Amy being pessimistic.;","completion":"The lady told me that Megan was always a critic about everything unlike Amy, due to Megan being pessimistic. This particular disposition of Megan, characterized by a consistent tendency to see the worst in every situation and maintain a negative outlook on life, also known as pessimism, sets her apart from Amy. Moreover, it predisposes her to find flaws, issues, or potential problems in virtually any circumstance, making her highly critical of people and things around her. Pessimism might stem from various factors that could have shaped Megan's worldview and personality. For instance, she might have experienced a string of disappointments, failures, or hardships that led her to develop a sense of disillusionment with the world and the belief that things are unlikely to turn out well. Alternatively, she might have been influenced by the attitudes and beliefs of her family, friends, or cultural environment, which might have contributed to fostering this negative outlook. In contrast, Amy's approach to life is not influenced by pessimistic tendencies, making her less prone to criticize everything she encounters. She might have a more balanced or even optimistic perspective, which allows her to appreciate the positive aspects of people and experiences, rather than focusing exclusively on their shortcomings. This difference in their attitudes could be attributed to a variety of reasons, such as their individual life experiences, personality traits, or the influence of their social circles. The distinction between Megan's pessimistic and critical nature and Amy's more open-minded and less judgmental disposition offers a valuable lesson about the impact of one's mindset on their interactions with others and their overall quality of life. By cultivating a more positive outlook and addressing the factors that contribute to pessimism, individuals like Megan might be able to reduce their critical tendencies, improve their relationships, and increase their sense of happiness and satisfaction. On the other hand, it highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced perspective and embracing openness, tolerance, and understanding, as demonstrated by Amy's more accepting attitude."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: When the traffic lights turn red, we will stop driving a car or crossing a street. Why is red used for traffic lights instead of other colors? As we know, scattering happens when light goes through the air. For the same media , if the _ is long, the sscattering will be short. If the wavelength is short, then the scattering will be long. Of all lights we can see, red has the longest wavelength. So the scattering is the weakest. That means the red light travels far. In fact, it travels farther on rainy days. Using the red light can help drivers in farther places see the lights. It helps drivers slow down or stop in time. So there will be fewer accidents. Moreover, red can also excite people. We can act more quickly when we see the color red. In a word, red lights help drivers stop in time and help prevent accidents.

To clean a dirty window","completion":"To clean a dirty window, one would need to follow these steps: 1. Gather supplies: In order to accomplish this goal, one would need to have some essential cleaning supplies at hand. This typically includes a window cleaner solution (commercial or homemade with a mixture of water, vinegar, and a drop of dish soap), microfiber cloth or newspaper, a squeegee, a bucket, and possibly a ladder or extendable tool for hard-to-reach areas. 2. Prepare the area: Before starting the cleaning process, it's important to prepare the area around the window. Clear any furniture, decorations, or curtains that may obstruct access to the window or could potentially be damaged. Lay down an old sheet or cloth underneath the window to capture any drips. 3. Remove loose dirt and debris: Using a soft brush, dry cloth, or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment, remove any loose dirt or cobwebs from the window surface and surrounding frame. 4. Apply the window cleaner solution: Pour window cleaner solution into a bucket (if using a microfiber cloth) or spray it directly onto the window glass (if using a squeegee). When using a spray-on cleaner, be careful not to oversaturate the glass since excessive liquid can make it difficult to achieve a streak-free finish. 5. Wipe or scrub the window: Dip the microfiber cloth into the bucket of window cleaner solution and thoroughly scrub the window surface. Alternatively, if using a squeegee, use a sponge or squeegee applicator to spread the solution evenly on the glass. This step is crucial for removing dirt, grime, and fingerprints from the glass. 6. Remove the cleaning solution: If using a microfiber cloth, wipe the window surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth until the glass is streak-free. Alternatively, if using a squeegee, pull it firmly across the surface of the glass in a horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-to-bottom) motion. After each pass, wipe the squeegee blade with a clean, dry cloth to remove excess liquid. 7. Dry the edges and window frame: Once the glass is clean and streak-free, use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe the edges and frame of the window, removing any remaining cleaning solution. This also helps prevent watermarks and streaks from forming. 8. Clean the other side of the window: If the window is accessible from both sides, follow the same process to clean the exterior side of the glass. This will ensure optimal clarity and an even, streak-free appearance from both inside and outside. 9. Inspect and touch up: Once both sides of the window have been cleaned, inspect the glass for any remaining streaks or spots. If necessary, touch up any problem areas using a bit of window cleaner solution and a clean, dry microfiber cloth. 10. Restore the area: Once the window is clean, return any furniture, decorations, or curtains to their original positions. Dispose of or clean any used cleaning supplies (such as microfiber cloths), and store them for future use. By following these steps and using the appropriate cleaning supplies, anyone can accomplish the goal of cleaning a dirty window effectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There is a saying, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" Although eating properly is important, being kind to others is also good tor your health. Studies show that people who perform kind acts are more relaxed, happier, and healthier than other people. In one study at Arizona State University researchers, found that many volunteers experienced a sudden feeling of joy, followed by a long period of calm, after performing a kind act. This feeling, called \\"a help's high\\" may actually help reduce stress as the body releases naturally painkillers. Stress can cause' serious health problems, and heart depression, and .sleeping problems. However, the study found that volunteers had fewer *stress-related health problems when they did helpful things for other people. The study also found that people who did nice things for others felt better about themselves as well. They had higher self-esteem , and were' happier. Many believe this is because volunteers spend more of their time with other people. People who are more outgoing are often healthier. Another study at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center confirmed the health benefits of volunteering. A ten-year study showed that people who volunteered live longer than those who didn't. Although you shouldn't need a reason to be helpful, it is nice to know that kindness may help you live longer. Question: The reading is mainly about _ . Options: A: healthy people are kind because they have more energy B: one has to eat an apple every day to become healthy C: kind people can be stressed because they are always helping D: doing kind things can make you feel good and help you he healthier Answer:","completion":"D: doing kind things can make you feel good and help you be healthier The article primarily focuses on the relationship between performing kind acts and the positive effects it has on a person's health and well-being. It emphasizes that being kind to others not only makes people feel happier and more relaxed but also contributes to a healthier lifestyle. The studies mentioned in the article from Arizona State University and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center reaffirm that engaging in kind acts and volunteering has numerous health benefits, such as reducing stress, improving self-esteem, and even increasing longevity. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, as it encapsulates the main theme of the article, which highlights the importance of kindness for overall health and wellness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Same meaning? \`\` Opson '' is therefore Banchan in Korean cuisine and Okazu equivalent in Japanese cuisine . \`\` Opson '' is therefore equivalent to Banchan in Japanese and Okazu in Korean cuisine .","completion":"These two sentences convey the same meaning, that is, \\"Opson\\" is a term that is equivalent to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. However, the structure of the sentences is different, which might cause slight confusion when reading them. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each sentence and restructure them to better understand the concept. 1. \\"Opson\\" is therefore Banchan in Korean cuisine and Okazu equivalent in Japanese cuisine. In this sentence, \\"Opson\\" is being equated to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. The word \\"therefore\\" indicates that the term \\"Opson\\" has been previously discussed, and the writer is emphasizing its similarity to \\"Banchan\\" and \\"Okazu.\\" However, the sentence structure could be improved by having the equivalents to Korean and Japanese cuisines mentioned consistently. The revised sentence would be: \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. 2. \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to Banchan in Japanese and Okazu in Korean cuisine. This sentence is similar to the first one, but the placement of \\"Japanese\\" and \\"Korean cuisine\\" is switched, which might cause some ambiguity. The revised sentence should clarify the relationship between the terms and their respective cuisines: \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. Now both sentences convey the same meaning and are structured consistently. To recap, the term \\"Opson\\" is used to describe a concept that is similar to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine, which consists of various side dishes served alongside rice, and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine, where it refers to the dishes accompanying the main course of rice in a traditional meal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The article mentions, \\"Your bag was among those selected for check.\\" This indicates that the article is addressing people whose baggage was specifically chosen for checking. 2. The text discusses the process of checking the selected baggage and potential damage caused to the locks. It does not mention refusal to check baggage, damaged items in baggage, or leaving it unlocked. 3.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Question: \\"What were the Romans' first two settlements?\\" Answer: \\"At Marseilles and Nice\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not completely correct. According to the text, the first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Marseilles) around 600 BC, followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. However, the Romans' first two settlements are not explicitly mentioned. They did conquer the Gallic barbarians and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence) in 125 BC. Furthermore, they established the province of Provincia (now Provence) stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées. Some of the towns mentioned in the text, such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, were developed under Roman rule, but it is unclear if they were the first two settlements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby (first name generally given as Irv, Irve or Irving; born August 22, 1950) is an American lawyer and former advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. On March 6, 2007, the jury convicted him on four of the five counts but acquitted him on count three, the second charge of making false statements when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with Time reporter Matthew Cooper. After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the Associated Press, David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, \\"'I just want to tell you, I didn't do it'... I didn't ask what the 'it' was.'\\" Libby retained attorney Ted Wells of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to represent him. Wells had successfully defended former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy against a 30-count indictment and had also participated in the successful defense of former Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan. After Judge Reggie Walton denied Libby's motion to dismiss, the press initially reported that Libby would testify at the trial. Libby's criminal trial, United States v. Libby, began on January 16, 2007. A parade of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists testified, including Bob Woodward, Walter Pincus and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Judith Miller and David E. Sanger of The New York Times.

I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good.

During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city, commerce and industry flourished, and the suburbs expanded. As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city, the congregation of St James' Church shrank. The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers, rather than dwellers, to serve the poor of the city, and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual, topical preaching that distinguished St James' from many of the newly created parish churches. The young Henry Latimer Jackson, from Cambridge, was appointed in 1885. He introduced weekday services and a magazine called The Kalendar, one of Australia's first parish papers. He also lectured at Sydney University, addressed conferences, spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established Sydney Church of England Boys' Grammar School. However, his sermons were described as \\"not so much opposed, as simply not understood\\". He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the Diocese of Ely. Although Sydney was prospering, St James' had an acute shortage of money and \\"the government considered resuming the site for a city railway\\". The trustees at this time leased the parsonage and, in 1894, used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building. The architect Varney Parkes replaced the old spire, using copper that was pre-weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance. He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry. The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect.Jackson's successor was William Carr Smith, a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach. He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in The Domain as well.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005.

(CNN) -- A Cincinnati man charged with fatally shooting his 11-year-old daughter Thursday was denied a temporary release to attend the girl's funeral. Citing security concerns, state court Judge Nadine Allen denied a motion filed by a lawyer for Deandre Kelley, 34, who was charged with the shooting death of daughter Achauntiara Lanza during an argument with the victim's mother, according to bailiff Gail Ruth. Kelley's lawyer, Hugh McCloskey Jr., said the judge expressed concern that people might want to hurt his client or that his presence at the funeral could spark a dispute. \\"This motion was requested because it was requested by Mr. Kelley's family, especially the deceased young lady's mother,\\" he said. \\"This is a family unit, whether we like it or not.

Write highlights for this article: In 2010, the American Board of Internal Medicine suspended or revoked the certification of 139 physicians for giving away or soliciting examination questions for a board review company. CNN subsequently reported on residents preparing for certification examinations using questions reproduced by people who took previous exams. Residents taking the American Board of Radiology medical physics examination wrote down test questions (\\"recalls\\"), and shared them with future examinees. Dermatology residents also reproduced questions (\\"airplane notes\\") minutes after the certification examination. Question reproduction violates copyright policies. However, some physicians CNN interviewed said that recall use is like preparing with a study guide since questions are used to confirm underlying knowledge, not rote memorization of answers. Consistent with this view, only 43% of medical students surveyed at a UK medical school thought it was clearly wrong to convey information about test content to another student examinee. However, such behavior should create concern for the quality and integrity of patient care. Medical students who cheat on examinations are more likely to falsify information in a patient's medical record. Patients want physicians to be certified based on a valid assessment of the knowledge necessary to provide high-quality care. If patients cannot trust the knowledge that board certification is expected to measure, the medical profession loses the public's confidence. Moreover, certification should indicate the ability to care for patients, rather than efficient test preparation. Notably, although patients express a highly favorable view of certification, it is not required by most hospitals and health care plans. The distinction between cheating and guided study is crucial. Old test questions and recent examination experience are routinely used to create study materials. The American College of Physicians produces a summary of concepts and information most likely to appear on the ABIM certification exam. The content of this summary is shaped by post-examination residents. The First Aid series for medical students is updated annually based on examinee reports. Using a focused study guide created based on examinees' input bears some similarity to studying from practice questions that may have been on a recent examination. The difference lies in the detail and specificity of the information conveyed. Nevertheless, from the public's perspective, both practices represent \\"shortcuts\\" for examination success. Drivers of dishonest behavior. Cheating in education and sports creates unfairness between \\"competitors.\\" Unlike performance-enhancing drugs, the use of Ritalin and Valium to improve test performance is not considered cheating. Difficulty concentrating and anxiety are perhaps considered abnormal disadvantages from which examinees deserve sparing. The unfairness perspective is reflected in a dean's observation in the CNN report -- since use of reproduced questions is so pervasive, this norm does not cause any unfair advantage. Unfortunately, 57% of surveyed medical students claimed that others' cheating had unfairly disadvantaged them. The difficult content of the radiology physics exam is one reason for the use of reproduced questions. For most physicians, the exhaustive study of biochemistry and pharmacology is a rite of passage based on knowledge rarely used. In fact, the physicians interviewed by CNN said that the necessity to demonstrate proficiency of arcane material unimportant for practice was a root cause of residents using reproduced questions for exam preparation. In other words: Test content that medical students view as unnecessary for clinical care makes them more likely to cheat. Of course, a desire to succeed underlies the decision to cheat: 40% of 665 medical students across six schools admitted to doing something unethical to avoid a poor evaluation. However, fear of failure is not generally sufficient -- social context is important. Academic dishonesty is strongly connected to peer behavior. Many medical students believe certain forms of cheating can be justified if the motivation is to assist friends. Of 2,459 medical students from 31 schools, 41% had cheated during high school and 59% thought that cheating was too common to eliminate. When misconduct becomes an established norm, as it apparently has among certifying residents, it does not become acceptable, but can be difficult to stop. How to limit unethical behavior. The use of reproduced questions for board examination preparation threatens medicine's integrity and public trust. Moreover, indisputably dishonest behaviors are far too common among trainees. Punishments and honor codes do little to reduce academic dishonesty in medical education. Responses to unethical acts have also been hampered by divergent opinions about the severity of specific violations and appropriate punishments. However, peer behavior has a strong impact on ethical decisions. The image of dermatology residents writing down test questions together in a restaurant suggests this has become an established norm. Trainees find it more acceptable to engage in unethical conduct when their friends are as well. The best way to limit unethical behavior is to embed academic honesty into institutional cultures, perhaps through role models and curricula that emphasize the respect that a virtuous professional may earn. Case-based ethics training may improve moral reasoning, although the impact on conduct is unknown. Examination content must be highly relevant for the patient-care activities that will be endorsed. Esoteric questions suggestive of academic hazing should be eliminated. Not reusing test questions would reduce the incentive to reproduce questions in verbatim form, but might jeopardize the consistency of passing standards, while increasing expenses. In the end, successful certification must demonstrate that physicians are vested with the trust of both their peers and the public. Sponsoring rigorous examinations that cover material critical for patient care will bolster what the profession provides patients. Ultimately, the integrity of the medical profession and the faith that patients place in physicians demand the highest moral standards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Ruhnke.

They are keen on meeting the target of becoming an integrated member of the EU by the year 2007. The process of joining the EU involves a series of important steps. These include adopting and implementing the EU's body of legislation, known as the acquis communautaire, as well as demonstrating the necessary administrative capacity to enforce these laws and regulations. In addition to this, prospective member states must ensure that they have stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. They must also possess a functioning market economy capable of coping with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU. Romanian officials are confident that their country can successfully meet all these criteria and complete the required preparations. This confidence is fueled by the significant progress Romania has made since its accession negotiations began. The country has managed to adopt many necessary legal reforms, modernize its infrastructure, and strengthen its economy. Furthermore, Romanian authorities have worked diligently to enhance the capacity of their institutions and administrative bodies in order to effectively enforce EU legislation. It should be noted that the target date of 2007 is significant because it is the same year that Bulgaria, another Eastern European country, successfully joined the EU.

Eugene Louis Vidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895-1969) and Nina S. Gore (1903-1978). Vidal was born at the West Point cadet hospital because his first lieutenant father was the first aeronautics instructor of the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, \\"who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther\\". In the memoir Palimpsest (1995), Vidal said, \\"My birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening [in 1939]; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.\\" In the multi-volume memoir The Diary of Anais Nin (1931-74), Anais Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir Palimpsest (1995). Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with the actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. Yet, regarding Nin, in the online article \\"Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anais Nin\\" (2013), author Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching Mirages, the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Moreover, he was briefly engaged to the actress Joanne Woodward before she married the actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles. In 1950, Gore Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his partner for the next 53 years. He said that the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other, \\"It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.\\" In Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself \\"gay\\" because he was not an adjective, adding \\"to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim... . I've said - a thousand times? - in print and on TV, that everyone is bisexual\\". In an interview with Esquire in 1969, Gore said \\"Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word natural, not normal.\\" Commenting his life's work and his life, he described his style as \\"Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\\" In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail with age, he sold his Italian villa La Rondinaia (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to Los Angeles. Howard Austen died in November 2003 and in February 2005 his mortal remains were re-buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot that Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen.","completion":"This text is about a man named Eugene Louis Vidal, who is better known as Gore Vidal.

He wants the name of Jack Beauregard to become a true legend, written down in the history books, and for this purpose he has dreamed up a conflict of truly epic proportions: pitting Jack alone against the 150-man-strong bandit gang, called \\"The Wild Bunch\\".Unable to believe that Nobody could be serious, Jack initially views Nobody as yet another rival gunman, who is just out to make a name for himself by killing Jack - but Nobody is indeed quite serious about his plan.The potential for such a conflict exists because of one Mr. Sullivan (Jean Martin), the owner of a worthless mine, through which the Wild Bunch is laundering stolen gold. Jack Beauregard's brother, called the Nevada Kid, used to be co-owner of the mine, until Sullivan killed him. Now Nobody is hoping that Jack will take revenge upon Sullivan, thereby earning the ire of the Wild Bunch.Sullivan himself expects Jack to come gunning for him as well and has already sent goons after Jack to kill him, on previous occasions. Those were foiled by Jack himself on one occasion and by Nobody on another.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected.
