Definition: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. Input: Gene expression signatures can provide an unbiased view into the molecular changes underlying biologically and medically interesting phenotypes. We therefore initiated this study to identify signatures that would be of utility in studying rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 30 RA patients to assess the effect of different biologic agent (biologics) treatments and to quantify the degree of a type-I interferon (IFN) signature in these patients. A numeric score was derived for the quantification step and applied to patients with RA. To further characterize the IFN response in our cohort, we employed type-I IFN treatment of PBMCs in vitro and in reporter assays. Profiling identified a subset of RA patients with upregulation of type-I IFN-regulated transcripts, thereby corroborating previous reports showing RA to be heterogeneous for an IFN component. A comparison of individuals currently untreated with a biologic with those treated with infliximab, tocilizumab, or abatacept suggested that each biologic induces a specific gene signature in PBMCs. It is possible to observe signs of type-I IFN pathway activation in a subset of clinically active RA patients without C-reactive protein elevation. Furthermore, biologics-specific gene signatures in patients with RA indicate that looking for a biologic-specific response pattern may be a potential future tool for predicting individual patient response.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Here are possible answers to this question: - relaxation - enjoying - arguments - going abroad - spending money I believe the correct choice is \\"arguments\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Arguments are the most likely outcome when a couple disagrees on aspects of planning a vacation, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, planning a vacation is an important decision as it involves a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources. Couples usually have high expectations for this experience, which can lead to conflict when both parties cannot agree on certain aspects. The anticipation and excitement of going on a vacation can heighten emotions, causing disagreements to escalate into arguments more easily. Secondly, vacations often require joint decision-making and compromise, which can be difficult for couples who have different preferences and priorities. Finding a balance that satisfies the needs and desires of both individuals can be challenging, leading to arguments as they navigate accommodations, activities, budget, and more. For instance, one partner may prioritize relaxation and prefer a beach getaway, while the other may be looking for a more adventurous vacation that involves hiking and exploring. Additionally, one person may put more emphasis on luxurious accommodations, while the other may prioritize experiences and allocate more resources towards excursions and activities. These differences in preference can result in tension and disagreement if both parties cannot find common ground. Financial considerations can also contribute to arguments, as a vacation often involves significant expenditure. Money can be a sensitive subject for many couples, and disagreements about budgets and financial priorities are not uncommon. Moreover, when one partner wants to splurge on an expensive destination or activity, the other may feel the need to cut back on expenses elsewhere, causing frustration and potential arguments. Furthermore, many couples face the added challenge of coordinating their schedules and aligning their time off from work or other commitments. This can lead to disagreements about the ideal duration, timing, or destination for their vacation. For example, one partner may prefer a shorter, more action-packed vacation, while the other is looking forward to a longer, leisurely break. In summary, the process of planning a vacation can lead to arguments between a couple when they disagree due to the importance of the experience, differing preferences and priorities, financial considerations, and logistical challenges. It is important for couples to communicate, listen to each other, and be willing to compromise in order to plan a vacation that caters to the needs and desires of both individuals, ultimately resulting in a positive outcome like relaxation and enjoyment, rather than conflict and stress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss... Answer:","completion":"Based on the movie plot provided, a potential question for discussion or analysis could be: How does the unique setting and circumstances within the European village bring out the different personalities and motivations of the characters, ultimately leading them to uncover a hidden mystery while dealing with their own personal dilemmas? This question encourages an in-depth exploration of the movie's setting and its impact on the development of the characters and the story. The plot takes place in a small mountain village, isolating a group of diverse travelers that are forced to mingle and stay overnight in a quaint hotel, bringing out various interpersonal conflicts and secret affairs. By centering the narrative around the avalanche that has thwarted their travel plans, the plot essentially puts the characters in a confined space, allowing for their various personalities to clash and interact in interesting ways. For instance, the urgency of Caldicott and Charters to reach the cricket Test match in England demonstrates their priorities, and their willingness to stay in the maid's room indicates a sense of adaptability and compromise. The unfolding dynamics between Iris, Gilbert, and Miss Froy set the stage for an intriguing relationship as they go from simply trying to get a good night's sleep to helping each other uncover the mysterious events surrounding the musician's murder and the potential target on Miss Froy. The secretive couple, Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter, serve as yet another example of the complexities that emerge within the movie's plot, brought to light by the confinement of their circumstances. Their illicit affair contrasts with the other characters' situations, introducing an element of deception and moral ambiguity within the story. In conclusion, the unique setting and circumstances presented in the movie plot not only allow the characters to face their own personal dilemmas but also force them into a mysterious investigation. This question encourages a deep dive into the ways in which the plot's confined environment pushes the narrative forward and highlights the distinct personalities, motivations, and relationships among the diverse characters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","completion":"In case B, the bacteria are less likely to have a genetic disorder. In this case, the bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics, which is an example of a beneficial mutation. This mutation helps the bacteria survive in their environment and increases their chances of thriving under antibiotic pressure. As a result, the bacteria in case B are more likely to have a healthy, functional protein that contributes to their successful adaptation and survival. In contrast, case C involves bacteria that do not develop any immunity to antibiotics and ultimately perish. The lack of resistance may indicate that these bacteria possess harmful mutations or are simply not adapting well to their environment. Such mutations could potentially cause genetic disorders or a compromised ability to perform necessary functions for survival. So, between case B and case C, case B is less likely to have a genetic disorder, as it demonstrates a beneficial mutation that supports its survival and adaptation to its environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why the other options are not correct: - Badminton World Federation emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is not relevant to the passage, as it states that the BWF emerged as a force in the sport rather than focus on the impact of the scandal on China or the athlete. - CNN emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is not related to the topic of the passage. CNN is a news organization, not a player in the sport of badminton. - Farewell Badminton World Federation emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement doesn't make any sense, as it mixes a quote from the passage with the phrasing of the option. - Olympic emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is vague and unrelated to the passage. The term \\"Olympic\\" does not clearly identify an entity or a team within the sport of badminton. - Wang Xiaoli emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it suggests Wang Xiaoli, Yu Yang's partner, was a prominent player in the 1970s, which is not relevant to the passage or the situation being discussed. - Yu emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it refers to Yu Yang, who was not a player in the 1970s, and it is unrelated to the main topic of the passage. - Yu Yang emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the badminton field in the 1970s: This statement is incorrect, as it suggests Yu Yang was a prominent player in the 1970s, which is not relevant to the passage or time frame being discussed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

How is \\"Don’t touch me, not ever And then you will win!\\" said in French?","completion":"In French, the phrase \\"Don't touch me, not ever, and then you will win!\\" can be translated as \\"Ne me touche pas, jamais, et alors tu gagneras !\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of each part of the sentence: 1. \\"Don't touch me\\" - In French, the negation structure consists of \\"ne\\" placed in front of the verb and \\"pas\\" placed after the verb. In this case, the verb \\"toucher\\" (to touch) is combined with the pronoun \\"me\\" (me). The imperative form (command form) of the verb toucher, for the singular informal \\"you\\" (tu) would be \\"touche.\\" So, the negation \\"Don't touch me\\" becomes \\"Ne me touche pas.\\" 2. \\"Not ever\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"jamais\\" in French. It is an adverb that means \\"never\\" or \\"not ever\\" and can be used here to reinforce the idea that the speaker does not want to be touched at all. 3. \\"And then\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"et alors.\\" \\"Et\\" means \\"and,\\" while \\"alors\\" is an adverb meaning \\"then\\" or \\"so.\\" This part of the sentence is used to connect the first two phrases with the last one, implying a cause-and-effect relationship. 4. \\"You will win\\" - In French, \\"you will win\\" can be translated as \\"tu gagneras.\\" \\"Gagner\\" means \\"to win\\" and is conjugated here in the future tense for the singular informal \\"you\\" (tu). The future tense of the verb \\"gagner\\" for the subject \\"tu\\" would be \\"gagneras.\\" Putting all these parts together, the French translation of \\"Don't touch me, not ever, and then you will win!\\" is \\"Ne me touche pas, jamais, et alors tu gagneras !\\""},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Formerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.

Answer the above question based on the context below: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Please answer the following question: Background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Paragraph: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.

Can you fix that?","completion":"The book is written as a diary but jumps very from person to person. The unique format of the book, which is written as a diary, makes it an engaging and immersive read for the audience. However, it also has a fascinating twist in that it jumps from one person's perspective to another, effectively allowing readers to get to know the characters on a deeper level. This approach can be highly beneficial for the storytelling process, as it enables the author to provide different points of view on specific events and situations. By presenting various perspectives, the readers can piece together a more comprehensive picture of what is happening within the storyline, and ultimately form a richer understanding of the characters' emotions, motivations, and experiences. Additionally, the diary-like structure itself lends a certain sense of intimacy to the narrative. As readers peruse the personal thoughts and feelings of each character, they forge a connection with them. This close association makes it easier to relate to the characters and become invested in their journey. Despite the potential advantages, there are also challenges that come with writing a book in this format. The frequent jumps between characters can make it difficult for readers to follow the narrative if the transitions are not seamless. It is essential for the author to establish a clear distinction between the different perspectives to avoid confusion. One way to address this challenge is by writing each character's diary entries in a unique voice or style. This differentiation helps the readers easily identify the character behind each entry, fostering an uninterrupted flow of the narrative. Incorporating elements like date and time stamps or distinct chapter headings can also contribute to a smoother reading experience. Subtle visual cues, such as different fonts or formatting for each character, can offer additional clarity. Moreover, writing from multiple points of view requires a thorough understanding of each character, their background, and their thought processes. The author must ensure that the characters' voices remain consistent and authentic. Developing well-rounded and believable characters can also help readers remain engaged and interested in their story. In conclusion, while writing a book as a diary that jumps from one person to another can present certain challenges, it also holds immense potential to deliver an engaging and intimate reading experience. By carefully handling transitions, playing with narrative styles, and creating well-developed characters, an author can successfully write a compelling multi-perspective story that connects with readers on a deeper level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Before my first summer vacation at college, my roommate Ted asked to me to work with him on his father's farm in Argentina. The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed. At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Second question: Why is no one answering my questions in Quora? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both the first and the second questions are essentially asking the same thing - why one's questions on Quora are not receiving any answers. There could be several reasons for this issue, and it is important to consider various factors that might be contributing to it. Here are some possible explanations: 1. Poorly formulated questions: It is crucial to ask clear, well-formulated, and easy-to-understand questions for people to respond to. If your question is lengthy, confusing, or ambiguous, potential answerers might find it challenging to comprehend and be discouraged from responding. 2. Lack of proper tagging and categorization: Quora relies heavily on tags and topic organization to direct questions to the relevant audience. When your question lacks appropriate tags or is miscategorized, it may not reach the right experts or users interested in the subject matter, resulting in fewer or no answers. 3. Oversaturated topics or duplicate questions: Quora has been around for several years and has accumulated millions of questions and answers. If your question has been asked numerous times before or is very similar to existing questions, it might be overlooked by users who assume it has already been answered. In such cases, it is recommended to search for existing answers before posting a new question. 4. Timing and visibility: The time of day or week when a question is posted may affect its visibility to potential answerers. Posting during peak user activity hours or when your target audience is predominantly online improves the chances of receiving more responses. 5. Niche or overly specific topics: While Quora covers a wide array of subjects, some questions may be too niche or specific, limiting their potential answerers. In such cases, it might be difficult to find someone with the knowledge or experience necessary to provide a satisfactory answer. 6. Unfavorable Quora algorithm: Quora's algorithm plays a significant role in deciding which questions get promoted on users' feeds and which ones remain buried. The algorithm considers factors like the number of upvotes, shares, and answers a question receives. If your question receives low engagement initially, the algorithm might not prioritize it, making it less likely to be seen and answered. 7. Inadequate engagement from your Quora network: As part of the Quora community, having a strong network of followers and connections can help increase the visibility of your questions. Engaging actively in answering, following, and upvoting other users' content on the platform generates reciprocal interest from community members and improves the chances of getting your questions answered. While it is possible that a combination of these factors might be contributing to the lack of answers for your questions on Quora, identifying and addressing these issues will likely increase your chances of receiving responses in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train. Serling tracks down Ilario using details about Ilario's preferred vacation spot. Ilario tells the true story, revealing that Monfriez wanted to flee while leaving Rady behind.

Information: - The Scottish Football League (SFL) was a league featuring professional and semi-professional football clubs mostly from Scotland. From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL represented the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Ayrshire is a historic county in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde. It is also, under the name the County of Ayr, a registration county. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800. - The Old Firm is the collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, who are both based in Glasgow. The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as \\"like two old, firm friends\\", and represents the commercial benefits of the two clubs' rivalry. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original 11 members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890. The rivalry between the two clubs has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture and has contributed to the political, social and religious division in Scotland and also beyond, especially in neighbouring Northern Ireland. As a result, the fixture was recognised as having enduring appeal. - The Scottish Junior Football Association (\\"SJFA\\" for short) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term \\"junior\\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that non-league football in Scotland is not similarly integrated into its football league system. Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by three regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland's national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 188081 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season. - The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship. - Robert Stevenson \`\` Bobby '' Donnelly ( born 19 January 1987 ) is a Scottish professional footballer currently playing as a defender for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the Scottish Junior Football Association , West Region . He has previously played in the Scottish Premier League for Motherwell . - Girvan (\\"mouth of the River Girvan\\") is a burgh in Carrick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Girvan is stituated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland. - South Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland, covering the southern part of Ayrshire. It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. South Ayrshire Council is a Conservative controlled council. The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington - located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick - being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the Firth of Clyde. - The Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region is one of three regions of the SJFA which organise their own distinct league and cup competitions. The SJFA used to be split into six regions, but in 2002 they took the decision to reform into three to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues.

Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Question: suppose the wood is sealed happens, how will it affect the rain will not evaporate out of the wood. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"The process described earlier involves the rain affecting an unsealed wooden surface, causing it to lose its finish and luster over time. However, if the wood is properly sealed, the effects of rain on the wood change significantly. To analyze how this perturbation affects the second effect mentioned, we need to understand the role of a sealant in protecting wooden surfaces. A sealant acts as a barrier between the wooden surface and the external elements, in this case, rainwater. It prevents the rain from seeping into the wood surface, essentially creating a protective coat that maintains the appearance and structural properties of the wood. Here are the influences of a sealed wooden surface in relation to the original process: 1. Rain falls on the sealed wood: Since the wood is sealed, the rain cannot penetrate the surface. The sealant acts as a barrier, shielding the wood from the moisture and potential water damage. 2. The rain does not seep into the wood surface: As the wood is sealed, rainwater cannot infiltrate and permeate the wood, so it remains on the surface. Consequently, no damage is caused to the wood's integrity or appearance. 3. Rain does not permeate the wood: The sealant's effectiveness in blocking the rain from entering the wood preserves the material's luster, color, and finish, extending its life over time. 4. When the rain evaporates, it doesn't affect the wood: Since the rain does not come into contact with the wood beneath the sealant, any evaporation of rainwater does not harm the wooden surface or its finish. So, when examining the supposed perturbation – sealing the wood – and its influence on the second effect mentioned – rain evaporation taking the finish of the wood with it – the sealing of the wood has a significant effect: it greatly reduces or eliminates the damage caused by rain to the wooden surface. In other words, the sealed wood is less affected by rain, evaporation, and potential damage than an unsealed surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The statement mentions these websites shutting down, or providing links for earthquake donations, but it does not directly address the initial question about websites converting their home page colors. Regarding the question, many websites have been known to change their home page colors for various reasons, such as supporting social causes, raising awareness, or celebrating special events. Here is a more detailed answer: 1. Social causes or awareness campaigns: Websites often update their home page colors to support various social causes, like World AIDS Day, Earth Day, or cancer awareness. For example, sites might change their home page colors to red during World AIDS Day or pink during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This action generates visibility and solidarity towards specific issues and helps in raising awareness. 2. Tragedy or disaster events: Many websites have altered their color schemes, or converted their homepages to black, in response to tragic events such as terror attacks, natural disasters, or to pay respect to the deceased in memorial events. For instance, in April 2011, Chinese websites turned their home pages black to mourn the victims of the Qinghai earthquake. 3. Celebratory instances: Many websites change their home page colors to celebrate special events or occasions, such as holidays, product launches, or significant milestones. For example, during LGBTQ+ pride month, several websites modify their color schemes to incorporate the rainbow flag colors in support of the LGBTQ+ community. 4.

One such example is \\"Blackout Tuesday,\\" where numerous websites and social media platforms turned their pages black in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the death of George Floyd in 2020.

Given the question: This article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music?, what is it ?

Options: a. Light is refracted by water vapor in the air.. b. Light is scattered by water droplets in the air.. c. Light is absorbed by water vapor near the ground.. d. Light is reflected by water droplets on the ground.. Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is: b. Light is scattered by water droplets in the air. Step 1: Analyze the options a. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes through media with different refractive indices, like from air to water, but it doesn't significantly reduce visibility. b. Scattering is the process where light is diffused or deflected in various directions due to interaction with particles, like water droplets in fog. c. Absorption is when light is taken in by a substance and converted into other forms of energy, like heat. While water vapor can absorb some light, it is not enough to cause the dramatic reduction in visibility in heavy fog. d. Reflection is when light bounces off a surface or object. While some light may be reflected by water droplets on the ground, it is not the primary reason for reduced visibility in heavy fog. Step 2: Justify the correct option Option b is correct because heavy fog is made up of tiny water droplets suspended in the air. When light passes through these water droplets, it is scattered in various directions, preventing the light from traveling directly from its source to the observer.

There is no mention of any efforts towards soil improvement or conservation practices that might have resulted in cleaner water. 2. Fruit farm had depleted soils in the past, but they established an agroforestry system a decade ago. This helped stabilize the soil and increase production. Agroforestry systems are known for various environmental benefits, including cleaner water due to reduced soil erosion and better filtration. Given this information, I can conclude the following: A: Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods, as there is no mention of any efforts towards soil improvement or conservation practices. On the other hand, Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system, which likely resulted in cleaner water due to its environmental benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more food is in the body happens, how will it affect the liver turns more glucagon into glucose. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the original process The original process involves the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. When blood sugar levels drop, the pancreas releases glucagon, the liver converts glucagon into glucose, and releases it back into the bloodstream, restoring blood sugar levels. Step 2: Introduce the perturbation The perturbation in this case is the introduction of more food into the body. Step 3: Determine the direct effects of the perturbation When more food is introduced in the body, it will be digested and absorbed, leading to an increase in blood sugar levels. Step 4: Analyze the effect of perturbation on the original process Given that the blood sugar levels have increased due to the introduction of more food, the body's need to raise blood sugar levels by releasing glucagon from the pancreas and converting it into glucose in the liver may be reduced or eliminated. Step 5: Evaluate the indirect effects of the perturbation (if any) As a result of the increased blood sugar levels, the body may secrete more insulin to help the cells absorb the glucose and maintain optimal blood sugar levels. This could result in a decrease in the release of glucagon from the pancreas, potentially impacting the liver's need to convert glucagon into glucose. Step 6: Assess the overall effect of the perturbation on the process In conclusion, the perturbation of more food in the body might have both direct and indirect effects on the process. The direct effect is the reduction or elimination of the need to convert glucagon into glucose in the liver due to increased blood sugar levels. The indirect effect is a potential decrease in the release of glucagon from the pancreas as the body secretes more insulin to maintain blood sugar levels. Overall, these effects could lead to the liver converting less glucagon into glucose as the perturbation occurs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The SHARP 19SC111 television was a television which included a built-in Famicom.

Please answer this question: The 1954 film Demetrius And The Gladiators was the sequel to which film of 1953 ?","completion":"The 1954 film \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\" was the sequel to the 1953 film \\"The Robe.\\" This epic, historical drama directed by Henry Koster was based on a novel of the same name by Lloyd C. Douglas and produced by 20th Century Fox. Both films were significant for their time, with \\"The Robe\\" being the first film released in the widescreen, CinemaScope format. This new format gave audiences a more immersive experience, with a wider aspect ratio that provided a panoramic view of the scenes. \\"The Robe\\" tells the story of a Roman tribune, Marcellus Gallio, played by Richard Burton. He is involved in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and wins Christ's robe as a gambling prize. The relic becomes a source of turmoil for him as he starts experiencing guilt, nightmares, and spiritual awakening. Marcellus eventually becomes a Christian, as does his slave, Demetrius (played by Victor Mature), who plays a crucial role in the sequel \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators.\\" In \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators,\\" the story picks up where \\"The Robe\\" left off. Following the events of the first movie, Demetrius is entrusted with the robe of Christ by Marcellus. The film revolves around Demetrius' struggles to protect the sacred relic while navigating the dangerous world of gladiators, Roman politics, and religious persecution. Directed by Delmer Daves, the film primarily takes place in Rome and focuses on the political conflict between Emperor Caligula (played by Jay Robinson) and Claudius Caesar (played by Barry Jones). The film also stars actress Susan Hayward as Messalina, the wife of Claudius and a woman who becomes infatuated with Demetrius, adding another layer of complication to the story. As Demetrius tries to keep the robe away from the grasp of the corrupt and power-hungry, he faces many challenges, including imprisonment and being forced to become a gladiator. The movie not only focuses on Demetrius' physical battles but also explores his internal struggles with faith, love, and duty. \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\" capitalized on the success and popularity of \\"The Robe,\\" with its captivating story, notable performances, and epic action sequences. The two films remain iconic representations of the biblical epic genre that was prominent in the 1950s and 1960s. They were also significant in showcasing the ancient Roman world and exploring themes of religious faith, redemption, and political intrigue, which were appealing to the audience during that era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators? Answer:","completion":"Hannah and Joe, both studying horticulture, were exploring the behavior and relationships of ants for their entomology class. While Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, Joe focused on ants that farm fungus. In order to determine which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators, we need to take a deeper look at the two types of ants being studied by each of them. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids. These ants, known as aphid-herding ants, maintain a symbiotic relationship with the aphids. Aphids feed on plant sap and excrete a sugary substance called honeydew, which the ants consume as a food source. In return, the ants protect the aphids from predators such as ladybugs and lacewings. As an important part of their survival strategy, these ants have developed various defense mechanisms to ward off aphid predators. They fight by physically attacking predators, as well as releasing various chemical signals to alert their colony members of potential threats. On the other hand, Joe studied ants that farm fungus, also known as leaf-cutter ants. These ants display an entirely different behavior. Leaf-cutter ants cut small pieces of leaves and carry them back to their nest, where they use the leaves to cultivate fungus gardens. They rely on this fungus as their primary food source. For leaf-cutter ants, their primary focus is on maintaining the fungus garden, and they have significantly less interaction with aphids and their predators. Although they may occasionally encounter such predators, their main concerns lie in defending their territory, maintaining their fungus garden, and repelling any infection or contamination by foreign elements. Considering the specific ants being studied by both Hannah and Joe, it is clear that Joe learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators. Since the primary interest of leaf-cutter ants lies in their fungus gardens, they do not have the same level of interaction and defense mechanisms against aphid predators as do the aphid-herding ants. Furthermore, aphid predators such as ladybugs and lacewings are not directly relevant to the leaf-cutter ants' primary concerns. Therefore, Joe, who studied ants that farm fungus, learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators compared to Hannah, who studied ants with a symbiotic relationship directly linked to the protection of aphids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who sailed back east along the coast to Honduras? is inside the article: Gil González Dávila set out from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the intention of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: It all begins one snowy evening shortly before Christmas, 1933, but no one is feeling very festive at the Girls' Annex of The New York City Municipal Orphanage.11-year old Annie (Alicia Morton, in her film debut, after launching her professional life on Broadway) is gazing out a window at the falling flakes when the silence is pierced by the cries of little Molly (Sarah Hyland), calling for her vanished mother. Pepper (Marissa Rago) angrily erupts over being awakened, but July (Nanea Miyata) jumps to Molly's defense. Annie breaks up the scuffle, and comforts Molly by telling her she was just having another nightmare. Molly admits that he misses her parents terribly, but Pepper, apparently believing that heavy armor is the surest defense, curtly reminds her that they are orphans, that they neither have, nor ever will have, parents. Annie retorts that she is not an orphan - that her parents are alive and are coming back for her, and Molly chirps triumphantly that Annie has a note to prove it. Molly asks Annie to read the note aloud once more, something Annie has done so often that the other girls know its contents quite well:\\"Please take care of our little darling. Her name is Annie.

Movie title: Yellow Submarine Context: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine.

When Sue Walters was diagnosed with leukaemia, she hoped that the best of medical science would be used to cure it. What she could never have anticipated was that her life would be saved by an 18-year-old boy from a remote German village. Sue’s only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant — previously known as a bone marrow transplant. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life. If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months,' said Sue Walters of her donor Nicola Gerber. This would give her a new, stronger immune system to destroy the cancerous cells in her blood. No one in her family matched her tissue type, so doctors searched the worldwide donor register — and found Nicola Gerber, a student from Mechern, near the French border. He had recently registered as a stem cell donor, and was the perfect match. Thanks to Nicola, Sue has made a full recovery. The two began writing to each other a year after the transplant and recently met for the first time when Nicola flew from Germany to see Sue. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life,’ says Sue, who broke down in tears when he walked into the room. ‘If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months.’ Sue’s husband Humphrey, her son Mark and daughter-in-law Maria were all there to show their enormous gratitude. ‘What’s remarkable is for a young guy like this to have the social awareness to do something like that,’ says Humphrey. For Nicola the reward is seeing Sue in good health. ‘She looks so well and so happy,’ he says. ‘It’s a good feeling.’ The story behind his decision to donate is extraordinary. In 2011, a man in his village was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed a stem cell transplant. ‘Half the village — about 300 people — got checked to see if they were a match and one was found,’ says Nicola, now 21 and studying engineering. ‘I registered and though I wasn’t a match, three months later I got a letter saying there was another person who needed my cells. ‘I was told it was a lady from England. I was happy to help,’ he says. Sue, 74, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) — aggressive cancer of the white blood cells — in July 2011 after a blood test showed up abnormalities. About 2,600 people in Britain are diagnosed with this form of leukaemia each year. It’s most common in the over 60s. ‘She looks so well and so happy. It’s a good feeling,' said Nicola. ‘The diagnosis was a huge shock,’ says Sue, who lives in West London and has two children, Claudia and Mark, and three grandchildren. ‘I wanted to know if I was going to die and my doctor said: “Do not go and Google this.” To this day I have never looked.’ She adds: ‘Initially, I did cry, but soon I thought: “I’ve got to get a grip on this.” I never asked about my prognosis. I had complete confidence in the wonderful doctors and nurses. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was.’ Sue began two courses of chemotherapy, each involving a five-week hospital stay. Her doctor explained that while they could control her cancer with chemotherapy, the only cure was the transplant. Stem cells are ‘master’ cells that can develop into a variety of different cells — those in the bone marrow turn into blood cells. These play a crucial role in the immune system, and in leukaemia, all these cells become abnormal, says Dr Mike Potter, consultant haematologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital and the London Clinic, who treated Sue. ‘Chemotherapy can reduce the cancer, but it can’t destroy it completely. In a stem cell transplant, cells travel to the centre of the bones and start making new blood cells able to fight the cancer that’s left over from the chemo.’ Essentially, the patient’s blood and immune system is replaced by the donor’s. During Sue’s second course of chemotherapy, she was told a donor had been found. ‘I was just told it was a young German boy of 18 and that was a bit of a strange thought,’ says Sue, who works for her husband, a motivational speaker and performance coach in business and sport. About 2,000 people in Britain need a stem cell transplant for leukaemia and lymphoma — cancers of the blood — and other blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia. Often, it is their last hope of survival. Patients can receive a stem cell transplant only from someone who matches their tissue type or else the body rejects it, says Dr Potter. ‘There are 22 million volunteers in the world and, for every patient, there are usually just one or two donors who match and sometimes none,’ he says. Around a million Britons are registered as stem cell donors, but there’s a desperate need for more. Only 60 per cent of patients in need of a transplant find the best possible match, according to the charity Anthony Nolan. There is a particular shortage of young, male donors and those of ethnic minority. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was,’ said Sue. It’s possible to perform a stem cell transplant using a donor who is a less-than-perfect match, but the risks of rejection are higher. Stem cells used to be collected via a needle into the bone marrow, an operation involving a general anaesthetic, which caused considerable pain for days afterwards. Now they can be taken from the blood without an anaesthetic. Before donating his cells Nicola had to inject himself in the stomach twice a day for three days with a drug that stimulates stem cells to come out from the bone marrow and into the blood. ‘It didn’t hurt, but it’s uncomfortable when you feel the stem cells coming out — like a pressure in my chest and back,’ he says. He then travelled to a hospital in Frankfurt to have cells harvested during a three-hour procedure. Blood was removed via a tube into his arm and into a machine, which removed the stem cells before the blood was returned to a tube in his other arm. About ten to 15 litres of blood were removed, then returned. Nicola says it was painless, and while some donors feel very tired afterwards, he felt fine. His cells were flown straight to London — the transplant must be done within 48 hours as the cells have a lifespan of only 72 hours. Sue was prepared with high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system so her body would accept the new cells. Though her donor was a perfect match, the transplant still carried a 20 per cent risk of her dying, due to infection or rejection of the cells. The transplant on November 25, 2011 was just like a blood trans-fusion, says Sue. ‘I did have terrible pain in my back for about a week after, which I was told was my body fighting the new stem cells.’ It takes three weeks for the donor immune system to start working, and with her own immune system in decline, Sue was kept in hospital. 'She was discharged on Christmas Eve, feeling ‘very weak’. Gradually, her new immune system started to fight the leukaemia. By the summer, Sue’s strength had returned and she now feels extremely well. It’s not until after five years that you can say someone is ‘cured’ — but at three years, Sue is ‘in a very good position’, says Dr Potter. She still takes antiviral and antibiotic drugs as a precaution. A year after the transplant, she received a letter through the London Clinic from Nicola, though their names couldn’t be revealed to each other until two years had passed (to avoid distress for the donor and recipient). ‘It was a very sweet letter,’ she says. ‘He just said: “I’m really glad to help you.” ’ They exchanged Christmas cards and then decided to meet. ‘I’d wanted to know where my stem cells had gone,’ says Nicola. ‘I wanted to know if it worked.’ He says the decision to donate was a simple one. ‘If you have the chance to help someone, you should do it,’ he says.

Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","completion":"Adult albatrosses can lose 2.9 ounces a day of weight from their body weight during the process of incubation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues. and the situation: Scientists studied two island. One with an old ecosystem named Old island, and the other with a newly formed and forming ecosystem named New island. Both islands were inhabited, Old island being heavily inhabited. Answer the following question: Which island had a more favorable amount of rainfall for new ecosystems? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned which island - Old or New island - has a more favorable amount of rainfall for new ecosystems.

Article: In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine. Robert Farra says, \\"The new version may take us two years, and then we may be required to do two additional trials, taking about four years before the device is available on the commercial scale.\\" Question: Which is NOT the advantage of the device? - It can release exact amount of medicine. - It can free patients the pain and stress of injections. - it held only twenty doses of medicine. - It is as effective as daily injections.

He then grabs a nearby rod that is positively charged and moves it near the knob of the electroscope. Fascinated he sees the leaves of the electroscope move apart from each other. and a hint : Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge. Please answer this question : Given the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, would the electroscope have a positive or negative charge? A:","completion":"If the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, the electroscope would have a negative charge. The reason for this is that a negatively charged rod, when brought close to the neutral electroscope, will repel electrons away from the knob and down to the leaves, due to the like charges repelling each other. When the negatively charged rod is touching the knob, electrons from the rod will transfer to the electroscope, as objects with opposite or different amounts of charge will try to reach an equilibrium state by sharing charges. In this case, since the rod has an excess of electrons (negative charge), it will transfer some electrons to the electroscope. When the negatively charged rod is removed from the electroscope, the transferred electrons will remain in the electroscope, leading to an excess of electrons and resulting in the electroscope having a negative charge.

He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a supposed bogeyman lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the bogeyman and tears off back down the stairs. At a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally lets some animals loose, and the new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behaviour, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery. Given the silent treatment by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and confidant, and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ. The monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino. One day, the statue notices that Marcelino is pensive and brooding instead of happy, and tells him that he would like to reward his kindness.

Question: Information: - The River Severn (Welsh: \\"Afon Hafren\\", Latin: \\"Sabrina\\") is the longest river in the United Kingdom, at about . It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales. - Shrewsbury (or ) is the county town of Shropshire, England. It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72,000. - Aston Pigott is a hamlet approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury within the parish of Worthen and Shelve . The current population stands at around 50 . The hamlet is situated on a small rise giving many of the properties an outstanding view across the Rea Brook valley to the Stiperstones . It contains three working farms that are mainly dairy and lamb farms . The hamlet is served primarily by Worthen which is 1 mile to the west . It adjoins Aston Rogers . The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name . Mains water arrived in 1947 and mains electricity in 1948 . - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales. It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain. - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill. Stiperstones' summit ridge is crowned by several rugged, jagged outcrops of rock silhouetted against the sky.

Brand management: Dr Pepper Ten is a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign. Dudes don't drink diet. Or at least that's the idea behind Dr Pepper Ten, a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign that proclaims ‘It's not for women.’ The soft drink was developed after the company's research found that men shy away from diet drinks that aren't perceived as ‘manly’ enough. To appeal to men, Dr Pepper made its Ten drink 180 degrees different than Diet Dr Pepper. It has calories and sugar unlike its diet counterpart. Instead of the dainty tan bubbles on the diet can, Ten will be wrapped in gunmetal grey packaging with silver bullets. And while Diet Dr Pepper's marketing is women-friendly, the ad campaign for Ten goes out of its way to eschew women. For instance, there's a Dr Pepper Ten Facebook page for men only. And TV commercials are heavy on the machismo, including one spot that shows muscular men in the jungle battling snakes and bad guys and appear to shoot lasers at each other. ‘Hey ladies. Enjoying the film? Of course not. Because this is our movie and this is our soda,’ a man says as he attempts to pour the soda into a glass during a bumpy ATV ride. ‘You can keep the romantic comedies and lady drinks. We're good.’ Dr Pepper Ten is not the first diet soda aimed at men. (Think: Coke Zero and Pepsi Max.) But it’s the first ad campaign to be so overt about courting men who want to drink a soda with fewer calories. The ads come at a time when overall sales in the 74billon soft drink industry are slowing as more Americans buy healthier options like juice and bottled water. Volume has fallen from slightly over 10 billion cases in 2005 to 9.4 billion cases in 2010, according to Beverage Digest data. ‘Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas,’ said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. Dr Pepper said men, in particular, are dissatisfied with the taste and image of diet drinks. The company wouldn't disclose the formula of Dr Pepper Ten, but said that the drink has 10 calories and 2 grams of sugar, which gives it a sweeter taste. Dr Pepper said there are 23 flavours in. its regular soda, (which has 150 calories and 27 grams of sugar per can) and Dr Pepper Ten contains all of them. Interesting approach: It's not often that a major brand tries to block out an entire segment of the population, but that's exactly what Dr Pepper is doing with the launch of its latest product, Dr Pepper Ten. The company, which declined to give figures for how much was spent on the campaign, also worked hard to craft a macho message. 'One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded. That will always get someone's attention' Deborah MitchellUniversity of Wisconsin. The company said ads for Dr Pepper Ten will air on all major networks, FX and ESPN during college football games. A Facebook page for the drink contains an application that allows it to exclude women from viewing content, which includes games and videos aimed at being ‘manly.’ For instance, there's a shooting gallery where you shoot things like high heels and lipstick. There is also a ‘man quiz’ with questions on activities like fishing and hunting. ‘One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded,’ said brand expert Deborah Mitchell. 'Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas' John SicherBeverage Digest. ‘That will always get someone's attention,’ added Ms Mitchell, executive director for the Center for Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin School of Business. As for whether the ads will resonate with men remains to be seen. Paul McDonald, 25, who works in green energy contracts in Berkley, California, says he drinks soda labelled ‘diet’ and doesn't think there is any stigma attached. ‘No one has ever made fun of me for drinking a Diet Coke, and I'm on a rugby team - we make fun of each other for everything,’ he said. 'Women get the joke. \\"Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product' Jim TrebilcockDr Pepper. And women? Jim Trebilcock, executive vice president of marketing for Dr Pepper, said he's not worried that they'll be offended by the campaign. The drink and marketing were tested in six different markets across the country before being rolled out nationally, and women weren't offended, he said. In fact, about 40 per cent of people who have tried the soda so far are women. ‘Women get the joke,’ he said. ‘“Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product.’ See video here.

The critic consesnsus is: Despite boasting a stellar cast, Fireflies in the Garden is just tedious, dull and predictable melodrama. Instantly forgettable.. What reviews supported this critic consensus?","completion":"The critic consensus on \\"Fireflies in the Garden\\" points to the film's tiresome, monotonous, and predictable nature, despite the presence of an impressive ensemble. A number of notable reviews have shared similar viewpoints, revealing agreement among critics on the film's shortcomings. 1. A.O. Scott of The New York Times: In his review, Scott observes that the film's narrative falls into a predictable pattern and the characters are underdeveloped. According to Scott, the failure to evoke audience empathy is particularly unfortunate given the film's talented ensemble, which ends up being underutilized. 2. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian: Bradshaw offers a critical review of \\"Fireflies in the Garden,\\" comparing it to a soap opera in terms of melodramatic content. He notes that, although the cast is impressive, their performances are stifled by the unrealistic dialogue and disjointed narrative. 3. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times: Ebert's review of the film further reinforces the critic consensus. He acknowledges the potential of the high-caliber cast but states that their talents are wasted on a trite screenplay. Ebert also sees the film's plot as too familiar and offers little to make it stand out from other family dramas. 4. Tim Robey of The Telegraph: Robey's review highlights the miscasting of certain characters as contributing to the film's downfalls. He explains that while the ensemble is strong, the film's writing pales in comparison, resulting in a severe imbalance between the actors' capabilities and the underwhelming material they are given to work with. 5. Claudia Puig of USA Today: Puig criticizes the film's unconvincing family dynamics, remarking that the actors, despite their talent, were unable to rescue the poorly penned and implausible relationships presented in the film. She also notes that the film's predictable storylines do little to leave a lasting impression. 6. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune: Phillips draws attention to the fact that \\"Fireflies in the Garden\\" does not live up to its potential, given its A-list cast. The film is criticized for being underwhelming and unmemorable, largely due to its overemphasis on melodrama and heavy-handed approach to storytelling. In summary, while many critics acknowledged the film's potential due to its outstanding cast, consistent criticisms regarding the lackluster narrative, weak dialogue, and underdeveloped characters have led to the film's widespread dismissal as a forgettable and predictable melodrama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: how does the mls schedule work I found the following answer on Google: The league's closed membership makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues not using promotion and relegation . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not directly explain how the MLS schedule works but rather mentions that the league has a closed membership system without promotion or relegation. Let me explain the MLS schedule for you. Step 1: Understand the structure of MLS Major League Soccer (MLS) is a professional soccer league in the United States and Canada with currently 27 teams (24 from the United States and 3 from Canada). Step 2: Divide the teams into conferences The league is divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Step 3: Regular season schedule Each team plays a total of 34 games during the regular season, which typically starts in late February and ends in October. The schedule includes a mix of both home and away games. Matches are scheduled primarily against teams within their own conference, but also they play few games against teams from the other conference. Step 4: Scheduling considerations MLS aims to minimize travel time between locations for teams, which is why the majority of matches are scheduled within the same conference. Furthermore, the league also considers factors such as stadium availability, team preferences, and potential weather-related issues while creating the schedule. Step 5: Postseason and MLS Cup At the end of the regular season, the top seven teams from each conference qualify for the postseason playoffs, which take place in November and December. The playoff is a knockout-style competition leading to the final match, known as the MLS Cup, where the Eastern Conference Champion and Western Conference Champion play for the league title. In conclusion, the MLS schedule is based on a regular season with 34 games per team followed by playoffs for top teams within each conference and concludes with the MLS Cup to determine the league champion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Randy's health was being examined by Robert because","completion":"Randy had been experiencing a series of unusual symptoms lately. These included persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, frequent episodes of dizziness, and occasional sharp pains in his abdomen. Worried about these symptoms, Randy had approached his close friend, Robert, who happened to be a well-qualified and experienced physician, to help him gain insights into his current health condition. Robert, being a genuine individual, kindly agreed to assess Randy's health without any second thoughts. To begin his examination, Robert asked Randy a series of questions to determine his recent medical history and if any possible genetic factors could be contributing to Randy's symptoms. Randy recalled that his father had undergone bypass surgery a decade ago and his mother, albeit active, was managing her type 2 diabetes with medications. Robert noted this information and proceeded to conduct a series of non-invasive tests in his clinic to get a better understanding of Randy's health. He started with vital sign assessments, such as measuring Randy's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. This was followed by a comprehensive physical examination to check for any abnormalities, carefully evaluating the lymph nodes, the abdomen, the medical eye, ear, and throat regions, and looking for any unusual skin or joint issues. After the basic examinations, Robert obtained a blood sample from Randy to be sent to the laboratory for a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). These tests would allow him to assess Randy's heart health for any signs of anemia, inflammation, and kidney function decline, as well as his glucose levels, electrolyte balance, and liver enzymes. He also ordered a lipid panel that would provide an overview of Randy's cholesterol and triglyceride levels. With the lab results, Robert wanted to ensure he checked for hormonal imbalances and other irregularities, such as hypothyroidism or cortisol deficiencies. So, he asked the lab to perform a thyroid function test and measure Randy's cortisol levels. Robert then assessed Randy's cardiovascular health by conducting a stress test. This involved monitoring Randy's heart rate and blood pressure while he exercised on a treadmill to detect any possible abnormalities in how his heart responded to physical activity. To supplement this, he performed an electrocardiogram (EKG) to ascertain if Randy's heart had any irregular electrical activity or rhythm. As a part of the in-depth examination, Robert also wanted to ensure that Randy's dizziness and balance issues weren't stemming from an inner ear problem. Consequently, he sent Randy to an audiologist for a hearing test and a vestibular assessment. Once Robert had collected all the test results, he went through the data meticulously to understand the root cause of Randy's symptoms. He noticed that the lab data showed Randy had elevated fasting glucose levels and an increased HbA1c, which pointed towards possible prediabetes. Furthermore, his lipid panel suggested borderline high cholesterol levels. In light of these findings, Robert scheduled a follow-up appointment with Randy to discuss the test results and recommend a course of action. He reinforced the importance of a healthy lifestyle, encompassing a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to mitigate the risk of developing full-blown diabetes and cardiovascular issues. He also referred Randy to a nutritionist to help him make informed dietary choices and keep his prediabetic state in check. Throughout the entire process, Robert was extremely professional and compassionate, ensuring Randy's comfort and understanding at every juncture. The thorough examination and guidance provided by Robert was invaluable in helping Randy gain clarity about his health and take proactive steps towards a healthier future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A dilapidated school where pupils were forced to have lessons in the corridor because of the decaying classrooms is still in a state of disrepair one year on. Teachers at Richard Lee Primary School, in Wyken, Coventry, have told how nothing has changed. One one occasion in the last twelve months, a corridor was turned into a river after blocked and cracked storm drains overflowed. Bleak outlook: Pupils Georgia Diston and Harvey Billing have to resort to holding an umbrella at Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry because there are so many leaks in their dilapidated classroom. Disrepair: After class, the two youngsters have to then walk along crumbling corridors, one of which became a river when a cracked storm drain overflowed. And in the last two weeks, six leaks have sprung up in classroom roofs, forcing the children to hold umbrellas during lessons. It all adds to a tale of woe at the 509-pupil school - soon to increase to 700 students in September - that includes crumbling walls, moldy carpets, drafty doors, cracked windows, collapsing roofs and freezing classrooms. When Nick Gibb, minister of state for schools, visited he dubbed the conditions the worst he has ever seen. Mr Gibb added: 'I would be very cross about the standard of the building if I was a parent with children at the school. This is clearly a very poor building that was built in the 1950s and needs work. Patch job: Headteacher Nicola Harwood in one of the out-of-bounds classrooms, which have sprung six leaks in the last two weeks. Expensive: Mrs Harwood looks up at one of the large leaks in the corridor. She believes it will revealed that it would cost upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. The run-down primary school hit the. headlines last year when four and five-year-olds were forced to have. lessons in a corridor after their classroom was flooded by a faulty. boiler. And just five months later part of a roof collapsed - again forcing kids out of their classroom. Pupils,. teachers and parents have since campaigned for a rebuild - even taking. their fight to Downing Street and the Department for Education in July. Their. protests prompted a visit from Mr Gibb yesterday, where the minister. praised staff in keeping teaching standards at the school high, even. when the facilities were not. He. said: 'This is a school focused on making sure that children improve. their reading and arithmetic, despite the problems that they labour. under.' The school is now part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. But headteacher Nicola Harwood said: 'We will have to wait and see if funding materialises. Hopefully our school will be at the top of the list to receive money or a rebuild. Frustrated: Mrs Harwood, pointing out a crack in the food store cupboard, is desperately hoping for funding to materialise before conditions get any worse. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. 'For now we will have to keep patching up the school and continue to make sure Richard Lee is fit for purpose.' Nicola revealed that it would cost. upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard - including a. £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 to install new doors and windows. throughout. The headteacher added: 'Since last year when we moved classes into a corridor, that has been flooded by broken storm drains overflowing. 'It was like a river running down the corridor. We are running out of rooms which don’t have anything wrong with them to be honest. 'It meant we had to take classes into the main hall, which is not ideal. 'I think there are issues over funding for schools. They need to do surveys to make sure schools don’t get to the stage we are at again. 'The most frustrating thing is that the decision on who will receive money keeps on being put back. 'It could be another year before we see any change but I am very optimistic and the minister had nothing but good things to say about the level of teaching. Coventry MP Bob Ainsworth, who has raised the school's plight in parliament, said: 'We made sure the schools minister was aware of the really shocking state of the building and he said it was the worst he had seen. 'I knew that if he came he would be shocked and all we can hope for is that it puts Richard Lee at the centre of minds when it comes to deciding funding allocations for the Priority Schools Building Programme.'","completion":"Highlights: - Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry remains in disrepair, with decaying classrooms and corridors one year on. - Pupils have been forced to hold umbrellas during lessons due to leaks and have lessons in the corridor after classrooms were flooded. - Schools Minister Nick Gibb called the conditions the worst he has ever seen during his visit to the school. - The school is part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. - It is estimated that at least £1 million is needed to bring the school up to standard, including a £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 for new doors and windows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: i = 25*i + 48 The goal is to find out what 'i' is. First, let's try to get all the 'i's on one side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 25*i from both sides.

So, it will be: -24*i = 48 We're almost there! Now, we want to have just 'i' on the left-hand side. To do that, we can divide both sides by -24 so that 'i' stands alone: i = 48 / -24 48 divided by -24 equals -2. So, the value of 'i' is -2. That's our answer! i = -2 Good job!

Marge's cat had black fur and hard to see, she bought her cat a white collar so he was easier to see. The","completion":"white collar not only increased the visibility of her cat but also added a touch of style and elegance to his appearance. It soon became evident that this accessory had a significant impact on both Marge's life and her cat's. As the days went by, neighborhood residents began to take note of the eye-catching little feline that confidently strutted around, proudly showcasing his distinctive collar. It wasn't long before Marge's cat started to attract the attention of the other cats in the area, and they were clearly interested in getting to know him better. The camaraderie among the cats was not something Marge had anticipated, but she was pleased to see her beloved pet making new friends. The white collar had a transformative effect on her cat's social life, enabling him to build strong bonds with his fellow feline companions in the area. His newfound popularity even led to a decrease in territorial squabbles, creating a more harmonious environment for all the neighborhood's cats. Marge was grateful for the sense of community that developed among the local cats, but she also noticed that her cat was becoming more adventurous and spending longer periods of time outside. She was concerned for his safety and well-being but didn't want to deny him the opportunity to explore and socialize with his new friends. To address her concerns, Marge decided to invest in a GPS tracking device for her cat's collar. This way, she could keep an eye on his whereabouts and always know where to find him if needed. The GPS tracking device was compact and lightweight, so it didn't affect the cat's comfort or impede his mobility in any way. With this added security measure, Marge could enjoy peace of mind while her cat continued to thrive in his social circles. Marge's decision to buy her cat a white collar soon became a subject of conversation within the neighborhood. It wasn't just the feline community that took notice of the stylish, popular black cat, but also their human counterparts. Having seen the positive effects that the white collar had on the cat's social life, other cat owners in the area started to purchase similar collars for their pets in different colors and designs. The collar quickly became a trend, and soon enough, the neighborhood was filled with fashionable feline friends sporting unique and stylish collars. The collars not only served as a fashion statement, but also a conversation starter among the pet owners. People who had never spoken to each other before would strike up conversations, as they bonded over their shared experiences and appreciation for their cats. The collars also provided a practical benefit in terms of visibility and safety. With the various colors and designs available, it became easier for both cats and their owners to spot each other from a distance, especially during the evenings and early mornings. It reduced the incidents of near misses with cars and other potential hazards, making the neighborhood safer for both cats and people alike. All in all, Marge's simple decision to buy her black cat a white collar had far-reaching consequences that she never imagined. It not only improved her cat's social life and overall well-being but also fostered a closer-knit community among the pet owners in her neighborhood. The stylish and practical collars transformed the way people interacted with each other, bringing them together through shared interests and an appreciation for the happiness and safety of their feline friends."},{"prompt":"The drive up to Rick's place in the hills always made me sick. Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there.

Here is an article: SEATTLE (AP)  Northwesterners more accustomed to rain and cooler climate sought refuge from a heat wave on Wednesday, as Seattle recorded the hottest temperature in its history and Portland edged closer to its own record-breaker. The National Weather Service in Seattle recorded 102 degrees by midday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, breaking a previous record of 100 degrees, set in downtown Seattle in 1941 and repeated at the airport in 1994. Jay Albrecht, a meteorologist with the service, said it's the hottest it has been in Seattle since records dating to 1891. Meanwhile, Portland ventured into its third day of triple-digit heat Wednesday, hitting 104 degrees by midday. Forecasters said there's a slight chance the city could reach or even surpass its all-time high of 107 degrees, hit four times, most recently in 1981. Doug McDonnal, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Seattle, said the stretch of hot weather has lasted longer than usual. Wednesday was the fifth consecutive day above 85 degrees for Seattle, he said. Throughout the region, shade, icy treats, ice-cold water, air conditioning units and fans were in high demand. Geno Garcia, 40, a Boeing machinist, headed straight for Sears in Seattle early Wednesday when the family's air conditioning unit broke down. \\"We could have lived without it, but it would have been uncomfortable,\\" he said, as he stood in line with about 100 others who bought air conditioners. Garcia said his family plans to keep cool by hunkering down in the one bedroom that's air conditioned. They've already moved their TV, games and other necessities into that room, and have been eating meals there. Darren Wilson, 38, a concrete finisher from Puyallup, Wash., started his Seattle street paving job at 5:30 a.m., three hours earlier than usual, to beat the heat. \\"I'm drinking lots of water,\\" he said. \\"When I get off work, I'm going to my buddy's house and jump in his pool.\\" Portlanders were trying to stay cool every which way. Public fountains were clogged with children. Libraries swelled with people trying to stay out of the sun. And cooling centers for seniors were open late. Shirley Markstaller, 71, parked herself in front of a fan and read the morning paper at a cooling center in downtown Portland. She doesn't have an air conditioner at home, so she's been coming to the center every day for the past week or so. \\"I just thought, where's the coolest place?\\" she said. The weather throughout the Willamette Valley wasn't much better. Temperatures hit triple digits in Medford, Eugene and Salem by Wednesday afternoon. Coastal cities were cooler, including Astoria and Newport. Temperatures in Bend, Pendleton and La Grande had already reached the 90s by midday. Forecasters have issued an excessive heat warning for much of western Washington through Friday. A heat advisory is in effect through Thursday in parts of eastern Washington, including the Yakima Valley and lower Columbia Basin. Temperatures in western Washington were expected to cool off somewhat on Friday but will still be in the 80s, about 10 degrees higher than usual, McDonnal said. In Olympia, a group of visitors were hoping to cool off at the popular Heritage Park Fountain, but were disappointed to find that the water had been turned off for regular weekly maintenance. \\"We were expecting it to be working,\\" said Lucina Hernandez, 24, of Barcelona, Venezuela. \\"This is very bad.\\" At the Tails-A-Wagging doggie day care in Bellingham, Wash., owner Angi Lenz and her staff kept dogs comfortable with special cooling fans, air conditioning, ice toys and water slides. \\"We have a waiting list to get in this week because of the heat,\\" Lenz said. Not everyone was avoiding the outdoors. Enes Parker, manager of the Lacey Senior Center, said she found indoor air conditioning too cold. Lacey is in Washington, near the state capital of Olympia. \\"I'm one of the few who like the heat,\\" Parker said. \\"I go outside every so often to warm up. I love the heat.

Secretly forged during the Second Age by elven blacksmiths, Sting was passed down through generations and played a pivotal role in the lives of two remarkable Hobbits, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. This epic adventure follows the legacy of the sword, revealing its mysterious origins, and the crucial role it plays in uniting the free peoples of Middle-Earth against the dark forces that threaten to consume the world once again. Act I: In the elven realm of Rivendell, master blacksmith Galadrel crafts a magnificent shortsword, embedded with arcane elven runes. Bestowing the blade with magical abilities, he names it Sting - a weapon conceived to fight the encroaching darkness. As the years pass, the sword lies dormant in the secret vaults of the elves, patiently waiting for its rightful wielder. The story then jumps to Bilbo Baggins, a young Hobbit who, alongside the legendary Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves, embarks on a quest to reclaim the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. During their journey, Bilbo comes upon a hidden chamber within the depths of a misty mountain, where he finds three elven-made swords. One of these swords is Sting, which he takes as his weapon. Act II: Returning to the Shire after his epic adventure, Bilbo discovers the true power of Sting, as it begins to glow brightly in the presence of evil. Together with Gandalf the Grey, he learns about the sword's origins and recognizes its significance in the forthcoming battle against the rising shadows. Bilbo realizes that Sting is not meant for him, but rather for someone else who will play an essential role in the battle. Years later, Bilbo passes his treasured sword Sting to his adopted nephew, Frodo, as he embarks on his own perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. As they learn more about their shared legacy, Frodo and his fellowship must use the power of Sting to overcome numerous enemies and challenges in their path. There are side stories involving other characters, showing their connection to the magical sword. Aragorn, future King of Gondor, feels an inexplicable connection to Sting that hints at the sword's deeper significance. Act III: The climax arrives as Frodo and Sam, guided by Sting's light, successfully reach Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring, freeing Middle-Earth from the dark clutches of Sauron. United by the power of the sword, the peoples of Middle-Earth face the common enemy. The final battle sees Sting playing a crucial role in vanquishing the remaining forces of evil. In conclusion: This thrilling cinematic journey follows the incredible tale of Sting, a sword wielded by two unlikely heroes in two grand adventures.

Ambassador Nikki Haley high-fives a child at a shelter in New Delhi last month. (Manish Swarup/AP) It's difficult to imagine a message more contrary to President Trump's entire ethos than the one offered Monday by his U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley. Haley asked high-schoolers attending a Turning Point USA summit at George Washington University whether they had “posted anything online to quote-unquote 'own the libs,' \\" according to the Hill. (\\"Own the libs\\" or \\"trigger the libs\\" means doing something provocative to upset supposedly over-sensitive liberals.) The students reportedly raised their hands en masse and roared. But then Haley went a different direction. “I know that it’s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you’re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone? Who are you persuading?” Haley asked. “We’ve all been guilty of it at some point or another, but this kind of speech isn’t leadership; it’s the exact opposite.” She added: “Real leadership is about persuasion, it’s about movement, it’s bringing people around to your point of view — not by shouting them down, but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do.” Again, Haley is a political appointee of President Trump. Trump's entire political strategy is basically about “owning the libs” — and, in the process, making his base rally around him. Haley's comments may not have been intended for Trump, but much like first lady Melania Trump's anti-bullying campaign, there would seem to be some cognitive dissonance here. This is hardly the first time Haley has offered a somewhat discordant view from inside the Trump administration, but often that's been about establishing her personal independence. This is perhaps the most pronounced example of her separating herself from Trump's version of the Republican Party. Haley's choice of venue to deliver those lines is particularly noteworthy: TPUSA is a fast-growing group of young conservatives, led by provocateur and Trump ally Charlie Kirk, that is \\"known for its anti-political-correctness, aggressive legal tactics and alleged associations with racism,\\" as the Post's Eliza Gray wrote earlier this month. In other words, Haley decided to deliver this message to an audience that would likely not love it, but she decided to deliver it there anyway. And while it might be a nice sentiment that is cheered across the aisle, it's not exactly the kind of attitude that is ascendant on the red team. Trump is more popular with the GOP base than basically any recent Republican president, and his bull-in-a-china-shop style has spurred culture wars in which most Republicans are happy warriors. Haley's approach, then, is counterintuitive for someone who is considered to be a rising star within the GOP — and even a possible future presidential candidate. Haley, if she is interested in climbing the ranks, seems to be betting on a more genteel and pragmatic version of conservatism while the party in recent years has demonstrated it desires anything but. Trump's entire election was basically a middle finger to political moderation — both in policy and rhetoric. It does seem to be working for Haley, though — at least for now. She appears to be the most popular member of the Trump administration, pulling off the unique trick of wooing Democrats with her independence while not alienating Republicans. (Democrats approved of her 55 percent to 23 percent after her “I don't get confused” rebuke of Larry Kudlow, and Republicans approved 75 to 9.) She's also extremely popular with the young conservative crowd she was speaking to Monday. Haley's political Teflon dates to 2015, when she went where Southern Republicans generally didn't go by siding against the Confederate flag. She wound up bringing the party with her rather than suffering for her apostasy. And that trend has continued with her in the Trump administration. But it has also worked as she has been a relatively infrequent presence on the national stage, occasionally popping up when the moment demanded or allowed for it. Were she to apply this kind of approach to a presidential or other campaign in the coming years, it would seem unlikely to catch fire — unless she's able to persuade the party to completely change course and abandon its newfound Trumpiness. Whether it works is the big, unanswered question. But if she does have higher aspirations, she could provide one of the most interesting — and unique — voices in the battle over the future course of the GOP.

Who are you persuading?” Haley asked. “We’ve all been guilty of it at some point or another, but this kind of speech isn’t leadership — it’s the exact opposite.” “Real leadership is about persuasion, it’s about movement, it’s bringing people around to your point of view,” she added. “Not by shouting them down, but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do.” Haley, who was introduced to the audience by her son, said leadership is lacking in this country. However, she also said those in the room Monday made her want to bet on the future.

Human Rights Council, which she called a joke. She also criticized countries she said agreed with the United States off-the-record but would not publicly support change on the council. “They lack the courage to make a difference,” Haley said. “They have a voice, they just refuse to use it.” Haley, who received a standing ovation both coming and going from her speech, posed for students' pictures for a few minutes after concluding her time. “If I can leave you with one message today: Have the courage to stand up to the mob,” she said. ||||| Not in favor of “owning libs.” Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a oft-mentioned future presidential candidate, told a group of conservative high-school students on Monday that one of their favorite activities might be “fun,” and might “feel good,” but it’s not always in their best interest. She was talking, of course, about “owning the libs.” The Hill provides a transcript of Haley’s remarks on the subject: “Raise your hand if you’ve ever posted anything online to quote-unquote ‘own the libs,’” Haley asked at the High School Leadership Summit at George Washington University. The vast majority raised their hands in response, and then erupted into spontaneous applause. “I know that it’s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you’re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone?

The group famously hosted an event at Kent State University last October that saw a student in a diaper, sucking a pacifier and sitting in a playpen. The point? To mock the “safe spaces” that liberal students were demanding. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, urged conservative high school students at a Turning Point USA summit to avoid inflammatory language and focus on demonstrating real leadership. Instead of trying to \\"own the libs,\\" which refers to intentionally upsetting liberals, Haley emphasized that real leadership involves persuasion and bringing people around to your point of view. Haley, considered a rising star within the GOP and a possible future presidential candidate, has managed to gain popularity among both Democrats and Republicans despite her occasional divergence from President Trump's policies and rhetoric."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"50,000 human figures are digging for gold here. English: This sentence, translated into English, describes a situation where a large number of people, specifically 50,000 individuals, are diligently searching for gold. The use of the term \\"human figures\\" implies that the individuals may not be fully discernible, possibly due to distance or other factors that might obscure their appearance. Nonetheless, it is clear that these people are working industriously to unearth the precious metal, gold. The reasons for their collective effort might include monetary gain, resource acquisition, or perhaps an event or competition requiring such actions. This scene paints a vivid image of a massive gold rush or an expansive mining operation that spans a considerable area. The sheer number of people involved underscores the significance and perceived value of unearthing gold, which is often linked to wealth, luxury, and financial stability. Throughout history, the pursuit of this highly sought-after metal has fueled numerous expeditions, economic booms, and profound social shifts, such as the California Gold Rush or the Klondike Gold Rush. Various factors could contribute to such a large number of people digging for gold. One possibility is the recent discovery of a gold deposit, which may have attracted thousands of individuals to flock to the area in hopes of striking it rich. Others may have arrived to participate in organizations or events that offer lucrative rewards for the successful searchers. Alternatively, these 50,000 human figures might be part of an intentional collective endeavor aimed at reaping the benefits of gold mining for national, corporate, or personal motives. In any case, the convergence of people on this scale illustrates the enduring allure of gold as an iconic symbol of status, worth, and fortune. The environmental and social impacts of these activities also warrant consideration. The pursuit of gold often leads to the erosion and destruction of natural habitats, and the resulting influx of people can strain existing resources and communities. Although gold remains a coveted commodity, there should be ongoing conversations and collaborative efforts to balance its extraction with the preservation of our planet and its interconnected ecosystems. In summary, the translated phrase \\"50,000 human figures are digging for gold here\\" presents a powerful image of a massive collective undertaking driven by the allure of financial gain and prosperity. The reasons behind this pursuit, as well as the broader social, environmental, and economic implications, offer intriguing insights into the nature of human ambition and the power of collaboration toward a shared goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle.

He held off two other cars until damage caused by a broken brake duct forced a late retirement. \\"The team is not very competitive now; there's nothing we can do from one day to another,\\" he said. \\"At the same time, the team is expecting an extra result from me now, as we did in Australia, when the predictions say we are last. \\"If in China they say we are last, hopefully Alonso will be in the points.\\" However, Alonso said it was \\"a little bit difficult to understand\\" how the engine could have \\"done a step backwards this year\\".

He turned his head suddenly to the wall. Mr. Thorndike stood irresolute, and then sank back into his chair.

She leaves to place the order and the diners begin chatting and sipping on their water. Kim remarks that her water is room temperature and she wishes that it was cooler. Janet states that her water is so cold it hurts her teeth and wishes hers was warmer. They agree to mention it to the waitress when she returns. But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. What is an answer for this question: Which person's water has molecules moving faster? Answer:","completion":"Kim's water has molecules moving faster. In this situation, Kim's water is at room temperature and Janet's water is so cold that it hurts her teeth. Considering the information about liquid water and its temperature behavior, as the water temperature increases, its molecular motion becomes faster. Conversely, as the water temperature decreases, the molecular motion slows down. Since Kim's water is warmer than Janet's water, the molecules in Kim's water are moving faster as they have higher kinetic energy associated with increased temperature. Janet's water has slower moving molecules due to its colder temperature and the decreased kinetic energy of the molecules."},{"prompt":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This film screened last night at Austin's Paramount theater as part of the SXSW Film Festival. We were graced with the presence of director Mike Binder and stars Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle who took audience questions after the film. It is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back. The performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare. (The trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects.) This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler. While he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish, this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor. He deserves an Oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as Tom Hanks did and Jim Carrey is also doing. In this role, he seemed to be trying to channel Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than Sandler's traumatized character, both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child-like isolation and confusion. Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising, but just as good. After Hotel Rwanda and Crash, we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from Cheadle. He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role. But he, too, is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as Sandler's character. Cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist. Together the characters played by Cheadle and Sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do (in a way that reminds me of Matt Damon and Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting). They are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again. Reign over Me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year. The soundtrack, which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. The filming in the streets of New York - a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself - is also quite beautiful. The supporting roles by Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows (in a very odd role), Donald Sutherland, and Mike Binder himself are all quite good. Writer/Director Mike Binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels. This is a story about grief, family, healing, male friendship, mental health, and the meaning of love. Reign over Me does not disappoint. The film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters. Hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character-driven charming films like Reign over Me.

He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker.

After several weeks of discussion and weighing the pros and cons of each option, the family members concluded that a porch would not only offer a versatile space but also fit better within their budget. In a time of economic instability, the family believed that going for a more financially sound decision would be beneficial in the long run. Furthermore, the homeowners had also factored in the increased costs of heating and cooling associated with a sun room in their decision-making process. While a sun room would have beautifully displayed natural sunlight and provided a picturesque view of the surrounding landscape, it would also mean significantly higher energy bills throughout the year. The family also consulted with an architect who advised them on the practicality of adding a porch versus a sun room. They learned that a porch would be easier and faster to build, causing less disruption to their home life. Moreover, the porch could be added without the need for any significant structural changes to the house, making the construction process much faster and more cost-effective. As they began planning their new porch, they discovered there were many opportunities to make the space welcoming and functional, despite the lower price point. With the help of a skilled designer, they chose a beautiful and durable material for the flooring and selected outdoor furniture that would be resistant to the elements. The family envisioned their future porch as a peaceful retreat for reading, enjoying a morning coffee, and watching the sunset in the evenings. They also saw it as a place where they could entertain friends and family members during casual gatherings or barbecues. By adding potted plants and flowers around the perimeter, the porch would be a beautiful, natural space that would seamlessly blend with their property's landscaping. Throughout the process, the family members occasionally second-guessed their choice to prioritize cost savings over the luxury of a sun room. However, they continued to reassure themselves that they had made the right decision by focusing on their future enjoyment and the potential memories they would create on their porch. Once the construction was complete, the family was delighted with their new addition. The porch served as a relaxing sanctuary for each member to unwind after a hard day's work, spend quality time together, and experience a deeper connection with nature. While a sun room might have provided a more sheltered and warm space, the porch's open design allowed them to embrace their love for the outdoors and delight in the fresh breeze, sunshine, and bird songs. In the end, the family embraced their decision to build a porch wholeheartedly, understanding that this choice would be a wise investment for both their finances and the long-lasting memories they would create on this beautiful, functional, and budget-friendly addition to their home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Unlike plants, animal species rely almost exclusively on what type of reproduction? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Introduction Plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their species. Some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely almost exclusively on sexual reproduction. Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents. Flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants. With their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and sizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs. Other plants pollinate via wind or water; still others self-pollinate. Choices: - pollination - multiplication - regeneration - sexual reproduction A:","completion":"Step 1: Read the paragraph carefully to understand the context of the question.

It is essential to understand and analyze the reasons behind this recommendation to ensure a well-informed decision. Firstly, the reviewer mentioned that the app works with their Samsung S4 but experienced difficulty when using it on their Note 4, specifically in terms of amperage display. This indicates that the app might not be compatible or have certain issues with specific devices. Compatibility and functionality are essential in terms of using any app. However, since it does work on the Samsung S4, there could be a possibility that your friend's device might not experience the same issue. Secondly, the reviewer states that the app is \\"not accurate,\\" which raises concerns about the app's performance and reliability. It is vital for an app, especially one measuring battery charging details, to provide accurate information to the users. This inaccuracy can lead to potential misjudgments by the users and may affect their device's battery life and performance in the long run. However, it's also important to note that app experiences can be subjective, and the reviewer might have encountered a unique issue that other users have not. Lastly, the reviewer's negative experience should not be entirely overlooked. For your friend, it's essential to have a more comprehensive overview of the app by checking other reviews and making an informed decision based on feedback from a more extensive user base. There could be other user reviews that might provide a more positive experience with the app or explain solutions to the encountered issue.

Taliban attack kills dozens of soldiers in eastern Afghanistan Taliban insurgents assaulted a checkpoint in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, leaving 19 soldiers dead and seven missing, officials said. It was the deadliest single incident for the Afghan army in at least a year. General Mohammad Zahir Azimi, spokesman for the defence ministry, said “hundreds” of foreign and Afghan insurgents were involved in the attack, which took place in the Ghazi Abad district of Kunar province in the early hours. He confirmed that 19 soldiers were dead and two injured following a four-hour gun battle between the insurgents and the army. An army support unit en route to assist the operation was also targeted by a suicide bomber, he said, but there were no military casualties. An investigation and search and rescue operation was under way, Azimi said. Abdul Ghani Musamem, spokesman for the governor of Kunar Province, said seven soldiers were missing following the attack. It was not immediately clear if the soldiers had been kidnapped or had fled during the assault. President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack and postponed a planned trip to Sri Lanka. Karzai appeared to point a finger at Pakistan, calling on the government in Islamabad to take on the fight against terrorism. He said in a statement that Pakistan must take serious measures to destroy terrorist sanctuaries.Kunar lies along the border with Pakistan. It is a militant stronghold, and many Arab and other foreign insurgents are believed to operate there alongside the Afghan Taliban. Kabul has repeatedly accused Islamabad of providing the insurgents sanctuary on its territory following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in an emailed statement, saying that one of their insurgents was killed and two were wounded. The Taliban have escalated attacks in recent months as they try to take advantage of the withdrawal of foreign troops at the end of 2014. Casualties among Afghan troops have been rising significantly since they took the lead in the war against the Taliban. Since the beginning of 2014, 84 Afghan army soldiers have been killed. Meanwhile the spokesman for Afghanistan’s Taliban said they had suspended “mediation” with the United States to exchange captive US soldier Bowe Bergdahl for five senior Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay. In a terse emailed statement on Sunday, Zabihullah Mujahed blamed the “current complex political situation in the country” for the suspension of what was considered the best chance of securing Bergdahl’s freedom since his capture in 2009. It is the first official acknowledgement of indirect talks with the US to free Bergdahl. Bergdahl, 27, of Hailey, Idaho, was last seen in a video released in December, footage seen as “proof of life” demanded by the United States.

This album was the first to feature bassist Jason Newsted, who joined the band following the tragic death of their original bassist, Cliff Burton, in a bus accident in 1986. Before joining Metallica, Jason Newsted was part of several other bands, as detailed below: 1. Flotsam and Jetsam: Newsted was a founding member of the thrash metal band Flotsam and Jetsam, formed in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1981. He played bass and contributed to songwriting for the band's debut album, \\"Doomsday for the Deceiver,\\" which was released in 1986. After Cliff Burton's death, Newsted auditioned for Metallica and eventually left Flotsam and Jetsam to join them. 2. Ozzy Osbourne: Although not an official member, Newsted had a brief stint playing bass for Ozzy Osbourne during the Diary of a Madman tour in 1986 as a temporary replacement for Rudy Sarzo. This opportunity came just before Newsted joined Metallica. 3. Echobrain: After leaving Metallica in 2001, Newsted formed the alternative rock band Echobrain with vocalist/guitarist Dylan Donkin and drummer/programmer Brian Sagrafena. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2002, showcasing Newsted's versatility as a bassist in a genre different from his thrash metal roots. 4. Ozzy Osbourne (again): In 2003, Newsted briefly rejoined Ozzy Osbourne's band for the recording of the album \\"Bark at the Moon.\\" However, he left the project before it was completed due to an injury. 5. Voivod: In 2002, Newsted became the bassist for Canadian progressive metal band Voivod, contributing not only to their 2003 self-titled album but also to their 2006 release, \\"Katorz.\\" Furthermore, he played with the band at various live performances and festivals. 6. Newsted: In 2012, Jason Newsted formed a new heavy metal band under his last name. The band released the \\"Metal\\" EP in 2013, followed by the full-length album \\"Heavy Metal Music\\" later that same year. Unfortunately, the band disbanded in early 2014.

Step 3: Solve for d To solve for d, we need to isolate the variable d on one side of the equation. Since d is currently being multiplied by -810, we need to perform the opposite operation, which is dividing by -810, in order to isolate d.

He is reluctant to believe but, in the end, accepts Paige's assertion. However, his mother finally recognizes him and tells him that she stole him as a baby and she has no idea who his real parents are.

Sentence 2: Elsewhere in Europe, Philips was up 3.8 percent after saying on Friday it was seeing positive developments with its U.S. dollar sales. Step 1: Both sentences start with \\"Elsewhere in Europe,\\" which implies the same geographic context. Step 2: Both sentences mention Philips as the subject; however, the percentage increase is different (4.6% vs. 3.8%), which indicates a difference in the extent of the increase. Step 3: In sentence 1, the reason for the increase is attributed to \\"raising its targets for chip sales,\\" while in sentence 2, it is attributed to \\"seeing positive developments with its U.S. dollar sales.\\" These reasons imply different factors: one related to chip sales specifically (possibly electronic components) and the other related to overall U.S. dollar sales (which could include various products and services).

Ash might have felt hurt, betrayed, or angered by the mean lies that Bailey was spreading about them, which led to the physical confrontation – smacking Bailey's lips.

There are about 60 thousand adoptions each year in the United States alone. Some people prefer to adopt _ , others adopt older children, some couples adopt children from their own countries, and others adopt children from foreign countries. In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason ---- they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life. Most adopted children know that they are adopted. Psychologists and child-care experts generally think this is a good idea. However, many adopted children or adoptees have very little information about their biological parents. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed. The information is secret so no one can see it. Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do.

She is the patron saint of several churches in France and England and of Jesus College, Cambridge (whose full name is \\"The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist \\"and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund\\", near Cambridge\\"). - Theodahad (born c. 480 in Tauresium died 536) was the King of the Ostrogoths from 534 to 536 and a nephew of Theodoric the Great through his sister Amalafrida. - Baderic, Baderich, Balderich or Boderic (ca. 480 529), son of Bisinus and Basina, was a co-king of the Thuringii. He and his brothers Hermanfrid and Berthar succeeded their father Bisinus. After Hermanfrid defeated Berthar in battle, he invited King Theuderic I of Metz to help him defeat Baderic in return for half of the kingdom. Theuderic I agreed and Baderic was defeated and killed in 529. Hermanfrid became the sole king. - Wacho (or Waccho) (probably Waldchis) was king of the Lombards before they entered Italy from an unknown date (perhaps c. 510) until his death in 539. His father was Unichis. Wacho usurped the throne by assassinating (or having assassinated) his uncle, King Tato (again, probably around 510). Tato's son Ildchis fought with him and fled to the Gepids where he died. Wacho had good relations with the Franks. - Theodemir was king of the Ostrogoths of the Amal Dynasty, and father of Theoderic the Great. He had two \\"brothers\\" (actually brothers-in-law) named Valamir and Videmir. Theodemir was Arian, while his wife Erelieva was Catholic and took the Roman Christian name Eusebia upon her baptism. He took over the three Pannonian Goth reigns after the death of Widimir, ruled jointly with his brothers-in-law as a vassal of Attila the Hun. The reason is probably that this relatively long reign of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia, while his elder brother Thiudimir only for four years on the throne, followed by Theoderic, and firstly inherited, the heirless, Walamir's part of the kingdom. He was married to Erelieva, with whom he had two children: Theoderic (454526) and Amalafrida. When Theodemir died in 475, Theoderic succeeded him as king. - Hermanfrid (also Hermanifrid or Hermanafrid) was the last independent king of the Thuringii in present-day Germany. He was one of three sons of King Bessinus (or Bisinus) and the Lombard Menia (or Basina). His siblings were Baderic; Radegund (the elder), married to the Lombard king Wacho; and Bertachar. - Amalafrid ( Latin : Amalafridas , Greek : ' ) was the son of the last Thuringian king Hermanafrid and his wife Amalaberga , daughter of Amalafrida and niece of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great . After the fall of the royal Thuringian seat of Scithingi to the king of Metz , Theuderic I in 531 , Amalaberga fled to the Ostrogothic king Theodahad , her brother , with Amalafrid and his sister Rodelinda . They were captured by the Byzantine general Belisarius and sent to Constantinople , together with the captured Ostrogothic king Witiges ( or Wittigis ) . Justinian made Amalafrid a general and married off his sister Rodelinda to the Lombard king Audoin . When the Lombards applied to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I for help against the Gepids , he sent an army under the command of Justinus and Justinianus , the sons of Germanus ; Aratius and Suartuas ( a former ruler of the Heruli ) ; and Amalafrid . All the former remained in Ulpiana , Illyria , to decide on a question of doctrine among the local Christians . Amalafrid led part of the Roman army against the Gepids . As Audoin afterwards sent envoys to Justinian to complain about the lack of Imperial help , this seems to have been only a small part of the original army . Nevertheless , Amalafrid and the Lombard host under Audoin won a major victory over the Gepids . Amalafrid had a son named Artachis ( see Venantius Fortunatus , Carm . App. 3 ) but nothing further is known of his fate . - Amalaberga was the daughter of Amalafrida, daughter of Theodemir, king of the Ostrogoths. Her father is unknown, her uncle was Theodoric the Great. She married Hermanfrid, king of the Thuringii. They had a son named Amalafrid and a daughter Rodelinda, who married the Lombard king Audoin. According to Procopius (History of the Wars V, 13), after Hermanfrid's death, she fled with her children to her brother Theodahad who was at that time (534-36) King of the Ostrogoths. - Alduin, Auduin, or Audoin (Langobardic: \\"Aldwin\\", or \\"Hildwin\\") was king of the Lombards from 546 to 560. Under him the Lombards became fœderati of the Byzantines (541), signing a treaty with Justinian I which gave them power in Pannonia and the north. Beginning in 551, Audoin was obliged to send troops to serve Narses in Italy in the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths. The next year (552), he sent over 5,000 men to defeat the Goths on the slopes of Vesuvius. That same year Audoin had been able to inflict a heavy defeat on the Gepids with the help of his brother-in-law Amalafrid: the Gepid king Thurisind lost his eldest son, Turismod, in the Battle of Asfeld during which the prince was killed by Alboin, son of Audoin.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival. Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular. In September 1992 Rouvas released his second album, Min Andistekese (Don't Resist), also composed by Nikos Terzis. It produced the singles \\"Gyrna\\" (\\"Return\\"), \\"Min Andistekese\\", \\"Na Ziseis Moro Mou\\" (\\"Live, My Baby\\") and \\"Me Kommeni Tin Anasa\\" (\\"Breathless\\"), with a music video of the title track. The album's success helped establish Rouvas at the top of the Greek music scene. In October 1993 Rouvas released his third album, Gia Sena (For You), with music by Alexis Papadimitriou and lyrics by Eleni Giannatsoulia and Evi Droutsa. The single \\"Kane Me\\" (\\"Make Me\\") became a radio hit, with \\"To Xero Eisai Moni\\" (\\"I Know You Are Alone\\") and \\"Xehase To\\" (\\"Forget It\\") also receiving airplay.

An understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development. Objective: The spectrum of SARS-specific antibody profiles in SARS patients was investigated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Study design: Serial serum samples from 14 SARS patients were isolated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms, and were tested for anti-viral IgG and IgM by indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFA), anti-nucleocaspid antibody by ELISA tests and viral neutralization. Results: Anti-viral (IgG) and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were observed in 13 of 14 patients at 14 days after the onset of symptoms, and in all 14 patients at 30-210 days thereafter. Anti-viral antibody (IgM) was detected maximally at 30 days, later than that for the IgG class. IgM antibody declined and became undetectable between 60 to 180 days after the onset of the symptoms. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the sera from all of the patients with SARS symptoms. Conclusions: Anti-viral IgG, IgM, and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were detected 7-30 days in patients after the onset of SARS symptoms. Anti-viral IgM antibodies disappeared earlier than IgG.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees.

Question 1: What were the main arguments of each of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriages? Question 2: Why did the Supreme Court rule in favor of same-sex marriages? Choose from: A). no; B). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer your questions, I will first provide the main arguments of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriage and then explain why the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages. Finally, I will determine if the answers to these questions are the same. Question 1: The main arguments of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriages in the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, were as follows: 1. Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the legislative process, as opposed to being determined by the courts. He expressed concern for the implications of judicial overreach, emphasizing that the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right to same-sex marriage. 2. Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the majority decision as a threat to democracy and as an overreach of judicial power. He believed that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people through democratic processes, not by an unelected judiciary. 3. Justice Clarence Thomas questioned the fundamental right to same-sex marriage, arguing that it was not rooted in the Constitution. He also raised concerns about how the ruling would impact religious liberty and maintained that states, rather than the federal government, should have the power to regulate marriage. 4. Justice Samuel Alito worried that the decision could lead to potential conflicts with religious freedom for those who hold traditional views on marriage. He too argued that the definition of marriage should be determined by the democratic process. Question 2: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages in Obergefell v. Hodges for several reasons: 1. Equal protection under the law: The majority opinion, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, stated that the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law, including the right to marry for same-sex couples. Denying this right would be a violation of due process and equal protection. 2. Marriage as a fundamental right: The Court determined that the right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Thus, any restrictions on individuals based on their sexual orientation would be subject to strict scrutiny, and the states' bans on same-sex marriage failed to meet this high standard. 3. Dignity and autonomy: The majority opinion emphasized that marriage conferred dignity and respect on couples and that denying same-sex couples the right to marry would be a violation of their dignity and autonomy. Lemma: From the given options A) No and B) Yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same? Since the dissenting justices' arguments focused on concerns regarding judicial overreach, deference to the democratic process, the interpretation of the Constitution, and concerns about religious liberty, while the Supreme Court's majority opinion emphasized equal protection, fundamental rights, and dignity and autonomy, the answers are fundamentally different in their reasoning. Therefore, I choose A) No, the answer to these two questions would not be the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: who was the god of the underworld in ancient egypt? A:","completion":"A: The god of the underworld in ancient Egypt was Osiris, a central figure in the ancient Egyptian mythology and belief system. Osiris held significant power and was seen as a key player in the cycles of life, death, and the afterlife. Egyptians revered Osiris as the god of transition, regeneration, and resurrection. Osiris was first recognized during the earliest periods of Egyptian history, as far back as the Fifth Dynasty, circa 2400 BCE. Over time, his story and imagery became an essential aspect of Egyptian religion. Osiris was typically depicted as a mummified man with green or black skin, signifying his association with fertility, growth, and resurrection. He wore the atef crown, consisting of tall white feathers surrounded by a pair of tightly curled ram's horns, and held significant attributes such as the crook and flail, which symbolized his authority over life and death. Osiris was the first son of Geb (the god of the earth) and Nut (the goddess of the sky). His siblings included Isis, Nephthys, and Seth. Osiris was believed to have been married to his sister, Isis, and together, they ruled Egypt. The story goes that Osiris was a wise and just ruler, teaching the people about agriculture, animal husbandry, and the principles of justice and order. However, his brother Seth, the god of chaos and violence, grew jealous and determined to usurp the throne. Seth murdered Osiris by tricking him into a coffin, which he then sealed and threw into the Nile. Isis, with the aid of her sister Nephthys, searched for and found Osiris's body, but Seth discovered them and chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces, scattering them across Egypt. Isis then embarked on a quest to recover all of the pieces, during which she managed to reassemble Osiris's body, save for one part (his phallus) which had been eaten by a fish. Despite this, with the help of Thoth, Anubis, and other gods, Isis managed to revive Osiris for a brief period, which was just enough time for her to conceive their son, Horus. Osiris could not return to the world of the living due to his incomplete state, and instead, became the ruler of the underworld. In this new capacity, he reigned over the realm of the dead and judged the souls of the deceased. The ancient Egyptians believed that those deemed worthy by Osiris would be granted eternal life and peace, while those found unworthy would be subjected to torment and suffering. The afterlife's success was not guaranteed; it required an intimate knowledge of the right spells, rituals, and specific ethical behaviors that Osiris valued. Osiris was a major figure in ancient Egyptian funerary rites, as evidenced in the \\"Book of the Dead\\" and other funerary texts. He was often invoked to guide and protect the souls of the dead as they made their journey towards the afterlife. His stories and mythology offered hope to the ancient Egyptians, promising the potential for rebirth, life after death, and the enduring abundance of their land. In conclusion, Osiris was the god of the underworld in ancient Egypt, who played a crucial role in their belief system surrounding life, death, and the afterlife, as well as being a central character in their mythology. He represented themes of transition, regeneration, and resurrection, and eternally presided over the destinies of those who passed on from the mortal realm."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.

Joseph Caputo scaled a fence on the North Lawn at 2:45 p.m., according to Secret Service spokesperson Robert Hoback. The jumper was immediately apprehended and taken into custody. According to two CNN photojournalists who witnessed the incident, the men was carrying an envelope, had on a blue shirt and white pants and was cloaked in an American flag. They said the officers who detained him had their guns drawn and were accompanied by K-9 units. Vanessa Pena, an intern on Capitol Hill, was playing tourist with her twin sister who was in town for Thanksgiving. \\"We were just standing there and the man came up behind us,\\" she told CNN. \\"I heard him take a deep breath and say, 'All right, let's do this.'\\" Pena said the man \\"ran through\\" she and her sister before he jumped over a barricade, and then the fence. ||||| A man wearing an American flag and carrying a binder in his mouth was arrested after he jumped the fence at the White House Thursday afternoon, police said. Uniformed officers from the U.S. Secret Service quickly apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn about 2:45 p.m., as the first family spent the Thanksgiving holiday inside the White House. “Even though it was a national holiday, the Secret Service showed it could move quickly to apprehend a fence jumper,” House Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a statement. “However, the failure of the new White House perimeter fence, despite its recent modifications with spikes, is both baffling and discouraging.\\" Norton, a senior member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said she and other members of Congress were shown samples of the spikes bolted to the taller fence in the summer and were assured no one would be able to jump the enhanced fence.

Meagan Fitzgerald reports. (Published Friday, Nov. 27, 2015) Caputo was the first person to jump the fence since the spikes were installed. Victoria Pena of Houston said the man was standing with other people visiting the White House compound when he rushed toward the fence carrying what appeared to be a binder. \\"I just heard him take a big, deep breath and whisper to himself, \`All right, let's do this,' and he took off,'' Pena said. \\"It was chaotic. Everyone around us was yelling, and kids were crying. It was pretty unexpected.\\" \\"Casually, I'm just there taking pictures and I see a ninja coming through, climbing,” witness Amar Marwaha of London told News4. Security personnel and guard dogs ran toward the man and he lay on the grass awaiting them, Pena said. Charges are pending. Man Draped in American Flag Jumps White House Fence A man wrapped in an American flag jumped the fence at the White House but was quickly taken into custody. (Published Thursday, Nov. 26, 2015) The White House was locked down until about 6:30 p.m. The Secret Service also is investigating a 2003 Ford Taurus with Connecticut license plates with \\"Caputs\\" on them that was parked more than three miles away from the White House at Hains Point. Law enforcement sources said it's Caputo's car. It was the seventh time in two years someone has jumped the White House fence. The most serious incident was in September 2014, when Omar Gonzalez made it all the way into the White House carrying a knife. About a month later, Dominic Adesanya scaled the perimeter before the K9s took him down. Then in April, Jerome Hunt took a bus from California just to jump the fence in D.C. The National Park Service is in the process of enhancing security around the White House. Permanent changes to the White House fence and checkpoints are expected in fall 2016. Norton will ask for a meeting with Secret Service officers early next week.

Answer the following question: - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in which the liver plays its vital role in digestion, detoxification, and storage of essential nutrients can be broadly described as the receipt and filtration of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals from the digestive tract. This crucial initial process can be further broken down into the following sub-steps: 1. Absorption of nutrients in the digestive tract: The initial stage begins in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. When we consume food, it gets broken down into smaller components like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. This process of breaking down food is called digestion. As the food continues to pass through the small intestine, the vital nutrients are absorbed through the intestinal walls and enter the bloodstream. 2. Transport of blood to the liver: Once the nutrients have entered into the bloodstream, they are transported directly to the liver via the hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein is a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, spleen, and pancreas to the liver. 3. Blood filtration by the liver: As the blood enriched with nutrients reaches the liver, the process of filtration begins. The liver primarily acts as a purification station for the blood. It removes any toxic substances or harmful byproducts that might have entered the bloodstream during digestion. The liver also metabolizes drugs or other foreign substances, breaking them down into forms that can be more easily excreted from the body. In summary, the first step of the liver's role in digestion, detoxification, and storage of essential nutrients is the receipt and filtration of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals from the digestive tract, primarily through the hepatic portal vein. This step ensures that the liver can process the good nutrients for the rest of the body, produce bile to aid in fat absorption, and store extra carbohydrates as glycogen for future energy needs, all while discarding waste materials and detoxifying the blood."},{"prompt":"As animals grow their bones get longer and bigger, they grow more hair, and are able to take care of themselves by getting food, shelter, and water.

Hanson is an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States, formed by brothers Isaac (guitar, bass, piano, vocals), Taylor (keyboards, piano, guitar, drums, vocals), and Zac (drums, piano, guitar, vocals). Supporting members include Dimitrius Collins (keyboards, guitar), and Andrew Perusi (bass) who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007. They are best known for the 1997 hit song \\"MMMBop\\" from their debut album released through Mercury, Polygram, Middle of Nowhere, which earned three Grammy nominations. Despite the enormous commercial success of Middle of Nowhere, the band suffered from the merger that eliminated their label, Mercury Records . Middle of Nowhere was released in the US on May 6, 1997, selling 10 million copies worldwide. May 6 was declared 'Hanson Day' in Tulsa by Oklahoma's then-governor Frank Keating. Although 'Hanson Day' was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, many Hanson fans all over the world still recognize May 6 as Hanson Day every year. Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson's first documentary Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere and their Christmas album Snowed In in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched MOE (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. Hanson: The Official Book reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled Live From Albertane, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary The Road to Albertane. In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released MMMBop as 3 Car Garage, minus four tracks, in May 1998. To date, the tracks from Boomerang have not been re-released. Three tracks from Boomerang (\\"Boomerang\\", \\"More Than Anything\\", and \\"Rain (Falling Down)\\") and two of the remaining tracks from MMMBop (\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Baby (You're So Fine)\\") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members. During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what would later become the songs for their second major studio album, This Time Around. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. Almost immediately following the changeover in May 2000, Hanson released their second album, This Time Around, but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour. The band toured through the summer and fall of 2000 on their own funds. Entity:","completion":"This text is about Hanson, an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Tony is more likely to experience more tooth decay than Greg. This is because Tony is eating a bowl of candy, which typically contains high amounts of sugar. The bacteria in the mouth feed on the sugar, producing acid that can weaken the tooth enamel and cause decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which is a healthier and less sugary snack.

WWII veteran Delbert Belton, 89, died Thursday after being beaten to death by two black teenagers. Just this week, Christopher Lane was gunned down by three black teenagers. When is the MSM going to wake up to the terror of black on white crime? The only crime that matters to the MSM is white on black crime. The primary example being George Zimmerman, a Hispanic, shooting Trayvon Martin in self-defense. But Zimmerman was light enough to pass for white, so it worked. Mission accomplished. But the MSM is ignoring the rampant, calculated attack on whites by blacks that have occurred recently. On Wednesday, WWII veteran Delbert Belton was viciously attacked by two black teenagers, between the ages of 16 and 19. He was confronted in a parking lot across from Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Washington and jumped in the parking lot. He was mauled by his attackers and left for dead. He succumbed to his injuries Thursday morning. Where is the outrage for Delbert Belton? Where are the race baiters, never ones to shy away from an opportunity for some time in the bright lights of the national spotlight? They’re gone. Silent. This is the wrong kind of crime. Race baiters only show up when the black man is the victim. Which in the case of George Zimmerman, the truth is Zimmerman was the victim, but the truth never will help keep the spirit of racism alive and well. The Al Sharpton’s and Jesse Jackson’s of the world need perceived “racism” to prosper from the idea of black inferiority. They need someone to blame for the horrific problems within the black community. Taking individual responsibility is not possible. No one profits monetarily from it. And keeping the black man down only props the race baiters up. It’s all about power. But Delbert Belton was an innocent man, a veteran. He had been shot in the leg at Okinawa. He’s a hero, and he died in the most savage way possible. He was targeted by two young black men, who knew he was elderly, and they ravaged him. There is no greater horror than this, for a young person to viciously attack an elderly man. Now who’s crying racism? Thank God for actor James Woods and his tireless twitter campaign to get the Delbert Belton tragedy in the forefront of media attention. #DelbertBelton. Please RT. Don't let him die without anyone caring. — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013 And for calling out bigots. If people use bigoted references re African Americans, they are rightfully summarily discharged from networks. Why is Sharpton exempt? — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 22, 2013 Amen to that. The death of Delbert Belton, a veteran, is one that should never go unnoticed by the public. But it will by bigots like Al Sharpton. The horrors of racial crime have been outrageous this week, with the senseless and shocking death of Christopher Lane in Oklahoma on Monday. The 22-year-old college student was out jogging when he was followed and shot by three black teenagers who were looking for “fun.” The shock and horror of this event is more than one can bear. But look at the “thug” culture, the predominately young black male persona. Gangsta life is glorified and with it death. Christopher Lane and Delbert Belton died because of it. Where are our leaders to hold young black men accountable? Where is our President to call out members of his own community to aim for higher standards, to shape up? Our leaders are hustlers and pimps. How can we expect them to want anyone in their community to strive for anything better? This is a tweet from Jesse Jackson himself about the Christopher Lane murder. Praying for the family of Chris Lane. This senseless violence is frowned upon and the justice system must prevail. — Rev Jesse Jackson Sr (@RevJJackson) August 21, 2013 Jesse Jackson, you are the slime of humanity, a bigot to the core. Blood is dripping from your hands. This kind of violence is frowned upon? That’s all he has to say. He has nothing to say about the shameful condition of the black community. And how this is not the white man’s fault. We will never hear those words from the race baiters. They’ll continue to make worthless statements like this. This crime does not profit them. Delbert Belton’s death will be thought of no differently. All these men, and the ones after, will die in vain. They will die because blacks do not want to admit that their racism toward whites is deeper than anyone can imagine. And that the problems facing the black community today are not white people’s fault. by ||||| Once again a crime has become a flash-point in the ongoing examination of the role of race and age in contemporary American society. The victim this time was Delbert Belton, an 88-year-old World War II veteran who police say was beaten to death by two teenagers as he sat in his car outside an Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Wash. On Thursday, news of Belton's death the day before had reached a few corners of the Internet. By Friday, the tragedy had struck a national chord. Drudge Report carried the the story at the top of its page. CNN’s Jake Tapper interviewed Belton’s daughter-in-law on \\"The Lead.\\" The Fox News program \\"Special Report with Bret Baier\\" touted special coverage of Belton’s death. News outlets also reported that a 16-year-old boy had been arrested in connection with the killing and that authorities were seeking a second boy, also 16. And in multiple cities across the U.S., the hashtag #DelbertBelton was trending on Twitter. The flurry of social media shares and conversations was significant in lifting the story from a local to a national scale. One of the earliest – and most high-profile tweets regarding Belton’s death -- came from actor James Woods. #DelbertBelton. Please RT. Don't let him die without anyone caring. — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013 After coverage by national media outlets amped up, Woods thanked followers — and continued posting articles on Belton's killing, including a piece by Janna Brock that criticized the mainstream media for ignoring \\"the rampant, calculated attack on whites by blacks that have occurred recently.\\" If we are ACTIVE, the MSM will eventually wither in influence. Social media will provide a voice to be HEARD http://t.co/exh3fEPyeH — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013 Belton's killing prompted many comparisons to previous high-profile killings and responses to them, in particular, President Obama's response following the death of Trayvon Martin. Did you hear Obama condemn the murder of #DelbertBelton? of course not, he didn't say anything about it b/c victim was an old white man. — Wisdom for Women (@wisdomforwomen) August 23, 2013 Others noted the absence of civil rights activists' weighing in on Belton's death, implying hypocrisy or callousness on the part of the civil rights movement for neglecting to examine the circumstances surrounding the fatal beating. #DelbertBelton is looking to you Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson for the respect and concern you accorded Trayvon. What, Belton's not black? — David Garrison (@dlgarrison) August 24, 2013 Many tweets compressed animosity toward President Obama and admiration for Belton's military career in one tweet, with racial tension operating as a subtext. He survived WWII Wounds in Okinowa, but not Obama. RIP #DelbertBelton pic.twitter.com/QfaYkPoyhU — SMLBound (@SMLBound) August 23, 2013 Less dominant were observations that referenced the 72 years between the ages of the suspects and the victim — but the at-times folksy tweets about the paucity of respect for the aged was invoked as a sign of the times. A friend of #delbertbelton said it best: “You’re supposed to respect your elders, not beat them to death.” — Joe Thornton (@joethornton) August 23, 2013 And less inflammatory — but no less present — were those who portrayed Belton's death as the fault of society writ-large, saying that the responsibility for the beating was collective.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Robert Joseph Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal's elementary school, and was \\"immediately hooked\\". The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team. That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as \\"a fortunate event\\" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college. He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.

Article: Burke's last publications were the Letters on a Regicide Peace (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as appeasement, injurious to national dignity and honour. In his Second Letter, Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: \\"Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms\\". Question: What did Burke think was missing from the French Revolutionary Government?","completion":"Edmund Burke, in his Letters on a Regicide Peace, criticized the French Revolutionary Government for lacking the key element of individuality in their scheme of governance. He believed that the government was overly focused on generating and maintaining power through military force, rather than placing importance on the rights, liberties, and overall well-being of individual citizens. According to Burke, the French Revolutionary Government pursued dominion and conquest as its sole objectives, aiming to control minds through proselytism and bodies through the use of arms. This approach was fundamentally rooted in a military mindset, embracing principles, maxims, spirit, and movements that were inherently warlike and uncompromising. Burke was concerned that this style of governance would lead to a suppression of individual freedom and the erosion of the values that were necessary to preserve a just and democratic society. By neglecting the importance of individuality, the French Revolutionary Government, in Burke's view, undermined the very foundation upon which a functioning, stable, and prosperous state must be built. In essence, Burke argued that the French Revolutionary Government's disregard for individuality and its obsession with power and control would ultimately prove to be detrimental to the nation's dignity, honor, and overall well-being. He warned against appeasing such a system and its principles, as he considered this to be a threat not only to France but also to other nations that might consider following its example."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Luke Rowan, when he left the cottage, walked quickly back across the green towards Baslehurst. He had sauntered out slowly on his road from the brewery to Bragg's End, being in doubt as to what he would do when he reached his destination; but there was no longer room for doubt now; he had said that to Rachel's mother which made any further doubt impossible, and he was resolved that he would ask Rachel to be his wife. He had spoken to Mrs. Ray of his intention in that respect as though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be rejected, and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth; but he was eager, sanguine, and self-confident by nature, and though he was by no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom any young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved, he did not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with despair. He walked quickly home along the dusty road, picturing to himself a happy prosperous future in Baslehurst, with Rachel as his wife, and the Tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income paid to old Tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery. That was his present solution of the brewery difficulty. Tappitt was growing old, and it might be quite as well not only for himself, but for the cause of humanity in Devonshire, that he should pass the remainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement from business affords. He did not desire Tappitt for a partner any more than Tappitt desired him.

For example, they might mention predictable plot developments, flat characters, or unrealistic dialogue.

Answer the following question: Information: - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters. - Star Warrior is a 1980 science fiction role - playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations ( later known as Epyx ) for the Apple II , TRS - 80 , and Atari home computers . The game was branded as part of the Starquest series , consisting of Star Warrior and the otherwise unrelated Rescue at Rigel . - Jon Freeman was an influential computer game industry figure of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was a co-founder of Epyx and Free Fall Associates and the spouse of game programmer Anne Westfall. Besides founding these two companies, though he is credited with some programming, Freeman is most noted as a game designer. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores.

Write a summary based on this article: Ottawa - April 16, 2014 – The RCMP’s National Division Integrated Technological Crime Unit (ITCU) has charged a 19 year old London, Ontario man in relation to the malicious breach of taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website. Stephen Arthuro Solis-Reyes was arrested at his residence on April 15 without incident. He faces one count of Unauthorized Use of Computer and one count of Mischief in Relation to Data contrary to Sections 342.1(1)(a) and 430(1.1) of the Criminal Code. It is believed that Solis-Reyes was able to extract private information held by the CRA by exploiting the security vulnerability known as the Heartbleed Bug. “The RCMP treated this breach of security as a high priority case and mobilized the necessary resources to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. Investigators from National Division, along with our counterparts in “O” Division have been working tirelessly over the last four days analyzing data, following leads, conducting interviews, obtaining and executing legal authorizations and liaising with our partners,” said Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud. A search was conducted at the suspect’s residence and computer equipment was seized. The success of this investigation reflects the collaborative efforts of the RCMP and other government agencies as well as the London Police Service. Solis-Reyes is scheduled to appear in court in Ottawa on July 17, 2014. This investigation was conducted as part of the ITCU ’s mandate to investigate pure computer crimes where the Federal Government and/or Canadian critical IT infrastructure are victimized. National Division’s mandate is to focus its expertise in sensitive, high-risk investigations into significant threats to Canada’s political, economic and social integrity. The investigation is still ongoing. The RCMP is committed to advising Canadians of any significant developments in this case. - 30 - Contact: Cpl.

The national police force acted quickly, stating that it received information on the alleged breach last Friday. In a statement Wednesday, the RCMP's national division said it has arrested Stephen Arthuro Solis-Reyes, 19, of London, Ont., and charged him with one count of unauthorized use of a computer and one count of mischief in relation to data.

A computer was seized at the suspect's residence. Mr. Solis is a second-year student at the University of Western Ontario. In 2012, he graduated from a London high school, Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary. He was part of a team from his secondary school that came first in a programming competition at the London District Catholic School Board. He is also the creator of a BlackBerry phone app that solves Sudoku puzzles, which was released while he was still in high school. Mr. Solis is the son of a UWO computer science professor, Roberto Solis-Oba. Before moving to London, the family lived in Lafayette, Ind., where the elder Mr. Solis obtained a PhD in computer science at Purdue University. Prof. Solis didn't answer an e-mailed request for comment. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement The arrest came after the CRA said Monday that about 900 social insurance numbers were stolen from its servers. The CRA had shut down all of its public online services because of the Heartbleed Internet bug. The CRA statement was one of the first disclosures by an organization that it had lost data to someone exploiting the vulnerability. However, the government has also come under fire for its handling of the threat and the speed with which it has acted to contain the problem. \\"There are many questions about the response and the timing of the response,\\" NDP MP Charlie Angus said in an interview. \\"We see a pattern with this government, which is to protect the minister rather than protect the interests of Canadians.\\" The CRA won't say when the breach occurred: during the two years in which the bug went undetected, or during the 24-hour gap between the public revelation of Heartbleed's existence and the CRA's shutdown of its websites last week. The CRA also declined to explain how it determined which SINs were hacked, since Heartbleed intrusions are hard to detect. Internet security expert Mark Nunnikhoven previously told The Globe and Mail that the breach was probably detected through network monitoring from one of the federal government's agencies dealing with Internet security, such as Shared Services Canada or even the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). While a Heartbleed breach would have left no traces of a data leak on the logs of CRA servers, it would have been spotted by network-monitoring tools that capture and analyze transiting data packets, he said. |||||","completion":"In April 2014, a 19-year-old man from London, Ontario, was arrested and charged in relation to a malicious data breach from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website.

A:","completion":"Both Edgar Cayce and Paul Solomon believed in the existence of the lost city of Atlantis. Atlantis is a legendary, ancient civilization that is said to have existed thousands of years ago. The story of Atlantis has captivated the minds of people for centuries and has become a part of popular culture and folklore. Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) was an American clairvoyant and is often referred to as the \\"sleeping prophet.\\" He conducted thousands of psychic readings, many of which were related to health and healing, but some also touched upon historical and spiritual topics. Among his numerous readings, Cayce claimed that the lost city of Atlantis was an advanced civilization that existed around 10,000 BC in the Atlantic Ocean. According to Cayce, the Atlanteans possessed advanced technology, spiritual knowledge, and psychic abilities. He stated that the city was destroyed in a series of catastrophic events involving both natural disasters and human actions that caused it to sink beneath the ocean. Similarly, Paul Solomon (1939-1994) was an American spiritual teacher, psychic, and healer who also claimed to have knowledge about the lost city of Atlantis. In his readings and teachings, Solomon shared beliefs similar to those of Edgar Cayce about the existence of this ancient civilization. For instance, he agreed on the location of Atlantis being in the Atlantic Ocean and spoke about the advanced capabilities of its inhabitants. Solomon also believed that the Atlanteans had extensive knowledge of energy sources and spiritual wisdom which enabled them to build magnificent structures. It is important to note that there is no concrete evidence to prove the existence of Atlantis; it remains a part of legend and speculation. While both Cayce and Solomon had dedicated followers who believed in their psychic abilities and the knowledge they shared regarding Atlantis, these claims are based on their personal experiences and visions rather than solid archaeological or scientific data. In conclusion, both Edgar Cayce and Paul Solomon believed in the lost city of Atlantis - an advanced ancient civilization which they claimed existed around 10,000 BC in the Atlantic Ocean. They both asserted that the Atlanteans had superior knowledge in various fields, including technology, spirituality, and psychic abilities, but ultimately faced destruction due to catastrophic events.

They don’t mind talking about their personal life at work, but they hate talking about their work life when they are enjoying a weekend or vacation. But with blackberries and laptops, white people could be working anywhere, at any time. So how do you know when they are off the clock? It’s easy, check their clothes. When white people aren’t working, they generally like to wear Outdoor Performance Clothes. The top suppliers of these garments and accessories include North Face, REI, Mountain Equipment Co-Op, Columbia Sportswear, and Patagonia. When you see white people wearing these, it is important that you do not discuss business matters. Instead you should say things like “where did you get that fleece?” and “what’s that thing holding your keys to your shorts?” White people will be more than happy to talk to you about their sustainably produced possessions. The main reason why white people like these clothes is that it allows them to believe that at any moment they could find themselves with a Thule rack on top of their car headed to a national park. It could be 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday when they might get a call “hey man, you know what we need to do? Kayak then camping, right now. I’m on my way to get you, there is no time to change clothes.” Though it is unlikely that they will receive this call, White people hate the idea of missing an opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities because they weren’t wearing the right clothes. If you plan on spending part of your weekend with a white person, it is strongly recommended that you purchase a jacket or some sort of “high performance” t-shirt, which is like a regular shirt but just a lot more expensive. Advertisements ||||| The source. In the laundry, synthetic clothing sheds microscopic plastic fibers ( shown in the inset along with other plastic debris ) that make their way through sewage treatment systems and into oceans. There's nothing subtle about dryer lint: Clean the fluffy, gray mat off the filter or risk a fire. Washer lint, however, is sneaky. Nearly 2000 polyester fibers can float away, unseen, from a single fleece sweater in one wash cycle, a new study reports. That synthetic lint likely makes its way through sewage treatment systems and into oceans around the world. The consequences of this widespread pollution are still hazy, but environmental scientists say the microscopic plastic fibers have the potential to harm marine life. The existence of so-called microplastics in marine environments is not, in itself, a revelation. Larger bits of plastic, such as those in the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch, gradually break down into microscopic fragments. And minute plastic fibers have turned up before in treated sewage and on beaches. But no one had looked at the issue on a global scale, says ecologist Mark Browne of University College Dublin. So Browne and his team recruited far-flung colleagues on six continents to scoop sand from 18 beaches. (The scientists had to wear all natural-fiber clothing, lest their own garments shed lint into the samples.) Back in the lab, the researchers painstakingly separated the plastic from the sand—a process that involved, among other things, hand plucking microscopic fibers from filter papers. A chemical analysis showed that nearly 80% of those filaments were made of polyester or acrylic, compounds common in textiles. Not a single beach was free of the colorful synthetic lint. Each cup (250 milliliters) of sand contained at least two fibers and as many as 31. The most contaminated samples came from areas with the highest human population density, suggesting that cities were an important source of the lint. Cities come with sewers, and Browne's team thought the plastic fibers might enter the ocean via sewage. Sure enough, synthetic lint was relatively common in both treated wastewater and in ocean sediments from sites where sewage sludge had been dumped. In all the samples, the fibers were mainly polyester and acrylic, just like the ones from the beaches. Finally, the researchers wanted to see how synthetic lint got into sewage in the first place. Given its polyester-acrylic composition, they thought clothing and blankets were a good bet. So they purchased a pile of polyester blankets, fleeces, and shirts and commandeered three volunteers' home washing machines for several months. They collected the wastewater from the machines and filtered it to recover the lint. Each polyester item shed hundreds of fibers per washing, the team reports in the 1 November issue of Environmental Science and Technology. A polyester sweater may seem cozy and innocent on a winter day, but its disintegrated fibers could be bad news in marine environments, Browne says. Other studies have found that microplastics in the ocean absorb pollutants such as DDT. And Browne's own work has shown that filter-feeding mussels will consume tiny plastic particles, which then enter the animals' bloodstreams and even their cells. If the same thing happens in nature, the plastic fibers could \\"end up on our dinner plates,\\" incorporated into seafood, Browne warns. There is still no direct evidence that the fibers—pollutant-tainted or otherwise—harm marine life, but Browne says it's worth figuring out. He argues that the fibers are \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" and says that textile and washing machine manufacturers, as well as sewage treatment plants, should be looking for ways to keep the fibers out of the ocean. Garments that shed less lint, or filters that trap the fibers, might help. ScienceNOW sent a copy of the study to Patagonia, one popular maker of fleece sweaters. No one was able to review the study and comment before deadline, but spokesperson Jess Clayton said that Patagonia does intend to follow up on the findings with Polartec, its primary supplier of fleece. ||||| On Black Friday, outdoor retailer Patagonia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times asking readers to “buy less and to reflect before you spend a dime.” Beside a photo of their iconic fleece jacket, the headline read: “Don’t Buy This Jacket.” And, while their message about retail consumption undoubtedly made a splash, there may be yet another reason to take a pass on that cozy, modern outerware. Besides Patagonia’s confession that the process of creating the R2® Jacket leaves behind “two-thirds of its weight in waste” on its way to their Reno warehouse — it turns out that tossing the jacket in the washer causes it to leave behind something else entirely — thousands of tiny plastic threads. According to a study published in November’s Environmental Science and Technology, nearly 2,000 polyester fibers can shake loose from a single piece of clothing in the wash and, unfortunately, those tiny plastic bits are making their way into the ocean. Ecologist Mark Browne, University College Dublin, and several colleagues gathered sand samples from 18 beaches on six continents for analysis. It turns out that every beach tested contained microplastics (particles about the size of a piece of long grain of rice or smaller). Of the samples collected, nearly 80 percent were polyester or acrylic, though without further research, it’s impossible to know exactly which type of clothing — whether it’s your stretchy yoga pants or that super-soft fleece blanket — is causing the most problems. Currently, textile manufacturers are not required to test their fabrics for shedding. According to Science, “Not a single beach was free of the colorful synthetic lint. Each cup of sand contained at least two fibers and as many as 31. The most contaminated samples came from areas with the highest population density, suggesting cities were an important source of the lint.” Charles Moore, founder of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which focuses on plastics in the marine system, says he’s been concerned about microplastics from all sources, including those body scrub microbeads that are as ubiquitous as the multi-blade holiday Remington razor this time of year. What worries Moore most is where those microparticles may ultimately end up. Photo: epSos.de“Polyester is heavier than water and pollutes bottom sediments where most marine life lives,” he says. Once in the marine system, they get taken up by filter feeders like clams, mussels, and small fish like anchovies, sardines, etc., which are then eaten by larger fish. That concerns Browne too. His work with shellfish has shown that once ingested by animals, microplastic can be taken up and stored by tissues and cells. This bioaccumulation of pollutants can have negative consequences for wildlife and humans. Courtney Arthur, research coordinator with NOAA Marine Debris Program, says the issue is on NOAA’s radar, and expects research on microplastics and the effects on marine life to be a hot topic among scientists over the next few years. But for now, she says, the bottom line is still unclear. “We don’t know the extent of injury at this point. We do know some marine animals ingest plastics, even down to mollusks like mussels and clams. We know it’s possible they could be accumulating in the food chain,” says Arthur. “All spectrum of marine life has the potential to take in these small particles, but at this point, it’s hard to say how much harm is being done.” Although Browne and Arthur are cautious about making a direct link between microplastics and harm to marine life, there’s little disagreement that the recent increase in plastics pollution in the oceans is alarming. Several years ago, scientists discovered that plastics could break down at lower temperatures, leaking chemicals like Bisphenol A into the water. So just how do we prevent the problem from getting worse? Moore says the place to filter the microfibers out is at the washing machine, well before particles move through the wastewater system and eventually into the ocean. So we contacted the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers to see if the industry had the capability of filtering microparticles before they reach the wastewater stream. Although their spokesperson did speak with Grist, they did not get back to us with a statement. While Browne’s study focuses on the washing machine, Arthur also points out that simply wearing synthetic garments can also cause shedding. He hopes designers of clothing and washing machines will focus on ways to reduce the release of fibers, and says further research is needed to develop methods for removing microplastic from sewage. “Both government and industry need to work with us to determine the hazards natural and synthetic fibers pose for the health of humans and wildlife, so we can choose fibers that pose less of a risk,” says Browne. So with months of bone chilling weather ahead, are you willing to swap your super soft fleece for something more sustainable? We asked both Browne and Arthur if they still own synthetics, and both said yes. “I have some fleece, but with this type of research on our radar, I think twice before wearing it,” said Arthur.

The researchers collected sand samples from 18 beaches across six continents and discovered that each sample contained microplastics, with nearly 80% being polyester or acrylic. These microplastics can be consumed by marine life, leading to potential bioaccumulation of pollutants that could harm both wildlife and humans. The study's authors recommend that textile and washing machine manufacturers, as well as sewage treatment plants, should work towards keeping these fibers out of the ocean by developing garments that shed less lint and using filters that trap the fibers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and some other English speaking countries.

In non-rhotic areas the final R is silent unless the next word begins in a vowel. When \\"shire\\" is a suffix as part of a placename in England, the vowel is unstressed and thus usually shortened and/or monophthongised: pronunciations include , or sometimes , with the pronunciation of the final R again depending on rhoticity.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . and the situation: Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond.

Generate a question that has the following answer: telescope for the following movie plot: Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Senn (Justin Long) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language. The Robot informs Mala that the mysterious object is a generation ship called The Ark, containing humans from Earth. Centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed by humans and colonized. But 200 years later, the two planets demanded independence from Earth, which the Earth government refused to grant them due to the high demand of resources from the two colonies.

Desperately seeking peace and solitude from his previous chaotic life, he hopes to find solace in his new environment. However, not long after settling in, he starts experiencing bizarre visions of his neighbors playing soccer with a human head. Haunted by these horrific visions, Trelkovsky becomes paranoid and withdrawn. His work becomes increasingly macabre, reflecting the darkness that has pervaded his psyche since moving into his new home. As reality blurs with his imagination, he suspects there's more to his neighbors than meets the eye. Driven to the edge and tormented by the thought of a heinous crime committed in his complex, he begins an investigation to uncover the truth. Trelkovsky's relationship with his neighbors crumbles as his suspicions rise. Each interaction brings forth more questions, leading to disturbing discoveries about each resident - one is a disturbed war veteran, another a former psychiatrist with a troubled past, and a mysterious woman who has lived in the apartment for decades. With each revelation, Trelkovsky becomes more convinced that the human head is not just a figment of his imagination but a deeply rooted conspiracy among his neighbors. Lost in his obsession, Trelkovsky finally uncovers the truth behind his ghastly visions. The human head belongs to a previous tenant, a promising young soccer player murdered by a ruthless gambling syndicate. The neighbors, tormented by their sins, have kept it hidden for years, playing football with it as a twisted form of retribution. Their guilt-ridden and disturbed minds manifest as Trelkovsky's visions, a projection of their own troubled consciences.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

Article: Chilean miner Edison Pena plans to run the New York City Marathon on Sunday, less than a month after he was rescued from a collapsed mine that trapped him for 69 days. Pena ran 10 km daily through the mine's tunnels to beat the anxiety, wearing cut-down boots until rescuers sent him a pair of sports shoes through a narrow hole that served as the miners' \\"lifeline\\" to the surface. \\"When I ran in the darkness, I was running for life,\\" Pena told a news conference in New York. \\"I was running to show that I wasn't just waiting around. I also wanted God to see that I really wanted to live.\\" The New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, had invited Pena to be a guest at Sunday's race, but he said last week he did not want to watch, he wanted to run. \\"I was very eager to take on this big challenge,\\" he said. \\"I wanted to show the world I could run.\\" He hoped to run the 26.2-mile race in about six hours. \\"I have a knee injury, but I am eager to cross the finish line,\\" he said.

For example, the problem of factoring - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time . - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When punctuation began, it was mainly to help people read out loud. Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing. Since that point, all sorts of punctuation rules have been discovered and invented. Speech marks \\"...\\" Speech marks or quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking. The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined. Comma , colon: period(full stop). All three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium sized pause. Period meant a long pause. Exclamation mark! In the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \\"Oh, gosh!\\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed. Question mark?

Q:Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose the bacteria is virulent happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"A virulent bacterial infection could potentially have various impacts on the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream, depending on the severity and location of the infection, as well as how it affects the body's overall respiratory and circulatory functioning. When an individual is infected with virulent bacteria, the body's immune system is activated to combat the harmful pathogens, which may lead to inflammation and systemic responses such as fever and fatigue. As a result, the individual may experience an increase in the demand for oxygen throughout the body to maintain proper functioning and fight off the infection. Considering the process of oxygen exchange and circulation in the body, a virulent bacterial infection, particularly when it affects the respiratory system, might impact the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream in several ways: 1. Inflammation and congestion in the bronchial tubes and lungs: A respiratory infection caused by virulent bacteria can lead to inflammation and the production of excess mucus within the bronchial tubes and lungs. This can obstruct airways, making it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently exchanged between the inhaled air and the bloodstream. This would result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less). 2. Impaired alveoli function: The alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs where oxygen exchange occurs. If the virulent bacteria infect the lungs and cause damage to the alveoli, their ability to facilitate effective oxygen transportation to the bloodstream may be compromised. This would again result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less). 3. Reduced lung capacity and function: In some cases, a severe lung infection can lead to a reduction in lung capacity and overall function, making it harder for the individual to breathe and for proper oxygen exchange to occur. In such a scenario, the amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream would also be reduced (B: less). 4. Inability to oxygenate blood effectively: If the infection is of a nature that it directly affects the blood or the body's ability to generate red blood cells, which transport oxygen within the bloodstream, the individual's capacity to deliver an optimal amount of oxygen may be impacted. In this situation, the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream could be less (B: less). In conclusion, a virulent bacterial infection is most likely to result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less), due to factors like inflammation, congestion, impaired alveoli function, reduced lung capacity, or inability to effectively oxygenate the blood. However, it is important to note that the specific impact on oxygen delivery depends on the severity of the infection, the location within the body, and the individual's overall health status."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A senior White House official told CNN the discussion was \\"nearly an hour.\\" The White House, in a statement acknowledging the meeting, contended it was \\"brief\\" and said Trump spoke with Putin through Russia's translator. The US translator at the dinner -- each country was only allowed only one -- spoke Japanese, the White House said. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said no other staff were present for the discussion. The White House statement said the conversation took place in full view of other world leaders and their spouses at a dinner hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the G20 summit. Trump was seated near Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Abe's wife, while first lady Melania Trump was seated next to Putin. The White House said Trump went over to his wife and spoke with Putin near the dinner's end. The discussion came after their scheduled, two-hour-long bilateral meeting earlier that day. Russian President Vladimir Putin seen top right, next to US First Lady Melania Trump at a banquet during the G20 Summit in Hamburg. The White House, in its statement, sought to downplay the significance of the discussion. \\"It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president's duties, to interact with world leaders,\\" the statement said. The statement also disputed characterizing the discussion as a \\"second meeting,\\" but instead called it a \\"brief conversation.\\" Trump responded to reports of the meeting later Tuesday evening on Twitter. \\"Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \\"sick.\\" All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany.

'Only the Russians will have a transcript' US presidents at summits often hold private and impromptu discussions with other world leaders. However, the lack of immediate disclosure from the administration as well as Trump's own posture with regard to Russia raised significant questions following reports of the discussion having taken place. John Kirby, a CNN diplomatic and military analyst who was a spokesman for the State Department during the Obama administration, said smaller, informal meetings were common and were often where \\"heavy lifting\\" could get done. But he also pointed out potentially problematic aspects of the meeting. JUST WATCHED Tillerson says sanctions to remain on Russia Replay More Videos ...

Toward the end, the President spoke to Putin at the dinner.\\" \\"No staff or Cabinet were at the dinner at all, for any of the countries,\\" with the exception of translators, Anton said. Coons said Trump didn't bring a US translator and relied on Putin's, which the senator called a \\"basic failure in terms of national security protocol.\\" Asked if there was any depth to the conversation, Coons said there was no way to know. ||||| After his much-publicized two-and-a-quarter-hour meeting early this month with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Germany, President Trump chatted informally with the Russian leader for up to an additional hour later the same day. The second meeting, undisclosed at the time, took place at a dinner for G-20 leaders, a senior administration official said. At some point during the meal, Trump left his own seat to occupy a chair next to Putin. Trump approached alone, and Putin was attended only by his official interpreter. In a statement issued Tuesday night after published reports of the conversation, the White House said that “there was no ‘second meeting’ between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to ‘hide’ a second meeting,” it said, “is false, malicious and absurd.” “All the leaders” circulated around the room throughout the dinner, and “President Trump spoke with many leaders,” the statement said. “As the dinner was concluding,” it said, Trump spoke “briefly” with Putin, who was seated next to first lady Melania Trump. The dinner conversation with Putin was first reported Monday by Ian Bremmer, president of the New York-based Eurasia Group, in a newsletter to group clients. Bremmer said the meeting began “halfway” into the meal and lasted “roughly an hour.” The senior administration official said it began with the dessert course, but did not comment on its length. (The Washington Post) Pool reporters covering Trump noted that his and Putin’s motorcades were among the last to leave the event, departing within minutes of each other just before midnight. Trump lashed out at the media for reporting on his undisclosed meeting with Putin, saying the “fake news” was “sick” and “dishonest.” But the president distorted what news outlets, including The Washington Post, had reported, saying the story was about a “secret dinner” when in fact it was reported as an undisclosed meeting with Putin at a dinner of the G-20 leaders and their spouses. Trump also incorrectly stated that journalists knew about his meeting with Putin; in fact, they did not until Tuesday, when the White House confirmed that the two presidents met during the dinner. In the first of two tweets, Trump wrote: “Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is ‘sick.’ All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!” Trump then tweeted, “The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!” The dinner encounter appeared to underscore the extent to which Trump was eager throughout the summit to cultivate a friendship with Putin. During last year’s election campaign, he spoke admiringly of the Russian leader and at times seemed captivated by him. Meeting each other face-to-face for the first time at the Hamburg summit, the two presidents seemed to have a chemistry in their more formal bilateral session, evidenced by the fact that, despite being scheduled for 35 minutes, it continued for more than two hours. View Graphic How the Trump administration changed American foreign policy But Trump’s newly revealed conversation with Putin at the G-20 dinner is likely to stoke criticism — including perhaps from some fellow Republicans in Congress — that he is too cozy with the leader of a major U.S. adversary. Putin’s official interpreter provided the only Russian-English interpretation, the White House statement said, because the president was seated next to the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “Each couple was allowed one translator,” it said. “The American translator accompanying President Trump spoke Japanese.” The only version of the conversation provided to White House aides was that given by Trump himself, said the administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity before the White House statement was issued. Reporters traveling with the White House were not informed during the trip, and there was no formal readout of the chat. The official Trump-Putin meeting, earlier in the day, led to confusion over whether Trump agreed, as Putin later implied, to accept the Kremlin’s denial of any wrongdoing regarding interference in last year’s election. That meeting was attended by the leaders and their two interpreters, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Tillerson later said Trump twice asked Putin if the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had meddled in the race were true, and Putin twice denied it, so they moved on to other subjects of importance to the bilateral relationship, including Syria. Russia’s activities during the election, along with allegations that members of Trump’s campaign may have coordinated with Kremlin attempts to tilt the race in Trump’s direction, are the subject of investigations in Congress and by a special counsel. In Trump’s own account of the formal meeting, he repeated earlier comments that another country might have been responsible for cyber-interference in the election. “I’m not saying it wasn’t Russia. What I’m saying is that we have to protect ourselves no matter who it is,” he told reporters on Air Force One as he returned from a visit to France last week. “You know, China is very good at this,” Trump said. “I hate to say it, North Korea is very good at this.” Trump also said that Putin was unlikely to have preferred him over Hillary Clinton as president, since his goals include taking international energy business away from Russia and building up the U.S. military. The dinner at the G-20 summit, held July 7-8, occurred hours after Trump and Putin’s lengthy formal meeting. Leaders and their spouses were invited to a musical performance at Hamburg’s riverside concert venue, followed by an intimate dinner at which they were seated next to the spouse of one of their counterparts, rather than their own. Melania Trump was seated next to Putin. Trump, who is among the newest world leaders in the G-20, remained at the dinner for the entire night. He was among the last to leave — after the host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had already departed. Pool reporters with the president saw Putin’s motorcade leave at 11:50 p.m., followed shortly by Trump, who departed the concert hall at 11:54 p.m. Leaders who witnessed the meeting were “bemused, nonplussed, befuddled” by the animated conversation, held in full view — but apparently not within listening distance — of others present, Bremmer said by telephone. He said he spoke with two participants at the dinner. One senior European official whose head of government was there played down the attention the Trump-Putin chat garnered, saying it was not unusual for leaders to circulate or “withdraw to a corner” at such private gatherings. “Part of the rationale is the flurry of bilateral contacts that happen,” the official said. “I don’t find it a sensation,” he said of the lengthy dinner chat, although “maybe Trump and Putin are a little different” from other attendees. The administration official said there was nothing unusual in a meeting with no aides present, noting that Trump met alone with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and held a one-on-one session, with no aides present, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a second, previously undisclosed conversation during a dinner for G20 leaders at a summit earlier this month in Germany, a White House official confirmed on Tuesday. The two leaders held a formal two-hour bilateral meeting on July 7 in which Trump later said Putin denied allegations that he directed efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The White House official did not say how long the second meeting took place or what was discussed. The second conversation between Trump and Putin took place during a dinner for the Group of 20 heads of state and their spouses in Hamburg, said Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, who was first to report the meeting in a note to clients. Television coverage of the dinner showed that first lady Melania Trump was seated next to Putin. Bremmer said Trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking “privately and animatedly” with Putin, “joined only by Putin’s own translator.” The lack of a U.S. translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a “breach of national security protocol.” Trump is under intense scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election, and probing whether Trump’s campaign had ties to the activity. Trump has denied collusion between his campaign and Moscow. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"U.S. President Donald Trump had an undisclosed one-on-one discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 leaders’ dinner in Hamburg, according to the White House. The conversation occurred the same day as their formal, two-hour long bilateral meeting and was conducted through Putin's translator, as the US translator spoke only Japanese. The meeting has been called into question due to the lack of a US translator or other staff present, which leaves the US without a record of what was discussed - only Russia will have a transcript. Trump has responded furiously to accusations in the press, claiming that media stories of a \\"secret dinner\\" were \\"sick\\" and \\"dishonest\\" on Twitter. Reports suggest the meeting underscored Trump's attempts to cultivate a relationship with Putin, which may attract criticism due to ongoing investigations into potential undue Russian influence in the most recent US presidential elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please add spaces between words: 8CompleteabilitytounderstandJapaneseTVandnewspapers.","completion":"8 Complete ability to understand Japanese TV and newspapers. The ability to completely understand Japanese TV and newspapers involves developing and honing multiple language skills, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Accomplishing this task will require dedication, practice, and a strong learning regimen. Here is a detailed breakdown of the necessary steps to achieve this level of fluency: 1. Learn the Japanese writing systems: First, familiarize yourself with the three Japanese writing systems - Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Start by learning Hiragana and Katakana, which are phonetic alphabets and lay the foundation for the more complex Kanji characters. Once you have mastered Hiragana and Katakana, begin gradually learning Kanji characters, focusing on the most common ones used in daily life. 2. Acquire essential vocabulary: Build your vocabulary by learning basic Japanese words and phrases, often referred to as 'core words.' This will help you recognize essential terms when reading newspapers and watching TV. Flashcards or digital language apps can be handy tools for memorizing new words. 3. Grammatical knowledge: Japanese grammar is different from English, so understanding its structure is crucial for achieving fluency. Study sentence patterns and the proper use of particles, such as は, が, and を. Familiarize yourself with the various verb forms and conjugations as well. 4. Practice listening and reading: Increase your exposure to the Japanese language by regularly watching Japanese TV programs, movies, and news broadcasts. Additionally, read Japanese newspapers, articles, and books to familiarize yourself with the written form. Make use of resources like NHK Easy News, which contains simplified news articles for Japanese language learners. 5. Writing practice: Develop your writing skills by keeping a daily journal in Japanese, engaging in online forums, or exchanging messages with language exchange partners. This will help you gain confidence in constructing sentences and expressing your thoughts in Japanese. 6. Conversation practice: Strengthen your speaking skills by attending language exchanges, taking conversation lessons with native Japanese speakers, or participating in online language exchange communities. The more you practice speaking, the more natural it will become. 7. Develop specialized knowledge: Understanding Japanese TV and newspapers may involve becoming familiar with specialized words and phrases related to politics, economics, sports, etc. Read up on current events to expand your vocabulary and keep up with the topics commonly covered in newspapers and TV news. 8. Cultural understanding: Gaining proficiency in the Japanese language is not just about learning the words and grammar rules; it is essential to understand the cultural context. Immerse yourself in Japanese culture by learning about local customs, traditions, and pop culture to better understand and appreciate the content you encounter in TV and newspapers. By following these steps and consistently dedicating time and effort to your studies, you can develop the complete ability to understand Japanese TV and newspapers. This process may be challenging, but with persistence and dedication, you will achieve this level of fluency. Remember that even native speakers continuously refine their language skills, so continued practice and learning will be essential for maintaining and improving your proficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While you are taking your dog to the vet or animal hospital, apply pressure with a clean bandage or towel. If there is a foreign object in the wound, do not try to remove it yourself. If the wound is not severe or bleeding quickly, you will likely have time to dress it before seeking vet help. If the wound is so minor that the dog is not scratching at it or paying attention to it, you may not even have to dress it. Just go straight to the vet. If the blood from the wound is coming out in spurts or is bright red, this could indicate arterial bleeding. Such bleeding can be life-threatening. Apply pressure to the wound and seek immediate help. Ask someone to help keep the dog in place so you can bandage the wound and wrap the shoulder. The dog should be standing so you can wrap the bandage under the dog's torso. If the dog is in pain, it may snap or bite. Even a typically calm dog can bite out of fear when hurt. To avoid this, consider using a muzzle or having someone gently but firmly hold the dog's head and neck forward while you dress the wound. If possible, before you wrap the wound try to gently clean it with a saline solution and a clean gauze or cotton pad. You do not need to extensively clean the wound at this moment. Simply flush out the opening with the solution. Dab the wound gently with clean cotton gauze. Then cut a cotton bandage to fit the size of the wound and place it directly on the open wound. Press down firmly with 1 hand to slow any bleeding. Consider wearing gloves to prevent introducing germs to the wound.","completion":"In the case of a dog sustaining a significant cut or profusely bleeding wound, it is essential to seek immediate veterinary assistance.

If the wound is not severe or rapidly bleeding, there may be time to dress it before acquiring professional help. For minor wounds that the dog does not pay attention to, dressing it may not be necessary, and one should proceed straight to the vet. When blood spurts or appears bright red, this could signify arterial bleeding, which is potentially fatal. In such cases, apply pressure to the wound and obtain prompt help.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: Coming off their bye week, the Seahawks flew to Giants Stadium for a Week 5 duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as QB Eli Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Domenik Hixon. The Seahawks responded with kicker Olindo Mare completing a 30-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 3-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead with kicker John Carney getting a 29-yard field goal, Jacobs getting a 1-yard TD run, and Carney making a 33-yard field goal. Seattle closed out the half with Mare kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York pulled away as Manning completed a 23-yard TD pass to WR Sinorice Moss, along with Carney nailing a 35-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants sealed the win as QB David Carr completed a 5-yard TD pass to Moss. How many yards longer was Carney's average yards of field goals than Mare's average yards of field goals?","completion":"Let's first find out the total yards of field goals each player scored and how many field goals each player scored. John Carney scored field goals of 29 yards, 33 yards, and 35 yards. Adding these gives a total of 29 + 33 + 35 = 97 yards. He scored 3 field goals. Olindo Mare scored field goals of 30 yards and 29 yards. Adding these gives a total of 30 + 29 = 59 yards. He scored 2 field goals. Now we need to find their average yards of field goals: - Carney's average yards: 97 yards / 3 field goals = 32.33 yards per field goal (rounded) - Mare's average yards: 59 yards / 2 field goals = 29.5 yards per field goal Finally, subtract Mare's average from Carney's average: 32.33 - 29.5 = 2.83 So, Carney's average yards of field goals were 2.83 yards longer than Mare's average yards of field goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: * Decide on the shape and size of your bench, purchase wood, cut to size, screw together, stain wood, and install in your garden.. * Decide on the shape and size of your bench, purchase wood, stain wood, cut to size, screw together, and install in your garden..","completion":"I choose the first option: Decide on the shape and size of your bench, purchase wood, cut to size, screw together, stain wood, and install in your garden. Here's how I would do it step-by-step: 1. Decide on the shape and size of the bench: Before starting the project, it's essential to determine the desired shape and size of the garden storage bench. Consider the space available in the garden, as well as the intended use and storage capacity of the bench. 2. Purchase wood: Based on the decided shape and size, calculate the amount and type of wood required for the project. Select the appropriate wood type, such as pressure-treated lumber, cedar, or other outdoor-friendly wood options. Purchase the necessary wood from a local hardware store or lumberyard. 3. Cut the wood to size: Using the dimensions determined in step 1, cut the wood to the required lengths using a circular saw, jigsaw, or handsaw. Don't forget to measure and mark the wood pieces before cutting to ensure accuracy. 4. Screw the pieces together: Lay out the wood pieces according to the design of the bench. Pre-drill holes to avoid splitting the wood, and use weather-resistant screws to join the pieces together. Assemble the frame, seat, and backrest, followed by attaching the storage compartment or hinges for the storage area. 5. Stain or seal the wood: Once the bench is fully assembled, clean any sawdust or debris from its surface. Apply a coat of high-quality, weather-resistant wood stain or sealer to protect the bench from moisture, UV rays, and potential damage. Follow the product's instructions for application and drying time. 6. Install the bench in your garden: Place the completed garden storage bench in its designated location within the garden. Ensure the bench is stable on level ground, and secure it if necessary. By following these steps, you will successfully create a beautiful and functional garden storage bench. The first option provides a logical sequence of steps, allowing the wood to be cut accurately and assembled before applying the stain. If the wood were stained before cutting and assembling, there would likely be inconsistencies in the finish due to additional sawing and handling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Frida begins just before the traumatic accident Frida Kahlo suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live action scene with actors. Frida also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the muralist Diego Rivera. When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera. The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two. Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky, who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his Coyoacán home.

What is the best way to: To cheaply sand curves with sandpaper. Available options: I. Wrap the sandpaper around a toy drum for a drum sander.; II. Wrap the sandpaper around a cylinder for a drum sander.; Answer:","completion":"Answer: II. Wrap the sandpaper around a cylinder for a drum sander. Step 1: Choose a suitable cylinder Select a cylinder that matches the size and shape of the curves you want to sand. This could be a piece of PVC pipe, a wooden dowel, or even an empty plastic bottle, depending on the size of the curved surface. Step 2: Cut the sandpaper Cut the sandpaper into strips that are the same width as the cylinder's circumference. Make sure the sandpaper's grit is appropriate for the material you're sanding and the stage of sanding (coarser grit for initial sanding, finer grit for finishing). Step 3: Attach the sandpaper to the cylinder Wrap the sandpaper strip around the cylinder, ensuring that it covers the entire circumference. Secure the sandpaper in place with some tape or rubber bands. If the sandpaper strip is not long enough to cover the entire surface, you can attach multiple strips end-to-end to ensure full coverage. Step 4: Sand the curved surface Hold the cylinder with the sandpaper end against the curvy surface, applying even pressure as you sand. Move the cylinder back and forth in a smooth, controlled motion, following the curve's contour. Make sure to sand in the direction of the wood grain (if applicable) to avoid damage to the material. Step 5: Inspect and repeat if necessary After sanding, inspect the curve to check if the desired smoothness is achieved. If necessary, repeat the process with finer grit sandpaper to achieve a smoother finish. Using a cylinder for a drum sander in this method is cost-effective and versatile, as you can select a suitable cylinder based on the size of the curves being sanded and easily replace the sandpaper as needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Whenever Bill visited Tim's house, they couldn't see that many stars when stargazing . Tim lived in the city. The sky was much clearer at night at Bill's place, because he lived in a rural area. But I can use this background: Astronomy is very sensitive to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what can be seen from dark skies.[78] Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere at night) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. What is an answer for this question: Where do they see more stars and galaxies, at Tim's or at Bill's? Answer:","completion":"Bill and Tim are both interested in stargazing and observing the night sky. However, the quality of their stargazing experience greatly depends on the amount of light pollution in their respective locations. In this case, Tim lives in the city, while Bill resides in a rural area. Astronomy is indeed highly sensitive to light pollution, as mentioned in the provided background information. When one observes the night sky from a city, the view drastically differs from what can be seen in a dark, rural environment. Skyglow, which refers to the scattering of light in the atmosphere at night, is a key factor in causing this difference. It diminishes the contrast between stars, galaxies, and the night sky, making it more challenging to see faint celestial objects. As telescopes become more advanced, they are often built in increasingly remote locations to minimize the effects of light pollution, thus allowing for clearer and more detailed observations of the sky. This fact further emphasizes the impact that light pollution can have on stargazing and astronomical research. Considering the given information, we can conclude that Bill and Tim would see more stars and galaxies at Bill's place, which is located in a rural area. The lower levels of light pollution and reduced skyglow in this setting allow for a clearer view of the night sky, enabling them to observe fainter celestial objects more easily. In contrast, Tim's city residence would be subjected to much higher levels of light pollution, significantly hindering their stargazing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Da das komplette Programm für Bogen- und Rollenoffsetmaschinen getrennt durchlaufen werden muss, sind knapp zwei Tage anzusetzen, wenn mit beiden Maschinentypen gearbeitet wird. Translate to English English:","completion":"Since the complete program for sheet-fed and web offset presses must be run separately, it takes almost two full days when working with both types of machines. In more detail, the process of using sheet-fed and web offset printing machines requires careful planning and execution, as the two types of machines operate on distinct principles and their capabilities differ from one another. Sheet-fed offset presses are designed to print on individual sheets, whereas web offset presses print on rolls of paper or other continuous web materials. Given that a complete program for both types of machines must be followed separately, it's important to allocate sufficient time for each. Two full days should provide ample time for operators to become acquainted with and effectively use both sheet-fed and web offset printing machines. During these two days, operators should familiarize themselves with the processes and machinery, ensuring that they thoroughly understand how each machine type functions. This includes learning the specific techniques and settings unique to each press type and becoming proficient in their operation and maintenance. Furthermore, the operators should use this time to perfect their skills in managing the various printing parameters, such as ink usage, plate handling, registration, and drying. In addition to mastering the operation of each press type, the operators must also learn to switch between the two machines, as necessary. This may involve coordinating with other team members to ensure a seamless transition between sheet-fed and web offset printing jobs. In summary, while the complete program for sheet-fed and web offset presses must be run separately, dedicating almost two full days of training allows operators to efficiently and effectively work with both types of machines.

Several years ago the Navy kept a studied distance away from the making of \\"Men of Honor,\\" a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism. Ever eager to support films showing our Navy's best side the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers, with supporting shore installations, were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage. Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.S.S. Belleau Wood. Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington's director's debut in which he stars as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.S.S. Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front line helicopter assault platform. Fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men. Sent to the M.D. as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality. The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named Cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers, however painful, in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior. While all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the Oscar for gut-churning brutality. Films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all that transference and counter-transference stuff) but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping. It's a good story, well told. Period. While set in the Navy, \\"Antwone Fisher\\" is not in any real sense a service story as was \\"Men of Honor,\\" an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person. Nor is it truly a film about blacks. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still \\"standing tall.\\" The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor. My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander. With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as \\"Mister.\\" Not a big criticism, is it? :) I don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters.

In the text, the Twitter user talks about two different books: \\"Whistling for Elephants\\" and \\"Great Apes\\". They also mention they cried as a result of being hormonal, but they don't specify it was because they found the books distressing or negative. The mention of crying might initially indicate a negative sentiment, but in literature and film critique, intense emotional reactions such as crying are not necessarily negative. Readers often describe books that make them feel intense emotions as compelling, poignant, or touching. These kinds of emotions can make the experience of reading the book more immersive and memorable, contributing to a positive overall impression. Moreover, the Twitter user said that they \\"liked\\" the second book they mention, \\"Great Apes\\". This shows clear positive sentiment. They're comparing the two books they have mentioned, highlighting that they are \\"v. diff\\" or very different from each other. However, this contrast doesn't necessarily imply a negative sentiment towards either book. Instead, it offers more of a commentary about their distinctness. Given these observations, it's fair to interpret the overall sentiment of the tweet as positive. The user seems to have been emotionally engaged by \\"Whistling for Elephants\\" and expressed a liking for \\"Great Apes\\", suggesting overall positive experiences with both books. In analyzing sentiment, it's important to consider the full context and not focus on individual words or phrases.

Photosensitivity refers to an increased sensitivity to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays, which triggers an abnormal reaction in the skin or eyes. This can result in rashes, redness, irritation, and itching. In some cases, individuals might even be at risk of developing sunburn, a painful inflammation of the skin caused by overexposure to UV radiation. Moreover, people with lighter skin tones are more prone to sunburns and skin damage due to the lack of melanin, a pigment that provides natural protection against the sun's harmful rays. In contrast, individuals with darker skin tones have more melanin and, on the whole, may be less susceptible to sunburns, although they can still experience skin damage from excessive sun exposure. It's essential that people are mindful of their skin type and how they react to the sun's rays in order to ensure they are taking the appropriate precautions, such as wearing sunscreen, sunglasses, and protective clothing and limiting their exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours. Personalized precautions and awareness about sunlight exposure can help minimize the risk of sunburns and long-term skin damage while promoting optimal health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The Pregones Theater, which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002.

Please answer the following question: Information: - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\". - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Kobeliaky is a city in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine. Population is . - Kobeliatskyi Raion ( Ukrainian : ; translit . : Kobeliats'kyi Raion ) is a raion ( district ) in the central Ukrainian province of Poltava . The raion 's administrative center is the city of Kobeliaky , which has a separate administrative status within the oblast ' . Important rivers within the Kobeliatskyi Raion include the Dnieper and Vorskla rivers . The raion was officially founded on March 7 , 1923 . - A school district is a form of special-purpose district which serves to operate local public primary and secondary schools, for formal academic or scholastic teaching, in various nations. - A district is a type of administrative division that, in some countries, is managed by local government. Across the world, areas known as \\"districts\\" vary greatly in size, spanning entire regions or counties, several municipalities, subdivisions of municipalities, school district, or political district. - A raion (also rayon) is a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states (such as part of an oblast). The term is from the French \\"\\"rayon\\"\\" (meaning \\"honeycomb, department\\"), which is both a type of a subnational entity and a division of a city, and is commonly translated in English as \\"district\\". - The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the 15 independent states that emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its dissolution in December 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership. - Poltava Oblast (translit. \\"Poltavska oblast\\"; also referred to as Poltavshchyna \\"\\") is an oblast (province) of central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Poltava. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

In this case, let's break down both premise and hypothesis to ensure that they accurately match: 1. Premise: Two men in black bulletproof vests. Hypothesis: two guys in black vests. In the premise, we have \\"two men\\" while in the hypothesis, we have \\"two guys.\\" The terms \\"men\\" and \\"guys\\" here can be considered synonymous, so this part of the premise aligns with the hypothesis. However, there's a slight discrepancy in referring to the vests. The premise explicitly states that the vests are \\"bulletproof,\\" while the hypothesis only mentions \\"black vests.\\" It is important to include the aspect of the vests being bulletproof since it provides more information and context about the scene. To accurately represent the premise, the hypothesis should be modified to: \\"Two guys in black bulletproof vests\\" 2. Premise: They watch something taking place to the right of the picture. Hypothesis: look at something to the right. The premise describes the action of the two men as \\"watching\\" something happening to the right of the picture. In the hypothesis, this action is described as \\"looking\\" at something to the right.

To better understand the sentiment, let's break down the components of the tweet. 1. \\"too late\\": The phrase \\"too late\\" can convey a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction due to something that has already happened or cannot be undone. In this tweet, it could be interpreted as a negative sentiment, suggesting that the person missed an opportunity or event. 2. \\"::crying::\\": The user utilizes the shorthand \\"::crying::\\", which can be understood as an emoticon or symbolism for expressing sadness or disappointment, indicating that the user is upset about whatever incident they referred to as \\"too late.\\" This intensifies the perception of negativity connected to the disappointment they're illustrating. 3. \\"j/k\\": Following the \\"::crying::\\" emotion, the user then indicates \\"j/k\\", short for \\"just kidding.\\" This abbreviation is used to express that the preceding statement was not meant to be taken seriously and was meant to be humorous or sarcastic.

Premise: Time 's education cover package says parents should get their kids reading at an early age, be involved in their schools, not castigate them for mistakes, let them find their own learning styles, and praise hard work and persistence--not just outcomes. Hypothesis: Positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis that \\"positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development\\" is entailed by the premise provided. Let us break down the premise, connecting each of its components to the hypothesis. 1. Time's education cover package says parents should get their kids reading at an early age: This statement supports the idea that early learning is valuable in childhood development. Introducing children to the process of reading at a young age can provide them with critical language skills, literacy, and cognitive development. By familiarizing kids with reading from the start, it lays the groundwork for continuing development and educational growth in their formative years. 2. Be involved in their schools: The premise supports parents' active involvement in schools, implying that parental engagement enhances childhood development. When parents are involved, they can provide additional encouragement, support, and guidance that complement the educational infrastructure, essentially fortifying the learning experience. 3. Not castigate them for mistakes: The premise urges parents to avoid punishing their children for their errors. This idea highlights that positive reinforcement is an essential aspect of childhood development. Instead of focusing on the negative, parents should help children learn from their mistakes and transform their experiences into opportunities for growth and improvement. 4. Let them find their own learning styles: Acknowledging individual learning styles underscores the importance of personalization in childhood education. By helping kids discover the most effective methods and approaches, parents and educators can better cater to the child's unique learning needs. This principle connects to the hypothesis in that it promotes an understanding of the value of tailoring education to the individual child, leading to a more fruitful developmental experience. 5. Praise hard work and persistence—not just outcomes: The premise promotes praising effort and tenacity as opposed to merely focusing on the end results. By putting emphasis on the process rather than the outcome, parents and educators nurture resilience, curiosity, and motivation in children. This concept of emphasizing on the journey rather than the destination aligns with the hypothesis, as it demonstrates that positive reinforcement plays an integral role in childhood development. Based on these elements, it is clear that the hypothesis stating that positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development is indeed entailed by the premises provided. These ideas contribute to the overall well-being, resilience, and cognitive growth of children throughout their development both academically and emotionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane. A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned.

It's cheaper to buy ice cream than make it ourself. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"The product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. The reasons can be analyzed from multiple angles as detailed below: 1. Title and Initial Impression: The title of the review itself, \\"It's very bulky and more expensive than buying ice cream,\\" indicates that the reviewer was unhappy with their purchase. They have highlighted two of their primary concerns—bulkiness and cost. Using words like 'bulky' and 'more expensive' creates an immediate impression that the product did not meet the reviewer's expectations in terms of size and affordability. 2. Purpose Not Met: The reviewer had a specific goal in mind when purchasing the product—to make their own ice cream using raw milk. However, they mention that the amount of sugar and rock salt required was much more than anticipated. This highlights a discrepancy between the reviewer's expectations and the reality of using the product, which contributes to their negative sentiment. 3. Cost Comparison: The reviewer goes a step further in sharing their disappointment by comparing the costs of making ice cream versus buying it. They state that it is cheaper to buy pre-made ice cream than to make it themselves using the product. This point underlines the dissatisfaction they experienced, as their initial goal of using raw milk and potentially saving money or creating a healthier alternative was not achieved. 4. No Positive Aspects Mentioned: Another important aspect of this review is the absence of any positive remarks about the product. The reviewer focuses only on their dissatisfaction. If the sentiment were mixed or positive to some extent, we could expect some positive aspects or benefits to be mentioned. However, the absence of any positive remarks further solidifies the overall negative sentiment. In conclusion, the product review exhibits a negative sentiment due to the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the size, cost, and results of using the product for its intended purpose. Their cost comparison and the absence of any positive remarks emphasize their disappointment and solidify the negative sentiment conveyed."},{"prompt":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: 15 Minutes Movie plot: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser.

Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Tony has a Fiat to yearn for a tall nurse.","completion":"To determine if the given sentence is linguistically acceptable, let's analyze it step by step: 1. First, identify the main components of the sentence. The subject appears to be \\"Tony,\\" and the verb is \\"has.\\" The objects are \\"a Fiat\\" and \\"to yearn for a tall nurse.\\" 2. Next, consider whether the sentence structure is grammatically correct. At first glance, it seems to have proper syntax, with a subject, verb, and object(s). 3. Now, let's delve into the meaning of the sentence: \\"Tony has a Fiat to yearn for a tall nurse.\\" In this context, \\"to yearn for\\" usually indicates a strong desire. The mismatch lies in the fact that Tony's ownership of a Fiat somehow leads to him desiring a tall nurse. This connection is not made clear, which makes the sentence semantically unclear or confusing. As a result, although the sentence's structure is grammatically correct, its meaning is unclear, and its terminology is mismatched. This makes it linguistically less acceptable. A potential revision could be, \\"Tony has a Fiat, and he yearns for a tall nurse.\\" This revision separates the two ideas making them standalone thoughts and clarifies the sentence's meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two years before, she had abruptly ended their affair for reasons revealed later. Henry suspects Sarah is currently having an affair and is considering employing a private eye to investigate. Bendrix was jealous of Henry during his affair with Sarah and had tried to persuade her to leave him. If she has since started an affair with someone new after telling him there would never be anyone else, Bendrix wants to find out. Without telling Henry, he hires the investigator himself, at the same time as making arrangements to meet Sarah.Consistent with the tone of his diary, their meeting is cold and promises no future. Events are shown from Bendrix perspective, with contrasting flashbacks of Bendrix with Sarah as they began their affair during World War II. The present day action continues as Bendrix encounters the private investigator Parkis (Ian Hart), who uses his young son Lancelot (Sam Bould) to help him snoop. The boy has a birthmark that disfigures his face.Parkis reports that he has found who Sarah has been seeing under the pretence of attending dental appointments. Bendrix jealousy leads him to confront the man named Smythe, using Lancelot as a ploy to gain access to his home. Smythe (Jason Isaacs) is a priest who admits he knows Sarah and who Bendrix is.

Question 2: Is there a way to mute questions with certain keywords on Quora? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions are inquiring about the possibility to mute or filter out questions that contain specific text or keywords on the Q&A platform, Quora. To provide a detailed and long answer to address this inquiry, I will explain the current features and limitations of Quora's platform related to muting questions and suggest potential alternatives. Currently, Quora does not offer a built-in feature that allows users to mute or filter out questions based on specific text or keywords. The platform allows users to mute individual questions or topics, but not based on customized keywords. Here’s a brief explanation of these features: 1. Muting questions: When you come across a question on your feed or recommended questions that you are not interested in, you have the option to click on the three-dot icon next to the question and select \\"Mute.\\" This will prevent the question from appearing in your feed again. However, this has to be done manually for each question, and you cannot mute them based on keywords. 2. Muting topics: Quora also allows you to mute entire topics. To do this, go to the topic page, click on the three-dot icon next to the \\"Follow\\" button, and select \\"Mute.\\" Muting a topic will reduce the number of questions you see related to that topic in your feed. Again, this feature does not allow for keyword-based muting. While Quora's current muting options might be limited, you can still explore potential workarounds to enhance your Quora experience and avoid questions containing specific keywords. Here are some suggestions: 1. Customize your interests: You can edit your interests on Quora to include only the topics you genuinely care about. By following more relevant topics, you will receive questions and answers related to your preferences, reducing the chances of encountering undesired content. Click on your profile icon, select \\"Knows About,\\" and use the search bar to add or remove topics. 2. Use browser extensions: Some browser extensions or add-ons may be able to filter out specific keywords or phrases from your feed, essentially muting questions containing your selected text. Note that using such extensions may not be officially supported by Quora and could potentially lead to a less optimal experience on the platform. 3. Provide user feedback to Quora: While the keyword muting feature is currently not available, you can provide this feedback to Quora's team, expressing your desire for such a feature to be implemented. They may consider implementing it in future updates if they see value in it from a user experience standpoint. To sum up, questions 1 and 2 are indeed asking the same thing, and unfortunately, there is no built-in feature on Quora to mute questions containing specific text or keywords. However, by using the available muting options and customizing your interests, you may be able to filter out undesired content to a certain extent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When times get tough, we all look for ways to cut back. When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u We can learn from the passage that _ .

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area Answer:","completion":"The final step in this process, following the forest fires, decreased hiding places for animals, increased predation, and the departure of birds, is the ecological response and eventual recovery of the affected ecosystem. Following such a disturbance, the forest ecosystem goes through a series of changes, often called ecological succession, in order to reach a new stable state. This process can be broken down into various stages: 1. Initial colonization: After the forest fire, the affected area will be initially colonized by pioneer species – plants adapted to surviving in disturbed environments. These plants, such as grasses and small shrubs, grow rapidly in the exposed soil and take advantage of the increased sunlight and available nutrients. This stage helps to stabilize the soil, preventing erosion and further degradation. 2. Secondary succession: As the pioneer plants begin to grow and establish themselves, other species, such as larger shrubs and smaller trees, take root in the area. These plants provide additional habitat resources for animals to return to the area, creating a more diverse ecosystem. The increased plant cover helps to reduce soil erosion, eventually leading to improved soil quality. 3. Climax community formation: Over time, the ecosystem continues to develop and mature as more tree species take root and the plant community diversifies. The canopy grows taller, shading out some of the smaller plants and allowing for more shade-tolerant species to establish themselves. At this stage, the ecosystem has the greatest potential to support a diverse array of wildlife, creating a more balanced predator-prey relationship. 4. Stabilization and recovery: Eventually, the ecosystem will reach a stable state known as a climax community, where species composition and ecological processes are relatively constant over time. This community will persist until another disturbance event occurs, such as another forest fire, initiating the recovery process once again. Throughout this process, the affected ecosystem undergoes a natural restoration. Animal populations that were displaced during the fire will gradually return as the forest regenerates, provided that the habitat is not permanently altered due to human intervention or other factors. Bird populations may return to nest in the recovering forest and new generations will reoccupy the area. In conclusion, the final step in this process is the ecological response and recovery of the forest ecosystem, leading to a new stable state that supports a balanced and diverse community of animal and plant species. This process can take many years or even decades, depending on the severity of the disturbance and the resilience of the affected ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What would come of this venture as a whole?\\" in the context of the given information is the creation of universities that would foster scholarly expertise and contribute to the overall development of society. The passage explains how rulers and city governments across Europe recognized the importance of knowledge and its impact on society. They understood that universities would play a crucial role in nurturing and refining the intellectual capacity of their citizens. As a result, they established multiple universities to satisfy the growing thirst for knowledge in Europe. Two key factors played a significant role in this venture: 1. The emergence of humanism: Humanism became an essential driving force behind the founding of universities. Humanism, a cultural and intellectual movement during the Renaissance, focused on the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts and promoted the importance of human potential and achievement. This newfound interest in humanist principles inspired the creation of universities that would provide a platform for the study and dissemination of this knowledge. 2. The revival of interest in ancient Greek texts: The increased interest in ancient Greek texts during the Renaissance period led to the rediscovery of valuable knowledge that had been lost for centuries. This revival of interest played an essential role in inspiring rulers and city governments to establish universities that would facilitate the study of these texts and enable students to learn from the wisdom and expertise of the ancient world. In conclusion, the venture of creating universities across Europe as a whole led to the development of scholarly expertise, equipped individuals with the ability to address complex problems and achieve desired results, and contributed to the prosperity and well-being of societies. The emergence of humanism and the revival of interest in ancient Greek texts played crucial roles in this venture, making universities significant institutions in fostering intellectual growth and shaping the course of European history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their tough loss to the Giants, the Redskins traveled to Heinz Field to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and attempted to improve to 1-1 against the AFC. The Steelers marched straight down the field on Washington's defense, culminating in a fourth-and-goal 1-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end Leonard Pope from Ben Roethlisberger to give the Steelers a 7-0 lead. Following a Washington three-and-out, the Steelers got the ball back, this time scoring by way of former despised Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 48-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' advantage to 10-0. In the second, Washington was able to get on the board as quarterback Robert Griffin III found Santana Moss to cut into Pittsburgh's advantage 10-6. It would have been 10-7, but Kai Forbath's extra point was blocked. Pittsburgh responded with a Heath Miller 7-yard touchdown and a Suisham 27-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh a 20-6 lead at the half. In the third, Washington drew to 20-9 on a Forbath 48-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh nearly put the game away with a Will Johnson 1-yard touchdown catch to give Pittsburgh a 27-9 lead late in the third. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally as Forbath connected again, this time from 45 yards, but Washington could not score again, as a myriad of dropped passes and a turnover on downs with just over four minutes remaining sealed their fate, as the final score remained 27-12. With the loss, Washington fell to 3-5, and 0-2 against the AFC. Washington has now lost 6 straight games to AFC opponents and has not beaten an AFC team since Week 16 of the 2010 season.

As one of the world's most in-demand models, looking good is the key to Jourdan Dunn's career. With countless catwalk appearances and major campaigns under her belt, Jourdan is clearly doing something right...so what's her secret? FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress to find out - and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin. Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world so FEMAIL caught up with her about her skincare regime, diet and favourite fashion week moments. Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.' The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint. Jourdan, who has been sitting front row at fashion week and is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry. Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised. She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. Jourdan has been working for Maybelline New York since last April and gave the brand's new products a spin over London Fashion Week. (L to R) Pixie Geldof, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Sir Philip Green and Jourdan Dunn attend the Topshop Unique show during London Fashion Week. When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in. 'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved. There used to be nothing or just really boring food but they've really stepped it up. Diane Von Furstenberg even had an amazing gluten-free buffet backstage at her show.' To keep herself sane amid the backstage madness, Jourdan swears by meditating, which she says helps her 'zone out'. She cites her favourite thing about fashion week as seeing her friends (a roll call of the coolest young models in the industry including Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid). 'I don't get to see my friends very often and travelling around the world for shows can be really lonely and boring so I love it when me and my pals are all together for a catch-up,' she said. Jourdan, seen walking in Naomi Campbell's charity Fashion For Relief show, is currently the face of Burberry alongside her fellow supermodel. The six foot clothes horse, who has been dubbed the modern-day Naomi Campbell, has been working as the face of Maybelline New York since April last year. Jourdan joined an elite group of models who have worked for the brand, including Christy Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King. As a Vogue regular, who was scouted in Primark in her teens, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career. When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.

Hello little friends! Today, we are going to talk about the second longest field goal in American football history. A field goal is when a player kicks the football through the big \\"U\\" shaped posts called goalposts. This helps their team score points. Now, the second longest field goal ever was made by a man named Matt Prater. Matt made this amazing kick in a game in 2013. His team, the Denver Broncos, was playing against the Tennessee Titans. So, how many yards was it? Well, Matt kicked the ball through the goalposts from an incredible 64 yards away! That's like kicking the ball from one end of a very long swimming pool to the other! This amazing kick helped his team win, and everyone was really excited about it. To put it in perspective, imagine if you placed 64 one-yard-long toy cars one behind the other. That's how far Matt had to kick the ball to score the field goal! Wow! In case you're curious, the longest field goal ever was a tiny bit longer at 66 yards. It was made by a player named Justin Tucker in 2021. But, Matt Prater's field goal of 64 yards will always be remembered as an awesome accomplishment.

Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

Write a title for this article: The New Orleans Saints and the Detroit Lions, it should be noted, did play defense against each other. It just never seemed that way during the Saints’ 45-28 victory. Instead, watching this game was like watching tennis, head moving right, then left, back and forth, but slower, as both offenses took turns marching down the field. Despite a pair of fumbles, the Saints moved the ball at will, with the kind of panache and precision that reverberates across the league. Afterward, some Saints even suggested what once seemed improbable: that this offense is better than the one that carried New Orleans to a Super Bowl championship two years ago. When receiver Robert Meachem hauled in a 56-yard game-sealing score late in the fourth quarter, fittingly there was no defender within 20 yards of him. In the Saints’ triumph, in which they set an N.F.L. playoff record with 626 yards and both teams combined for an N.F.L. postseason-best 839 net passing yards, even the defenses were offensive. At the lectern afterward, Coach Sean Payton did not so much as crack a smile. He cut off an inevitable question about breaking another offensive record, his voice rushed. “We’re just focused on winning,” he said. “We’re not focused on yards or records.” New Orleans will play next week at San Francisco, a team that reinvented the passing offense in the 1980s but is known for its defense now. The Saints’ offense, which also gained 617 yards in its regular-season finale, is likely to be tested, outdoors and on the road and in the wind. Even if the events on Saturday did not provide that sort of implication. This game featured two teams that fancy passing. In the modern N.F.L., in which top-seeded New England and Green Bay boast the two most prolific offenses, Detroit and New Orleans have also bolstered the trend toward explosive offense, one completion at a time. Saints quarterback Drew Brees set league records for passing yards (5,476) and completion percentage (71.6) this season. Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford joined him in the 5,000-yard-plus club with 5,038. The teams’ meeting Saturday marked the first time two such club members met in the playoffs. This, too, caught the attention of the oddsmakers, who set the over-under at 59, the highest ever for the postseason in which the maxim “defense wins championships” never changes. The Saints, 13-3 yet seeded third, without a bye, entered the contest as a trendy pick to win the Super Bowl. They won their final eight games before the playoffs, went undefeated at home and topped the Lions, 31-17, about a month ago. So it figured the teams would combine for a million points and an infinite amount of yards — which is pretty much what happened, give or take a yard or two. The deluge of offense started early, as expected. Detroit needed only four minutes to score. Stafford passed for 70 yards on the drive, finding tight end Will Heller for a 10-yard touchdown that briefly silenced the sold-out crowd, which had roared so loudly that the Superdome shook. This marked the Lions’ first lead in a playoff game since 1994, an even longer drought than the one to their last postseason foray in 1999. The Saints moved the ball with similar ease, until receiver Marques Colston fumbled and linebacker Justin Durant recovered for Detroit. New Orleans resumed its season-long scoring spree on its next possession, though, covering 89 yards with the speed of an express train. When running back Darren Sproles shifted left, away from a wall of Lions defenders and into the end zone for a 2-yard score, he tied the game at 7-7. The game continued in this fashion, more proof, perhaps, of the shifting landscape in the N.F.L. This was not old-school football, not 3 yards and a cloud of dust. This was flag football played in shoulder pads, or video-game football brought to life. One interruption to the narrative — offense, offense, offense — came from the Saints, who fumbled twice in the first half, as Detroit took a 14-7 lead on a back shoulder Calvin Johnson (12 catches, 211 yards) touchdown catch. The halftime score — 14-10 after the Saints kicked a field goal — was misleading, if only because it was so low. By then, the teams had accumulated 353 passing yards and 466 yards over all. Collectively, Brees and Stafford amassed 31 completions. The Saints even gained 83 yards on the ground. Early into the third quarter, the Saints’ halftime adjustment seemed obvious: throw deep. On a pair of touchdown drives, Brees connected on two passes longer than 40 yards and had another throw of similar length dropped. The first went to Devery Henderson for a 41-yard gain that ended in the end zone. The second, a 40-yard strike to Colston, set up a touchdown toss to Jimmy Graham that extended the Saints’ lead to 24-14. That lasted for all of a few minutes. Stafford, feeling left out in the deep-ball department, lobbed a 42-yard pass into Johnson’s waiting hands. Stafford punctuated the drive with a scramble to the right front corner of the end zone, extending toward the pylon for a score officials upheld upon review. It was the Saints, though, who scored 35 points after halftime, who played offense the way the Beatles played music, masterfully. In case that point had not been driven home, Brees and Meachem connected on another late long ball, which gave Brees 466 passing yards. This helped to erase the memory that lingered from last season, when New Orleans traveled to Seattle and fell to the first team to make the playoffs with a losing record. On Saturday morning, cornerback Jabari Greer saw Matt Hasselbeck, last year a Seahawks cornerback, on television. The memories, which Greer helped erase with two interceptions, came flooding back. Soon enough, they were replaced with a flood of offense. The Saints never even punted.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang? is inside the article: ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress., can you guess it ?

The Bears opened the season hosting rival Green Bay Packers, the 191st meeting in the two teams' history and the third season opener in which both teams played each other in Chicago; the Bears held a 93-91-6 all-time lead, and also led the series in season opener record with 17-12-2. However, the Packers had won nine of the last ten games between the two, including the last game, a 55-14 victory at Lambeau Field. WBBM-TV analyst Jeff Joniak believed the Bears would have to run to gain an advantage against the Packers; when Chicago played Green Bay in week four last season, the latter had the 30th-ranked run defense, and allowed 235 rushing yards in that game. Additionally, the offense had to avoid drives that required long yardage, as the Bears had scored 74 points outside of the red zone (the 29th-best in the league), while also protecting quarterback Jay Cutler from linebackers Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews III. On defense, the new 3-4 defense faced a fast-paced Green Bay offense featuring quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tailback Eddie Lacy. The Rodgers-led Packers, who led the NFC North in touchdowns with 58, along with having the highest average yards per play (6.17) in the NFL in 2014, also provided a challenge for the Bears defensive backs; blitzing Rodgers was also a liability, as he had a league-best 130.4 rating with 15 touchdowns and one interception against the blitz. However, the Packers did not have receiver Jordy Nelson, who had caught 13 touchdowns in 2014, as he had suffered an ACL tear during the preseason. quarteback David Fales, cornerback Tracy Porter, runningback Ka'Deem Carey, linebacker Jon Bostic, center Hroniss Grasu, tackle Tayo Fabuluje and receiver Cameron Meredith were inactive for the game. The Packers won the coin toss, and elected to defer, meaning the Bears started the game with the ball. On the first possession of the game, the Bears offense reached as far as the Packers' eight-yard line, but ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 28-yard field goal. After the Packers punted, the Bears came close to allowing a turnover when Cutler was sacked by Peppers and fumbled, though the call was reversed. The next four drives of the game ended in scores for both teams: the Packers scored with Rodgers' 13-yard touchdown pass to James Jones, followed by the Bears reclaiming the lead in the second quarter with Matt Forte's one-yard touchdown run; the next two possessions concluded with field goals: Mason Crosby tied the game with a 37-yarder, though the Bears ended the first half with the 13-10 lead with Gould's 50-yarder. Prior to Forte's touchdown run, Gould had kicked a 27-yard field goal, but Sam Shields was offsides on the play, giving the Bears a 4th and 1, which the Bears capitalized with via Forte's one-yard run. The Bears then had two potential touchdowns nullified by Forte dropping a pass, and receiver Alshon Jeffery's touchdown was canceled by tackle Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty. The Packers also had a potential touchdown hurt by a penalty, as Rodgers had an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jones voided by holding penalties. In the second half, the Packers scored quickly with Jones' one-yard touchdown catch. The Bears responded with Gould's 44-yard field goal, but the Packers eventually scored again via Randall Cobb's five-yard touchdown catch. On Chicago's following drive, the offense drove to Green Bay's six-yard line to set up a first and goal situation. While Forte's four-yard run brought the Bears to the two, Cutler's passes to Eddie Royal, Jeffery and Royal again fell incomplete, leading to the Bears turning the ball over on downs. The Packers punted again, but the Bears failed to score when Cutler was intercepted by Matthews; the turnover set up Lacy's two-yard touchdown run to increase the score to 31-16 with 1:55 left in the game. With 34 seconds left, the Bears scored with Cutler's 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Martellus Bennett, narrowing the margin to eight points. However, Green Bay's Davante Adams recovered the onside kick, and the Packers ran out the clock to end the game. Gould's first field goal of the game allowed him to set the franchise record for the most field goals with 244, breaking a tie with Kevin Butler. Forte recorded 184 rushing yards in the game, the most by a Bears running back in a loss since Walter Payton's 175 yards in a 1984 loss to the Packers.

Write an article using the following points: Hong Kong's natural background radiation comes from local granite. Rock aggregate used in cement for local buildings. Radiation was monitored by Tokyo-based citizen action group. Levels of radiation in city are not harmful.","completion":"Title: Hong Kong's Natural Background Radiation: A Comprehensive Overview Introduction Hong Kong, a bustling metropolis on the southeastern coast of China, is well-known for its breathtaking skyline and vibrant city life. However, not many are aware of the natural background radiation that exists throughout the city, originating from the local granite formations found in Hong Kong. This article aims to discuss the natural radioactive background of Hong Kong, the use of granite aggregates in local building materials, the Tokyo-based citizen action group's role in monitoring this radiation, and why the radiation levels in Hong Kong are considered safe. Hong Kong's Natural Background Radiation The natural background radiation of Hong Kong primarily emanates from the local granite, which covers about 85% of the city's total land area. Granite is an igneous rock, composed of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica, and contains small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials such as uranium, thorium, and potassium-40. These elements emit gamma radiation, which contributes to the overall background radiation levels. Radiation in Building Materials In Hong Kong, the rock aggregate used for constructing buildings is sourced from local granite deposits. This means that the cement used in local buildings and infrastructure contains trace amounts of natural radioactive elements, contributing to the background radiation in the vicinity. However, it is essential to note that the radiation level in building materials is not high enough to pose any significant health risks. Monitoring Radiation Levels by Tokyo-based Citizen Action Group To ensure transparency and safety, a Tokyo-based citizen action group has been conducting regular radiation level tests and monitoring the situation in Hong Kong. This group, composed of experienced volunteers, works in collaboration with Hong Kong authorities to provide accurate and real-time data regarding radiation exposure in the city. By doing so, they aim to alleviate any undue concern while also promoting greater understanding about natural background radiation among the general public. Levels of Radiation in Hong Kong: Not Harmful According to the Hong Kong Observatory, the average dose of natural background radiation received by a resident in the city is approximately 2 millisieverts (mSv) per year. This value is considered to be relatively low when compared globally, with the worldwide average exposure to natural radiation being 2.4 mSv. Moreover, this value lies well below the internationally recommended exposure limit of 20 mSv, as set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. It is also important to emphasize that natural background radiation is present everywhere in our environment, and the controlled utilization of granite in building materials does not create any additional health risks. For comparison, cosmic radiation contributes around 0.4 mSv annually, while medical procedures such as X-rays add about 0.6 mSv annually to an individual's dose. Conclusion Hong Kong's natural background radiation, primarily emanating from local granite formations, plays a role in the overall radiation levels observed in the city. The use of granite aggregate in construction materials does contribute to background radiation, but the levels remain well within the safe limits established by international guidelines. Thanks to monitoring by the Tokyo-based citizen action group, residents can have confidence in the safety and transparency of radiation level measurements in Hong Kong. By understanding the nature of the city's background radiation, citizens can appreciate the inherently low risk that it poses, while continuing to enjoy the dynamic and vibrant atmosphere Hong Kong has to offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: is mahi-mahi a type of dolphin?","completion":"No, the mahi-mahi is not a type of dolphin. Although the name \\"common dolphinfish\\" may sound misleading, the mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) is a species of fish and is not related to dolphins, which are marine mammals. The mahi-mahi is a surface-dwelling ray-finned fish found in off-shore temperate, tropical, and subtropical waters worldwide. The name \\"dolphinfish\\" is due to its physical appearance, which is marked by a blunt head, striking colors, and a somewhat streamlined body, resembling some characteristics of a dolphin. However, scientifically and biologically, the mahi-mahi and dolphins belong to completely different groups and share no close evolutionary relation. The mahi-mahi belongs to the family Coryphaenidae, with another member being the pompano dolphinfish. These fish are also commonly known as dorado. They are characterized by their unique shape, vibrant coloration, and swift swimming capabilities. Mahi-mahi are primarily known for their brilliant colors, which include golden, green, and blue hues, giving them a distinctive appearance. The fish can undergo swift color changes when under stress or pursuing prey, displaying a wide range of color variations. On the other hand, dolphins are marine mammals that belong to the family Delphinidae, within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphins are highly intelligent creatures, known for their playful behavior, advanced communication skills, and echolocation capabilities. They have distinct features such as a streamlined body, a dorsal fin, and a pointed snout filled with sharp teeth. Dolphins are also air-breathing mammals, unlike the mahi-mahi, which extract oxygen through gills, like other fish. The confusion between the terms \\"dolphin\\" and \\"dolphinfish\\" can lead someone to assume that the mahi-mahi is a type of dolphin, but they are not related in any way other than their somewhat similar appearance. In fact, the mahi-mahi and the actual dolphin are part of two completely separate and distinct groups in the animal kingdom, with the former being a fish and the latter being a marine mammal. In order to differentiate between the two, the term \\"mahi-mahi\\" is typically used to refer specifically to the fish species Coryphaena hippurus, and to avoid confusion with the marine mammals known as dolphins."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His father tried to save the lives of his people by fighting a giant polar bear. Keesh's father was crushed to death during the struggle. But he killed the bear, and the meat from the bear kept the people from starving. Keesh was his only son, and he lived alone with his mother. But people are forgetful, and they soon forgot how Keesh's father had saved their lives. And since Keesh was only a boy and his mother was a woman and not a warrior , they were forced to live in the smallest and poorest igloo in the village. One night there was a council meeting in the large igloo of Klosh-Kwan, who was the chief. At that meeting Keesh showed how much courage he possessed. He rose to his feet and waited for silence. Then, with the dignity of an older man, he said, \\" It is true that my mother and I are given meat to eat. But the meat is always old and tough, filled with bones, and difficult to eat.\\" The hunters--both the young and the old--were shocked to hear a child speak to them that way. But Keesh went on steadily, \\"Because my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I can speak these words. You know that Bok brought home more meat than any hunter in the village.

He could hear angry murmuring all around him. Some men began to shout at Keesh. They ordered him to leave. They threatened to punish him by not giving him any food at all. Keesh's eyes flashed and the blood pounded under his skin.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it.

And you won't have to wander far from home to enjoy one of these national treasures, with Michigan's Isle Royale National Park nearby. Located 56 miles from Copper Harbor on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the park remains _ that can only be reached by tour boat. With the exception of the Rock Harbor Lodge, which offers both rooms with private baths and accommodations in the form of small cottages, the 572,000 acres that make up the 45-mile-long park are rough, threaded with hiking paths that lead to tents-only campsites. You are likely to see a deer crossing mist-covered ponds in search of breakfast, gaze bald eagles flying overhead, or hear a beaver clapping its tail on the water. If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge.

Information: - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Martin Luther (10 November 1483 18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707 29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns. - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian. - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius. - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. - Joseph ( Hebrew , Yosef ; Greek : , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed . - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. What is the relationship between 'saint joseph' and 'jesus christ'? A:","completion":"Saint Joseph is considered the foster father or legal guardian of Jesus Christ in Christianity. He was married to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is the mother of Jesus. According to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Joseph was a righteous man who raised Jesus and provided for his family. Although not much is written about Joseph's direct interactions with Jesus, it is believed that he played an important role in the upbringing of Jesus in adherence to Jewish customs and traditions. Although there are different genealogies provided in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, tracing Jesus' lineage back to King David through Joseph's family line, it is important to note that Christians believe in the Virgin birth of Jesus. This means that Joseph is not considered the biological father of Jesus; rather, he holds a significant place as the earthly guardian and caretaker of Jesus. In addition to being regarded as a saint in various Christian denominations, Saint Joseph is also the patron saint of workers, families, and the Universal Church. Overall, Saint Joseph's relationship with Jesus Christ is that of a foster father or legal guardian who raised Jesus and taught him the ways of a faithful Jewish life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Comment: “Most high school kids across America today couldn’t identify a clitoris.” That's the prime reason Google was invented.","completion":"To categorize the comment, we need to look at its content and analyze it in the context of the provided classes, which are sexual-explicit and non-sexual-explicit. 1. First, we break down the comment: \\"Most high school kids across America today couldn’t identify a clitoris. That's the prime reason Google was invented.\\" This comment mentions a sexual body part (clitoris), but it's in the context of anatomical knowledge and education. It is not explicitly sexual or describing a sexual act, but instead addresses the lack of sex education in schools and the existing gap in knowledge. 2. Secondly, the comment seems to subtly mock or criticize the situation that people rely on online platforms like Google to seek basic knowledge. It does not include any explicit sexual content or describe any sexual activity. Therefore, based on the analysis above, I would categorize this comment as non-sexual-explicit. While it does mention a sex-related term in a scientific or educational context, it does not openly portray sexual actions or present any sexually explicit material or intention. The purpose of the comment seems less about sexual content and more about a statement on education and the use of the internet for information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Definition: Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type. Otherwise classify it as \\"no\\". \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Try reading college-level textbooks, which are written in the same style that the TOEFL will use, and cover a wide range of topics. You should definitely build reading time into your study schedule, but try to add additional reading time to your day, too. Try reading during your commute or before you go to bed. Use the internet! News articles, blogs, and online magazines are all helpful when improving your reading skills. You can read whatever interests you. Try food blogs if you are trying to improve your cooking skills, or read about health and wellness if you're trying to get fit. All that matters is that you read. After you read an article or text, write a brief summary. Make sure to include all of the main points of the text. If there are 2 viewpoints being expressed, make sure to include both of those in your summary. Start by listing the main points and the supporting details. Then turn those into a complete paragraph. After you write your summary, go back and fix any spelling or grammatical errors. It’s really important that you understand what you are reading. Test yourself by answering some basic questions after you read a text. For example, make sure that you can answer basic questions. It's always a good idea to be able to identify the \\"who, what, when, where, and why.\\" Have a friend quiz you by coming up with questions about what you’ve just read. Improving your vocabulary will help you read better. Keep a small notebook with you at all times so you can write down new words. Any time you hear or read a new word, write it down. When you have time, look up the meaning and write that down, too. You can make flashcards with your vocab words on them so that you can easily quiz yourself. Make sure that your essay has an introduction, body, and conclusion. While you are writing practice essays, get in the habit of structuring your essays in that way. Each body paragraph should focus on 1 subject. Don’t forget to include a strong thesis statement! Use keywords and phrases to mark your place in the essay. For example, if you’re comparing to points, say, “In contrast to…” When you come to your last paragraph, you can say something like, “To conclude…” When you’re studying, stick to a plan for writing your essays. You should get used to spending 4-5 minutes planning and organizing your writing. Save another 5 minutes at the end to edit your work. The rest of the time should be devoted to writing the essay. You should use clear, brief sentences for the writing portion. Make sure to stay on topic and only write about the main points of your outline. For example, if you're writing about an essay on taking care of your dog, you might write, \\"The most important thing is to give your dog lots of attention. Play with it, take it outside, and talk to it every day. You also need to focus on giving it nutritious food.\\" Write in the active voice to make your points really clear.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Question: \\"Why couldn't the FAA and the Defense Department officials coordinate a military response during the conference call set up at FAA headquarters at 9:20?\\" Response: \\"No one had the right officials on the calls before 10am\\" Available choices: [-] no [-] yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"yes The response correctly answers the question because it states that none of the teleconferences before 10:00 included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department.

Depressed teen Ashton Sachs guns down both his parents then gives moving eulogy at their funeral A DEPRESSED teen shot his parents as they slept at their £2m mansion – then told mourners they would continue to ‘guide him’ through life. Ashton Sachs, 19, fought back tears as he spoke at his parents’ funeral describing them as the perfect mum and dad. “I really do believe that they will continue to guide me throughout life,” Ashton said to the devastated congregation. But what everybody else didn’t know was that the teen was responsible for a horror crime which left cops baffled. Weeks earlier, ‘an intruder’ had entered the family mansion and gunned down Brad and Andra Sachs with an automatic rifle. Their youngest son was left paralysed and their two daughters, who escaped unharmed, were deeply traumatised. Ashton’s touching funeral words had moved a community so when later police named him as the killer locals were stunned. Andra, 54, and Brad, 57, lived in the affluent community of San Juan Capistrano, California. Back in 1999, the couple had been through a bitter divorce after their 16-month-old daughter Sabrina accidentally drowned in the family pool. But the couple reunite and the family were said to be happier than ever. They had two daughters, Lana, 15, and Alexis, 17, and three boys, Landon, eight, Ashton, 19, and Myles, 21. Lana and Landon had been adopted from Russia. Ashton and Myles had left home for college and lived 1,200 miles away in Washington. On the night of the killing, Ashton entered the Sachs’ family house through an unlocked door and went up to his parent’s bedroom. He opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle and shot them multiple times at close range. Andra took 10 bullets. Brad, a dozen. He then went into Landon’s room and fired at the bed. Landon was left bleeding and crying hysterically that he couldn’t feel his legs. The intruder then fired at Alexis, but as she hid under the covers, the bullet missed her. Her sister Lana wasn’t shot at. As part of his charade, Ashton kept a vigil by Landon’s bedside. A bullet had pierced his spinal cord and he was paralysed from the chest down. Ashton even helped compile a list of potential enemies. Then investigators discovered a car parked at premises owned by the Sachs family. In the boot was the rifle used in the shooting. The white car belonged to Ashton. Ashton was then arrested and charged with premeditated murder. When questioned, Ashton said his plan was to “shoot them and then kill myself”. “I was like, not myself… I was something twisted,” he said. Investigators discovered Ashton had bought the gun weeks before and he’d driven 18 hours non-stop to get to the family home, never wavering from his plan. He suggested he was angry with his parents because they didn’t trust him and he thought that he was their least favourite child. This year, Ashton made a shock guilty plea and was sentenced Ashton to four life sentences, plus another 100 years. Myles, 23, is now guardian to his orphaned siblings, including wheelchair-bound Landon, who is courageously adjusting to his life-changing injuries.

It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity.

A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864 January 27, 1922), known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist. She was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within.

The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it became a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. - Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term \\"yellow journalism\\" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion. - Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated.

American newspapers began as modest affairsa sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press and the American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism and technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s helped expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th Century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles. - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847 October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\".

INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news.

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house.

Pressing on, the team reaches the insurgent camp and kills every single guerilla, including a Soviet intelligence officer searching through top-secret CIA documents. Dillon, confronted by a suspicious Dutch, admits the mission was a setup to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score? from the following article ? In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.

Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble.

Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. Hint: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line.

Whether it's putting together a mixed tape for a road trip, creating a workout playlist, or compiling your favorite tracks for a chilled-out evening at home, finding the right songs can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Thankfully, iTunes has got you covered with smart and genius playlists. These special features do all the heavy lifting for you, leaving you to simply enjoy your music. In this article, we'll show you how to use smart playlists to set your parameters and let iTunes do the rest and explore the magic of genius playlists to find similar songs automatically. Section 1 - What are Smart Playlists? Smart playlists are an amazing feature that allows iTunes to create customized playlists for you based on a wide range of parameters. Rather than manually adding each song to your playlist, smart playlists generate a dynamic collection of tunes that match your specified criteria. This means you can create a playlist that changes over time, keeping your listening experience fresh and exciting. Section 2 - Setting Up Smart Playlists To begin creating a smart playlist, follow these steps: 1. Open iTunes and navigate to the \\"File\\" menu. 2. Select \\"New\\" and then \\"Smart Playlist\\". 3. Before proceeding, ensure that the \\"Match The Following Rule\\" box is checked. This option enables you to set criteria for your playlist, and iTunes will only include songs that meet these conditions. 4. Now, you can set the parameters for your playlist. Click the \\"+\\" button to add new rules. You can select from a wide range of options, including song title, artist, album, genre, year of release, rating, play count, and more. 5. After defining your rules, you can choose to limit your playlist by a specific number of items or the total duration of the playlist. This is particularly useful if you want to limit your playlist for a workout or a specific duration of time. 6. Finally, check the \\"live updating\\" option before clicking \\"OK\\". This allows your playlist to stay automatically up to date as you add more songs to your library that meet your defined criteria. Section 3 - What are Genius Playlists? While smart playlists offer a tailored music experience, genius playlists take it a step further by analyzing your musical tastes and recommending songs that complement your preferences. Genius playlists are an intelligent iTunes feature that identifies similar tracks in your library based on various factors such as genre, artist, and song characteristics. Section 4 - Generating Genius Playlists Creating a genius playlist is a breeze with these simple steps: 1. To begin, select a song that you'd like iTunes to base your genius playlist upon. This song will act as the inspiration for the associated tunes in your playlist. 2. Right-click on the chosen song and select \\"Create Genius Playlist\\". 3. iTunes will automatically analyze your song and generate a playlist of 25 similar tracks from your music library. You can increase the number of tracks in the playlist by clicking the refresh button located at the bottom right corner of the playlist window. Conclusion iTunes' smart and genius playlists are powerful tools that simplify the process of creating tailored playlists, allowing you to focus on enjoying your music. Harness the power of these features by setting up parameters and letting iTunes do the work for you when using smart playlists or entrusting the software to find similar songs using genius playlists.

Problem: Solve -27*g - 18*g = -28*g + 61*g + 1092 for g. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -27g - 18g = -28g + 61g + 1092 for g, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Isolate g on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for g. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. -27g - 18g = -28g + 61g -45g = 33g + 1092 Step 2: Isolate g on one side of the equation. To isolate g, we'll add 45g to both sides of the equation. -45g + 45g = 33g + 45g + 1092 0 = 78g + 1092 Step 3: Solve for g. To solve for g, we'll subtract 1092 from both sides of the equation, then divide by 78. (0 - 1092) = 78g + 1092 - 1092 -1092 = 78g Now, we'll divide both sides by 78. -1092 / 78 = 78g / 78 -14 = g So, the solution to the equation is g = -14."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. breathe B. sky C. build a nest D. pick berries E. reproduce The best answer is A:","completion":"In August, the birds were primarily looking to engage in activities related to their natural seasonal behaviors, and the best answer to this question would be D. pick berries. During this time of the year, migratory birds prepare for their journey southward, while other birds start the process of gathering food for the upcoming months. At this point in the season, many delicious, nutrient-rich berries have ripened and are becoming available. Birds are aware of the changing environment and abundance of food during August, and they are instinctively driven to gather and consume these berries. Berries provide a critical source of energy and nutrients for birds as they prepare themselves for the cooler months ahead or for their migration to warmer climates. Picking berries helps them maintain their physical health and store the energy necessary for the challenges ahead. Some bird species, like the American Robin, Cedar Waxwing, and Eastern Bluebird, are especially attracted to berries as an essential part of their diet. As for the other answer choices: A. While it is true that birds need to breathe to stay alive, this option is not the primary reason they are looking around in August, as breathing is a constant biological requirement, regardless of the month. B. Sky does not represent a specific activity or goal for the birds in August, making it an invalid choice. C. Building a nest is not the primary focus for birds in August, as most birds have already constructed their nests in the previous months (usually in spring) for raising their offspring. However, some birds may still carry out nesting activities if their first nesting attempt has failed, or if they are a multi-brood species. E. Reproduction is generally not the primary goal for birds during August. Bird breeding season typically occurs in spring, when food resources such as insects are more abundant for feeding their offspring. While not impossible, it is less likely for birds to reproduce during August compared to earlier months. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"D. pick berries\\" because birds are mostly engaged in gathering valuable food resources in August, such as berries to prepare for the upcoming challenges of migration or the cooler months."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the statement provided is a reasonable answer to the question, \\"What is non-binding?\\" A non-binding arbitration means that the decision made by the arbitrator during the arbitration process is not legally enforceable, and the parties involved are not obligated to follow the arbitrator's recommendations or ruling. In this case, the arbitration serves as a form of guidance for the parties in helping them reach a resolution to their dispute. The statement accurately reflects that after a non-binding arbitration, the parties have the option to pursue their claims further through a court trial or a binding arbitration, where the decision would be enforceable.

Q:Question: How does the dark haired woman choose the name Rita? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mulholland Drive Context: The story may not be linear and exhibits several instances of temporal disruption. A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead. Trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \\"Diane Selwyn\\".

A:","completion":"In the movie Mulholland Drive, the dark-haired woman chooses the name Rita when she, along with Betty Elms, come across a poster for the film Gilda (1946) starring Rita Hayworth. The dark-haired woman, who is suffering from amnesia after her attempted murder and a car accident on Mulholland Drive, assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing the poster as she does not remember her own name. Throughout the rest of the movie, Betty takes it upon herself to help Rita uncover her true identity, leading them on a mysterious and nonlinear journey through Los Angeles. As the storyline unfolds, viewers are exposed to themes of corruption, deception, and illusion in the Hollywood industry while the characters battle their inner demons and strive to find the truth about themselves. The naming of the character Rita is a reference to an iconic Hollywood actress, Rita Hayworth, which ties into the storyline's exploration of the glamorous and dark sides of Hollywood. The choice of the name \\"Rita\\" is symbolic of the blending of realities and illusions, while also serving as a simple way for the character to choose a name while struggling with her amnesia and lost identity. The journey that Rita and Betty embark on together blends different narratives and timeframes, which further highlights the movie's disjointed, dreamlike nature and mysterious plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Super market delivery man The answer is:","completion":"Title: A Supermarket Hero Plot Summary: The film revolves around Doob, an unassuming yet dedicated supermarket delivery man in a small American town. His life is thrown into chaos when he discovers a potentially world-threatening conspiracy in his seemingly innocuous deliveries. He inadvertently gets entangled in a web of mystery, danger, and adventure, all while doing the one job he loves most: delivering groceries. Plot Outline: Act 1: 1. Introduction: Doob is introduced as an ordinary, kind, and somewhat introverted individual in his late 20s. He has a stable, if low-paying job as a supermarket delivery man. He enjoys the simple life, and shares a close bond with his customers. 2. Fleeting Dreams: Despite his contentment, Doob occasionally dreams about a more exciting life, but brushes it aside, assuming such adventures only happen to other people. 3. The Unusual Delivery: One day, Doob picks up a delivery order for a new entity in town, a research lab operating on the outskirts. He delivers the package without any fuss, but something about the interaction piqued his curiosity. Act 2: 4. Doob's Discovery: Over the next few deliveries, Doob starts noticing strange patterns in the packages he delivers to the lab. He soon uncovers that the packages contain the components for building a powerful and dangerous device, which could potentially wreak havoc on a global scale. 5. Reluctant Heroism: Doob grapples with his conscience about whether or not to delve deeper into the mystery of the device and expose the conspiracy. He shares his findings with his best friend, Shelby, who convinces him that he must act to save the world. 6. Gathering Allies: Together, Doob and Shelby assemble a group of quirky and resourceful friends who, despite their shared inexperience, pledge to do whatever they can to stop the dangerous device from being built. They turn to Frank, a disgruntled lab employee disillusioned with the project, who then offers to work as their inside man. Act 3: 7. Mission Impossible: Doob and his team hatch a plan to break into the lab and sabotage the device. Using their inside intelligence, they go through a series of tense and action-packed scenarios, narrowly avoiding capture at every turn. 8. Climactic Battle: Just as they think they have succeeded, they confront the mastermind behind the plot, Dr. Wraith, who, having anticipated their infiltration, is ready for a confrontation. He reveals his true intentions: he believes that human overconsumption is leading the planet to ruin, and the device he plans to activate will force the world to reduce its demand for resources, instigating a new era of sustainability and conservation. 9. Resolution and Sacrifice: Doob tries to reason with Dr. Wraith, offering to find non-violent alternatives to protect the environment, but the mad doctor is unyielding. In a desperate attempt to save the world, Doob and his team disable the device and defeat Dr. Wraith and his goons. Frank sacrifices himself to ensure the mission's success, further uniting the team and giving them closure. Epilogue: 10. New Beginnings: The events bring renewed life to the town and Doob's once mundane job now holds newfound importance and prestige as he resumes his role as the supermarket delivery man - but with a heightened sense of adventure and newfound respect from the community. The close friendships formed throughout this journey have further enriched Doob's life, all while remaining true to his life's purpose: being a part of the daily life of his beloved town. \\"A Supermarket Hero\\" is an action-comedy film that emphasizes the importance of environmental awareness, the heroism in everyday people, and the power of friendship.

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.

In this case, both the sentences, \\"Agathe knows Guillaume had a lover, but believes it was a young woman, Guillaume and Tom's co-worker Sarah.\\" and \\"Agathe knows that Guillaume had a lover, but believes that it was a young woman, Guillaume and Tom's co-worker Sarah.\\" are expressing the same idea.

The structure of the sentences and the way the ideas are formulated might vary slightly but they carry the same intrinsic meaning. The sentence structure in the first version is more direct and compact by juxtaposing the main clause with two micro clauses afterward. The second version uses more connecting words, specifically the word \\"that\\", which is used to enhance clarity and readability. While they are not identical in structure, they are functionally equivalent, thus they can be referred to as paraphrases.

Write some highlights for the following article: There was widespread outrage among UEFA delegates at their meeting ahead of the FIFA Congress when the £16million outlay on Sepp Blatter’s vanity project film was discussed. The European representatives were aghast that Blatter should commit so much money — more than the annual turnover of most of UEFA’s national associations — to the FIFA history film United Passions, which was launched at the Cannes Film Festival last month. When Sports Agenda first revealed the sum Blatter had agreed to put into the project — against staff advice — Zurich claimed the true figure was far lower. Under fire: FIFA president Sepp blatter has been criticised by UEFA delegates. But financial director Markus Kattner, who rubber stamped the decision without the knowledge of a number of FIFA executive committee members, confirmed it was £16m this week. Kattner added that it was agreed at the 2009 Congress and included in FIFA’s 2010 financial report as a World Cup budget entry. But it is understandable that representatives from FIFA’s main decision-making committee knew nothing about this increasingly murky affair when their independent audit overseer Domenico Scala acknowledged it was a ‘single line entry’ without a purpose being specified. Spilling the beans: FIFA's finance administrator has confirmed the £16m sum used to make the film. FIFA will have to spend upwards of £1million on sending blood and urine samples from World Cup drugs tests to Switzerland after Rio’s poorly-equipped laboratory had its accreditation removed. World Anti-Doping Agency president Sir Craig Reedie will hold talks in Rio on Saturday to make sure preparations for a new lab for the 2016 Olympics are on course. Brazil Games chief Carlos Nuzman has invited Reedie to dinner, making sure it did not clash with the England game. Craig pointed out it would not be a problem as he is Scottish. Sepp Blatter has easily seen off all challengers to his FIFA presidency but UEFA chief Michel Platini is playing a canny game. Platini, whose FIFA election contention has shifted from definitely not to maybe, is wisely keeping options open to see how far Blatter’s reputation is tarnished from the Qatar scandal and the fall-out from Brazil’s shambolic World Cup preparation. Keeping his options open: Michel Platini with Blatter on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the criticism by David Gill, who rarely speaks in public, of Blatter’s ridiculous claims of racism against the British press is seen as a clear sign of him emerging as a candidate to be the next UEFA president. Both the BBC and ITV will have backdrops of Copacabana Beach and Sugarloaf Mountain from their purpose-built Rio broadcasting positions. The BBC facilities are bigger and no wonder, as they have sent 272 personnel to Brazil compared to ITV’s 123. Meanwhile, Sky Sports administrator Brendan Henry is considering bringing home two of Sky Sports News’s four crews in Brazil after FIFA barred non rights holders from pre-match access to World Cup stadiums. Delayed: England's journey from their hotel to the training base is becoming a nightmare. England’s journey from their hotel to their training base must be causing concern. First predicted to take 20 minutes, the eight-mile trip initially took 39 minutes, then 45 and on Wednesday lasted 55 minutes, with the extra delays blamed on protests on the Copacabana. There have been no signs of the priority lanes promised to the FA, while there is no chance of a rebellious Rio public observing the Olympic lanes that must be installed for the 2016 Games. A 2016 spokesman said lane details were under discussion. Things are no better in Sao Paulo, where FIFA executive committee members endured four-hour journeys from the airport and saw delegates bussed in at 7am yesterday to avoid the traffic chaos. Perhaps they may now be looking forward to the World Cup in Qatar, where all stadiums are in a 75-mile radius. Charm offensive: James Milner and team-mate Phil Jagielka have met fans. It may all go pear-shaped in Manaus on Friday, but the FA charm offensive has continued through the week in Miami and up to the eve of the team travelling to the Amazon city, with England players Phil Jagielka and James Milner staging a meet and greet with fans at a hotel near the team’s Royal Tulip base.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Question: Given the following context: Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the... answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade, according to McVeagh?

Please answer the following question: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences.

The reason for this difficulty was that it became challenging to determine the relative amount of heterosexual and homosexual experiences and responses in a person's history when using the Kinsey scale. According to the researchers, when an individual has a significant number of both types of experiences, it becomes difficult for them to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each experience, thus making it harder to assign an accurate Kinsey rating. This highlights one of the limitations of the Kinsey scale and suggests that a more nuanced and granular approach may be necessary for understanding and categorizing the complexities of human sexuality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Twins of Evil Context: Maria and Frieda, recently orphaned identical twin teenage girls, move from Venice to Karnstein in Central Europe to live with their uncle Gustav Weil. Weil is a stern puritan and leader of the fanatical witch-hunting 'Brotherhood'. Both twins resent their uncle's sternness and one of them, Frieda, looks for a way to escape. Resenting her uncle, she becomes fascinated by the local Count Karnstein, who has the reputation of being \\"a wicked man\\". Count Karnstein, who enjoys the Emperor's favour and thus remains untouched by the Brotherhood, is indeed wicked and interested in Satanism and Black Magic. Trying to emulate his evil ancestors, he murders a girl as a Human Sacrifice, calling forth Countess Mircalla Karnstein from her grave. Mircalla turns the Count into a vampire. Frieda, following an invitation from the Count, steals away to the castle at night, while Maria covers for her absence. In the castle, the Count transforms Frieda into a vampire, offering her a beautiful young chained victim. Returning home, Frieda threatens Maria to keep covering for her nightly excursions, but secretly fearing she might bite her sister. Meanwhile, Maria becomes interested in the handsome young teacher, Anton, who is initially infatuated with the more mysterious Frieda. Anton has studied what he calls \\"superstition\\", but becomes convinced of the existence of vampires when his sister falls victim to one. One night, when Frieda attacks a member of the Brotherhood, she is captured by her uncle and put in jail. While the Brotherhood debates the vampire woman's fate, the Count and his servants kidnap Maria and exchange her for Frieda in the cell. Anton goes to see Maria, not knowing that she is actually Frieda. She tries to seduce him, but he sees her lack of reflection in a mirror and repels her with a cross. Anton rushes to rescue Maria from burning. Maria kisses a cross, revealing her innocence. Weil now listens to Anton's advice on the proper ways to fight vampires, and the two men lead the Brotherhood and villagers to... Answer:","completion":"Maria's innocence is revealed when Anton rushes to rescue her from the impending danger of being burned. As the villagers are under the impression that Maria has become a vampire, they are determined to burn her. However, her true nature starts to unveil as she kisses a cross in desperation, thereby proving her innocence. A vampire would have been unable to kiss the cross without revealing their wicked nature. The cross serves as a symbol of purity and holiness, which a vampire cannot touch without harming oneself. Upon witnessing her action, the villagers realize that they had mistaken Maria for her twin sister, Frieda, who had been turned into a vampire by Count Karnstein. The error is understandable since the sisters are identical twins, and it is not uncommon for one sibling to bear the consequences of the other's actions, especially when appearances are entirely indistinguishable. The revelation of Maria's innocence not only saves her from a terrible fate but also enables her genuine, good-hearted nature to shine through. This newfound understanding enables Weil, Anton, and the rest of the Brotherhood to focus their efforts on combating the true evil in their midst: the vampires, specifically Count Karnstein and Frieda. Guided by Anton's advice on how to properly fight and defeat vampires, they gather their forces with renewed determination to protect their village and put an end to the vampires' reign of terror."},{"prompt":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which magazine got published first, Nova or Mademoiselle?

Greeted by throngs of Catholic worshipers from across the region, Pope Benedict XVI ended his two-country tour in Havana's Revolution Plaza with a reference to what he described as a need for \\"authentic freedom.\\" Changes between Cuba and the world can come only if \\"each one is prepared to ask for the truth and if they decide to take the path of love, sowing reconciliation and brotherhood,\\" the pope said Wednesday. He also met with the Communist country's former leader, Fidel Castro, before heading to the airport for a Rome-bound flight Wednesday evening. Conflicting reports emerged Wednesday over whether the pope had met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Two Cuban sources told CNN the pontiff met Tuesday with Chavez, who is in Cuba for cancer treatment. But Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said reports of the meeting were false. In a farewell speech just before boarding the plane, he criticized the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, saying \\"restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people.\\" Benedict, whose office has routinely cast the trip in the context of a spiritual pilgrimage, at times addressed political issues -- often subtly, and on occasion more overtly. At the start of his visit, aboard a flight from Rome, he denounced violence caused by the drug war in Mexico and blasted Cuba's Marxist political system by saying it \\"no longer corresponds to reality.\\" Later, he prayed for \\"those deprived of freedom\\" while in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba. And he made several references to freedom in his final sermon in Havana, addressing a nation that human rights groups have routinely denounced for its abuses. Many in Cuba and around the world listened closely to the pope's homily at the enormous open-air Mass Wednesday to see whether he would expand on -- or be more forceful in -- his apparent criticisms. But his comments often seemed couched in a broader discussion of religious openness. \\"It is with joy that in Cuba there have been steps so that the church can carry out its mission,\\" but the country must continue to strengthen this path, he said. Tens of thousands of faithful packed Revolution Plaza to hear Wednesday's Mass. The pope arrived in the so-called popemobile, his bulletproof vehicle, which slowly made its way to the altar. At some points, he appeared just a few feet from the crowd, which shifted as onlookers tried to get a closer look. Rescue workers carried away at least three people who fainted in what was a comparably mild Caribbean heat, after waiting for hours for the pope to arrive. \\"Every time the pontiff comes comes here, there's always some sort of transformative period for us afterward,\\" said Jorge Luis Rodriguez, a Havana resident who joined the thousands that filled the square on Wednesday. But Cuban dissidents complained that police prohibited some activists from leaving their homes to attend the Mass and that others were detained. Amnesty International said in a statement that activists were \\"facing a surge in harassment in a bid to silence them during the pope's visit.\\" Government opponents were detained, threatened or stopped from traveling freely leading up to pontiff's arrival, according to the human rights group. \\"The clampdown has seen an increase in arrests, activists' phones have been disconnected, and some have had their houses surrounded to prevent them (from) denouncing abuses during Pope Benedict's tour,\\" the group said. CNN could not independently confirm those reports. The pope's visit comes 14 years after Pope John Paul II addressed massive crowds near the towering sculpture of Che Guevara in the historic first papal visit to the island nation. Elsida Martinez, a Havana resident who said she watched from the square when John Paul spoke in 1998, said there was a noticeable difference between the two pontiffs. Cuba itself was also different, she said. \\"When we saw John Paul, Cubans didn't really know anything about religion,\\" Martinez said. \\"Now we're open more. We practice (religion) more. We believe more.\\" When John Paul came \\"it was a different period in our history,\\" said Camilo Ortiz, a 50-year-old Havana resident, but the former pontiff's visit still \\"had more power\\" than Benedict's. \\"During that time, there were many difficulties here,\\" Ortiz added. \\"Now, there are some changes, and things are a little better.\\" After the island's so-called \\"special period,\\" which began in the early 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba -- which had long enjoyed Soviet subsidies -- was confronted with a prolonged period of economic hardship. When John Paul visited years later, the country was still reeling from its effects. Cuba is Benedict's second stop on a tour that has also taken him to Mexico, where he denounced the violence-plagued drug war before traveling to the island nation. \\"In Cuba, there will not be political reform,\\" said Marino Murillo, vice president of the island's council of ministers, responding to the pope's remarks about its Marxist political system. But some Havana residents at Wednesday's Mass said they were optimistic. \\"For me, there's a hope\\" that comes with Benedict's visit, Ortiz said. \\"There's a hope that something's going to change.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Pope Benedict XVI concluded his two-country tour in Havana's Revolution Plaza, where he was greeted by a large number of Catholic worshipers. In his speech, he emphasized the need for \\"authentic freedom\\" and stated that changes between Cuba and the world can only come about through love, reconciliation, and brotherhood. He also met with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and criticized the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, claiming it unfairly burdens Cuba's people. The Pope discussed political issues subtly during his visit, denouncing violence caused by the drug war in Mexico and criticizing Cuba's Marxist political system, stating it \\"no longer corresponds to reality.\\" He also prayed for \\"those deprived of freedom\\" in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba, and made several references to freedom in his final sermon in Havana. The Pope's visit comes 14 years after Pope John Paul II spoke to large crowds in Cuba, marking the first papal visit to the island nation. Many Cubans now feel that they are more open to practicing religion and express hope that Pope Benedict XVI's visit will bring about positive changes in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Given the following context: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Here is a news article: A ]wave of fetish-related Google searches followed the most recent episode of 11.22.63, after a scene introduced a form of masochism involving genitals and a clothespin. It was weird. But how weird was it, really? The holy bible of judgmental psychiatric boards everywhere — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) — defines “paraphilic” sexual interests as unusual or anomalous. But the basis for those judgments isn’t exactly clear. In an article published this week in The Journal of Sex Research, researchers asked: Is something actually unusual if a lot of people do it? To find out, the team from University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres and Philippe Pinel Institute of Montreal took to computer screens and phone lines of Quebec, surveying a sample of 1,040 people. Classified according to factors like age, gender, religious affiliation and education, the group was thought to represent the province’s norms. Voyeurism, classified by the DSM as a paraphilic behavior, is surprisingly common. The researchers probed participants’ interests in the eight paraphilic behaviors listed in the DSM: voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism (touching or rubbing against a non-consenting individual), masochism, sadism, pedophilia, fetishism (technically, using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on non-genital body parts), and transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing to the point of distress or harm). Because the authors focused only on the behaviors themselves — not the way in which people engaged in them — it’s especially important to note the difference between a paraphilic behavior and disorder. Paraphilias aren’t considered mental disorders — they’re simply sexual preferences for “unusual” behavior — and paraphilic behavior is only engaged in from time to time. Yet paraphilic disorder, by definition, involves non-consenting partners and causes suffering or confusion. Of all of the random Quebecois surveyed, almost half expressed interest in at least one type of paraphilia, and about one-third had actually acted on those desires at least once. Interest in voyeurism, fetishism, frotteurism, and masochism, in particular, was high enough — at 15.9 percent of both men and women surveyed — to be considered “statistically unusual.” Oddly — or perhaps not — masochism was significantly linked to a more satisfying sex life. Although men were generally more interested in paraphilic behavior than women, the authors point out that women who were interested in sexual submission were actually more drawn to more diverse sexual interests. Original Large Genitalia Could Lead to Extinction It’s time to reassess how we define normal and anomalous sexual behaviors, the authors write. Labeling paraphilias as abnormal, when they aren’t in the practical sense, could stigmatize and shame when it’s unnecessary — which is something the DSM has more than enough experience with. Lest readers think the Quebecois are simply a rarefied, sexually liberated bunch, the authors point out that they “have reasons to believe that this study’s results which are based on Quebec’s population can be applied to the population of North America and Europe as well.” ||||| Do you have normal sexual tastes? A new study suggests sexual fantasies, urges and behaviours that are often considered abnormal are actually quite common among the general population, raising questions about how psychiatrists and psychologists define what is sexually normal or not. The study, published online in The Journal of Sex Research, examined the prevalence of paraphilic, or anomalous, sexual interests, as identified in the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), among residents of Quebec. It found that participants’ experiences and their desire to experience certain paraphilic behaviours, including fetishism and masochism, are neither rare nor unusual. While some paraphilic behaviours, such as pedophilia, exhibitionism and voyeurism, are illegal and involve a non-consensual party, certain others should not be labelled abnormal, says the study’s co-author, Christian Joyal, a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivières and the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal. “If people are happy, if everybody is consenting, I don’t know why it should be abnormal, especially in 2016,” Joyal says. The researchers used online and telephone surveys to ask 1,040 Quebec residents, aged 16 to 64, about their sexual desires and behaviours. Nearly half the respondents reported a desire to experience at least one paraphilic behaviour and around a third of them had engaged in a paraphilic behaviour at least once. The most common was voyeurism – surreptitiously watching strangers when they are nude, undressing or having sex. That was followed by fetishism – sexual arousal by an inanimate, non-sexual object; frotteurism – touching or rubbing oneself against a stranger; and masochism – sexual arousal while suffering, being dominated or humiliated. The researchers note that the current edition of the DSM, updated in 2013, defines normal, or “normalphilic,” sexual interest as “interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners.” Anything else is not necessarily disordered, but is considered paraphilic or abnormal, Joyal says. “Normalcy is really difficult to define and I don’t think it’s a good idea to try to do it,” he says. The DSM offers eight examples of paraphilic interests: voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, masochism, sadism, pedophilia, fetishism and transvestism. While interests such as fetishism are far from uncommon, Joyal says, other sexual interests such as pedophilia, necrophilia and bestiality are extremely rare. He explains that a paraphilic interest can be considered a mental disorder if it causes suffering or impairment. The study looked at what are known as merely “anomalous” interests, and not disorders. “Just asking people about their sex lives, I know it’s a bit taboo,” he says. “But still … you have to have evidence-based data before coming [up] with any definition, especially [with] such a sensitive topic like sexual behaviours.” Report Typo/Error ||||| The \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" trilogy has made kinky sex mainstream, romanticizing the use of whips, chains, and handcuffs. Couples worldwide are buying BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Dominance, Submission, Sadism and Masochism) sex toys, with sales up 400 percent in 2012. Sexual fantasies of being spanked or whipped, tied up, or forced to have sex have become commonplace, especially in women, but are these interests and behaviors abnormal? In a recent study published in The Journal of Sex Research, researchers at the University of Montreal found sexual preferences classified as “anomalous” (abnormal) in psychiatry are actually very common, suggesting there is no such thing as “normal” when it comes to sex. \\"The main goal of the study was to determine normal sexual desires and experiences in a representative sample of the general population,\\" said co-author Christian Joyal, in a statement. Joyal and his colleague Julie Carpentier, both in institutions affiliated with the University of Montreal, surveyed a diverse group of over 1,000 Quebec residents on the phone and online about their sexual tastes and interests. The respondents were asked if they enjoyed sex acts that were considered anomalous by the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Sex acts and behaviors listed as “paraphilic,” or atypical, include but are not limited to, voyeurism (joy of watching others have sex), fetishism (sexual arousal toward inanimate objects or body parts), frotteurism (dry-humping), and masochism (pleasure from pain or ridicule). The findings revealed nearly half of the respondents were interested in at least one type of sexual behavior considered an anomalous paraphilia, whereas one third had experienced the behavior at least once. Out of the eight types of paraphilic behaviors listed in the DSM-5, four (voyeurism - 35 percent, fetishism - 26 percent, frotteurism - 26 percent, and masochism - 19 percent) were found to be common when it came to experiences or desires reported by men and women. Although men tend to be more interested in paraphilic behaviors than women, women do have a strong interest. According to Joyal, women who report an interest in sexual submission have more varied sexual interests and report greater satisfaction with their sex lives. “Sexual submission is therefore not an abnormal interest,\\" he said. An earlier study, also conducted by Joyal, found many women who have extreme submission fantasies, such as domination by a stranger, clearly state that they don’t actually want the fantasies to come true. More women than men fantasize about their current romantic partner. Clinically speaking, pathological sexual fantasies involve non-consenting partners, include pain, and are necessary for deriving satisfaction. But aside from that, what exactly is the definition of abnormal or atypical fantasies? For example, half of the behaviors in Joyal’s recent study are legal, but frotteurism, for instance, is not because it’s by definition non-consensual. This study suggests that some legal paraphilic behaviors are not as abnormal as previously thought, which is contrary to what is suggested by the DSM-5. So when it comes to sex, the concept of normality can't truly exist because sexual satisfaction is personal. Source: Joyal CC and Carpentier J.

Movie title: Flight of the Navigator Context: On the night of July 4, 1978 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 12-year-old David Scott Freeman walks through the woods to pick up his 8-year-old younger brother Jeff from a friend's house when he accidentally falls into a ravine and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he discovers that it is now the year 1986; while he hasn't aged at all, his parents are now middle-aged and Jeff is 16 years old. Meanwhile, an alien spaceship crashes through power lines and is promptly confiscated by NASA. David is taken to a hospital for tests, but is sent to a NASA research facility when his brainwaves reveal images of the spaceship. Dr. Louis Faraday, who has been studying the spaceship since its arrival, discovers that David's mind is filled with alien technical manuals and star charts covering expanses of the galaxy far exceeding anything humans have recorded. David's subconscious mind tells the scientists that he was taken to a planet called Phaelon, 560 light years away, in just over 4.4 hours. They realize that David has experienced severe time dilation as a result of having traveled faster than the speed of light, explaining why eight years have passed on Earth, but not for him. David is unable to comprehend what Faraday tells him and flees the room, leaving Faraday muttering that 48 hours will be insufficient to finish his investigation. The next morning, following a telepathic communication from the ship, David secretly boards it and meets its robotic commander called \\"Trimaxion Drone Ship\\" (or \\"Max\\" for short), which refers to David as the \\"Navigator\\". After they escape from the facility, Max tells David that its mission was to travel across the galaxy, collect biological specimens, take them to Phaelon for analysis, and then return them to their homes. Phaelon's scientists discovered humans only use 10% of their brain and, as an experiment, filled the remainder of David's with miscellaneous information.

I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks.

While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B.

How much control does a sitting President have over economic growth during his or her term? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The President of the United States has significant control over military affairs and economic growth during their term in office. However, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as each topic involves distinct areas of presidential influence. 1. Control over military affairs: The President serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. This authority grants the President substantial power in managing and directing military affairs. Some of the key areas in which a President exercises control over military matters include: - Military Strategy: The President, in conjunction with the Pentagon and other branches of the military, is responsible for establishing and approving military strategy. They must evaluate current threats and assign resources to address those threats, both domestically and internationally. - Deployment of Military Forces: The President has the authority to deploy U.S. troops and order military actions as part of their role as Commander-in-Chief. This can include the use of force to protect the nation's interests, responding to international crises, or intervening in other countries' conflicts. - Authorization of Military Budget: While Congress ultimately approves the military budget, the President has significant input in the process. The President and their administration establish goals and priorities for the military and work with Congress to secure funding to support those objectives. - Appointment of Military Leaders: The President nominates top military personnel, such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense. These positions play a pivotal role in shaping military policy and managing military operations. - Nuclear Weapons: One of the most profound responsibilities of the President is their authority to order the use of nuclear weapons. The President has sole authority to launch a nuclear strike after consulting with advisors. 2. Control over economic growth during a President's term: The President has several tools at their disposal to influence economic growth. While they don't have direct control over all aspects of the economy, their decisions and policies can have a substantial impact. Some ways in which a President can influence economic growth include: - Fiscal Policy: The President proposes an annual budget to Congress, which outlines the administration's priorities and plans to fund federal programs and services. This budget can have a significant impact on economic growth by determining the level of government spending and investment in various sectors, such as infrastructure, education, and research and development. - Monetary Policy: While the President does not directly set monetary policy, they do appoint the members of the Federal Reserve Board, including the Chair. The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy through interest rate adjustments and other measures, which ultimately influence the overall economy. - Tax Policy: The President can propose changes to the tax code, which can foster or hinder economic growth. Tax incentives and reductions can stimulate growth by encouraging investment and consumer spending, while increases in taxes may have the opposite effect. - Regulatory Policy: The President shapes regulatory policy through the executive branch, impacting various industries and sectors of the economy. Easing or tightening regulations can have implications for businesses, job creation, and overall economic growth. - Trade Policy: The President plays a prominent role in guiding trade policy. Through negotiations and agreements, they can open markets for U.S. goods, protect domestic industries, or create new trade opportunities. Trade policies can significantly influence economic growth through export and import levels, job creation, and overall competitiveness. In conclusion, the President of the United States holds considerable power over both military affairs and economic growth during their term. They can shape and implement policies in these areas, although their decisions are subject to various checks and balances. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as each focuses on distinct areas of the President's influence and responsibilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Review: I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day... That's not to denigrate this film at all. It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping. But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was... I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs. What is the sentiment of this review?

They also commend the story, the believable characters and the soundtrack, suggesting an overall positive impression of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer reveals a close personal connection to the film, comparing their own childhood experiences with the protagonist's story, which adds another layer to their positive sentiment. The reviewer highlights the fun they had experimenting with rocketry in their backyard and watching Sputnik, just like the protagonist. Even though the film is described as a \\"basic family movie\\", the reviewer frames this in a positive context, arguing that this is a \\"dying breed these days\\" and recommending the film for viewing with children for a good laugh, which reinforces the overall positive sentiment.

With no chances left, Macha asks for help of Jake Green (Jason Statham), a card man with a good reputation underground. When Jake refuses, they harass Jake's brother, Billy (Andrew Howard), and Billy's family to convince Jake to play. He succumbs and plays the game, which he ends up winning. The loser, a high roller named George, insults Jake's mother and Jake responds by shooting him in the foot, igniting a gunfight in which the game's money vanishes. Two weeks later, Jake's name is mentioned and he is brought in for questioning by the police. Taking precautionary measures, Macha sends the three Eddies to Billy's house where they threaten his niece. Billy's wife reacts poorly in the situation and is accidentally shot. Jake does not give Macha's name to the police to protect Billy and his family and ends up sentenced to prison.

From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he proclaimed that African states should reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki. At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he called for a greater level of integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system and a single currency, utilising the slogan: \\"The United States of Africa is the hope.\\" In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed \\"King of Kings\\" by an assembled committee of traditional African leaders.

Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks: The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Answer: The name Fiona is rising in popularity particularly in German -speaking countries. Question: what is the origin of fiona Answer:","completion":"The origin of the name Fiona can be traced back to the Gaelic tradition and holds significant roots in the Irish, Scottish, and other Celtic cultures. The name is derived from the Gaelic word \\"fionn\\", which means \\"fair, pale, or white\\". Fiona is an apt choice to denote someone with fair features or light complexions, symbolizing a beautiful countenance in the speaker's mind. The name Fiona began to gain popularity in the 20th century primarily due to the works of Scottish author James Macpherson. In his series of poems published during the 1760s, Macpherson introduced a character named Fíona, who was the heroine in his Ossianic Cycle, drawing inspiration from Celtic mythology and the story of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, a legendary Irish hero. Macpherson's works sparked great interest, both artistically and academically, in Celtic cultures and managed to propel the name Fiona to new heights of popularity. By the 20th century, Fiona had become a popular choice for girls' names in the British Isles. However, the name did not emerge as a popular option in the United States until several decades later, around the 1990s. Since then, the name has been consistently popular, particularly in English-speaking countries, as well as in Northern Europe, especially in Germany, where it has seen a significant rise in recent years. The name Fiona has managed to maintain its allure and charm across generations, primarily due to its links to Celtic folklore and its soft, melodic sound. Today, it remains a popular choice for parents who are drawn to names that embody both grace and strength, as well as those who have an affinity for traditional or historical monikers. In conclusion, the origin of the name Fiona comes from the ancient Gaelic and Celtic cultures, derived from a word meaning \\"fair\\" or \\"white\\". The name's popularity began with the works of Scottish author James Macpherson, showcasing a beautiful character in his Ossianic Cycle, and has since been a popular choice for girls' names, especially in English-speaking countries and Northern Europe. Today, the name carries connotations of grace, strength, and historical roots that continue to appeal to parents around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select from the following. [1]. yes; [2]. it is not possible to tell; [3]. no;","completion":"The premise given states that the Stop & Shop was sold to a Dutch company for a profit of 1. Given this, there is a clear implication that there has been a profit involved in the transaction. The hypothesis \\"There is a profit of 1.00\\" is directly supported by the information provided in the premise. To understand this better, let's break down the provided statement. The Stop & Shop was sold for some unidentified price, but after deducting the costs involved in the transaction (possibly the buying price and other expenses like operational costs, marketing costs etc.) the leftover amount (or surplus value) was 1. This surplus is referred to as profit. Since the premise clearly states that a profit of 1 was made, it is safe to say that something was gained from this transaction, even if it was only a single dollar. The word \\"profit\\" signifies a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned from selling something and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing it. In this context, the profit made was 1 which clearly aligns with the hypothesis \\"There is a profit of 1.00\\".

Here is a question about this article: Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Write an article using the following points: Captive journalist John Cantlie calls video the \\"last in this series\\" Cantlie has appeared in previous ISIS videos. Article:","completion":"Title: Captive Journalist John Cantlie Appears in Alleged Final ISIS Video Introduction: British journalist John Cantlie, who has been held captive by ISIS since 2012, recently appeared in a video he called the \\"last in this series.\\" Cantlie has been featured in numerous propaganda videos by the terrorist group over the past six years. Step 1: Mention John Cantlie's background and the context of his capture John Cantlie, a talented and experienced British war reporter, was initially kidnapped alongside American journalist James Foley in November 2012 while covering the conflict in Syria. While Foley was tragically executed by ISIS in August 2014, Cantlie has remained a captive and unwilling participant in the group's propaganda efforts. Step 2: Describe Cantlie's role in previous ISIS videos Throughout the years, ISIS has exploited Cantlie's journalistic background to front various documentary-style videos, including a series titled \\"Lend Me Your Ears.\\" In these videos, Cantlie has delivered scripted messages critical of Western governments and policies, undoubtedly under duress. Step 3: Relate the significance of the \\"last in this series\\" message The recent video, in which Cantlie claims it to be the \\"last in this series,\\" has sparked concerns both for his safety and the potential cessation of the propaganda campaign that has kept him alive. This change in tone and the uncertainty that follows raises alarm among those who have followed his plight. Step 4: Explain the implications of Cantlie's appearance in the new video The fact that Cantlie has appeared in this new video suggests that he is still alive, albeit under the control of ISIS. The video's timing also confirms that the extremist group continues to use media as a tool for manipulation and fear-mongering, despite their diminishing territorial control. Step 5: Offer hope for Cantlie's release The ongoing efforts to liberate territory from ISIS control may increase the chances of locating and rescuing remaining captives, such as John Cantlie. International authorities and humanitarian organizations are closely monitoring the situation, with the hope that the end of Cantlie's forced involvement in ISIS propaganda campaigns could signal his eventual freedom and an end to his long ordeal. Conclusion: As the world anxiously anticipates what the future holds for captive journalist John Cantlie, the implications of his alleged final appearance in an ISIS video remain unknown. As ISIS continues to lose ground, authorities and organizations will work to secure the safe release of Cantlie and other captives, ending a terrifying chapter in their lives and bringing closure to their families and friends who have relentlessly hoped for their safe return."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: Cutting down trees has a negative impact on an ecosystem.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: A New Era for St. Paul's Church in Staverton: A Priceless Gem Awaits a New Guardian The centuries-old St. Paul's Church in Staverton, Wiltshire, has had a rich and storied history, having stood proudly since the 13th century. Serving as a beacon of faith, solace, and contemplation for the local community, it has been an indispensable spiritual anchor for countless generations. However, recent years have seen the majestic structure face some new challenges. Attendance to the church has shrunk considerably, forcing the decision to close its doors. As the number of parishioners attending St. Paul's Church continued to fall, it became increasingly evident that the building required a new lease on life. Consequently, the Diocese of Salisbury made the difficult decision to put the historic church up for sale, commencing a new chapter in the life of the cherished structure. Despite this challenging turn of events, the graveyard surrounding St. Paul's will continue to serve the public. It remains accessible to mourners and visitors, offering a haven of peace and tranquility to those who wish to pay their respects. While the buyer will not own the graveyard, they will have the rare opportunity to safeguard and cherish a piece of architectural heritage. This elegant 13th-century structure is a testament to the craftsmanship and engineering skills of a bygone age. It stands proud, with its robust stone walls, soaring arches and elaborate stained glass windows. The distinctive bell tower graces the skyline, serving as a reminder of the rich cultural past that permeates the sleepy village. Being entrusted with such a landmark presents a unique opportunity for an individual or organization to renovate, restore, and breathe new life into it. The new custodians will have the chance to adapt this stunning building for a variety of purposes while preserving its essence and respecting its spiritual roots. Notably, the sale of St. Paul's Church is not an isolated incident. A recent survey conducted by the National Churches Trust found that almost half of all adults in the United Kingdom have not attended a place of worship in the last year. This shift in attendance patterns has put numerous historical churches at risk, both in terms of maintenance as well as the continuity of their religious and community functions. For many, the thought of losing these architectural gems is unbearable, as they are symbols of our cultural heritage and an integral part of the British landscape. As a society, it is imperative that we find creative solutions for the reuse and maintenance of these structures. Initiatives like the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance work tirelessly to ensure a sustainable future for these distinctive edifices while championing adaptive re-use and development projects. As St. Paul's Church in Staverton awaits its new owner, one can't help but hope that the building will continue to flourish as part of the living fabric of the village, serving new purposes and meeting the evolving needs of its inhabitants. The sale of this landmark offers much more than a commercial transaction; it represents a rare opportunity to preserve history, restore a priceless gem, and make a tangible, lasting impact on a community that has treasured it for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ford Field, located in Detroit, Michigan, was the venue for the Basketbowl on December 13, 2003. This unique event was a college basketball game between the University of Michigan Wolverines and the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The game attracted a record-breaking crowd, with 78,129 people in attendance, setting the world record for the largest audience at a basketball game at the time. Ford Field, which opened in August 2002, encompasses 1.85 million square feet and has a seating capacity of 65,000, which can be expanded to accommodate larger events such as concerts, conventions, and other specialty events like the Basketbowl. The stadium is also well-known as the home of the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions. The Detroit-Wayne County Stadium Authority is a public entity created in 1970 to finance and oversee the construction, operation, and maintenance of the professional sports stadiums owned by Wayne County in the Detroit metropolitan area, including Ford Field. The Authority is governed by a seven-member board, with representatives appointed by the Wayne County Executive, the Mayor of Detroit, and the Governor of Michigan. The Ford Motor Company, an American multinational automaker headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, secured naming rights to the stadium in November 2000 for a 20-year term at a cost of 40 million. As the sponsor, the automaker has the right to have its name and logo prominently featured at the stadium, which helps create a strong association for their brand with sports and entertainment activities held at Ford Field. In conclusion, Ford Field, the domed stadium that hosted the Basketbowl event, is owned and operated by the Detroit-Wayne County Stadium Authority, a public entity established to oversee the stadiums in the Detroit metropolitan area. The naming rights were secured by the Ford Motor Company, but the ownership remains with the Authority, making it the responsible party for the operations and maintenance of the venue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Indian protesters attack Domino’s near Mumbai after diplomat’s arrest, strip search Protesters furious at the arrest and strip search of an Indian diplomat in Manhattan last week attacked a Domino's Pizza store near Mumbai on Friday, demanding a ban on American goods and threatening to escalate what is already a diplomatic crisis. No one was hurt in the ransacking of the eatery in a suburb of the western Indian city, authorities said. Mumbai, also known as Bombay, is the diplomat's hometown. Police said they were stepping up patrols of major U.S. outlets, including McDonald's, in the wake of the attack, in which protesters shattered the pizza store's glass door. Earlier this week, protesters burned photos of President Obama and wore saris made from the American flag. Deputy Consul Devyani Khobragade, busted on charges that she lied to the United States on a visa application for her maid and then paid the maid just 3.31 an hour, has become a heroine to many Indians, with at least one political party urging her to run for parliament. \\"Whatever happened with her is condemnable,\\" said Azam Khan, a Samajwadi Party leader. \\"If she returns to India, we are ready to give her a ticket for the 2014 polls.\\" Experts said Indian politicians looking ahead to elections in 2014 are fanning the flames of outrage in the Khobragade incident order to score political points with patriotic voters. RELATED: INDIA DEMANDS U.S. DROP PROSECUTION OF DIPLOMAT Indian authorities have taken several retaliatory steps against American diplomats, even removing concrete barricades from the front of the U.S. embassy in New Delhi that protect against attacks. The U.S. State Department has tried to smooth things over this week, with Secretary of State John Kerry and other officials making phone calls to Indian authorities. But the Indian government remains angry, and the State Department won't ask Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to drop the charges against Khobragade. Many Indians are incensed at the idea that Khobragade, a woman and a senior diplomat, would be subjected to a strip search. But American officials said the practice is routine. Bharara, who is Indian-American, has taken a defiant stand in the case, stating that U.S. authorities treated Khobragade with respect. The prosecutor ripped his critics Wednesday night for sympathizing with the diplomat rather than her maid, Sangeeta Richard. Khobragade and Indian officials have accused Richard of trying to use the wage allegations to blackmail her employer for money and immigration papers. RELATED: INDIA FREEZES DUTY FREE IMPORT OF BOOZE FOR AMERICANS They say Richard stole items from Khobragade's home and ran away in June, and they contend the diplomat paid the maid exactly what she told the U.S. she would. Khobragade said that she wired a portion of Richard's salary directly to Richard's husband in India and that Richard received the rest in cash in New York. The diplomat's sister, Sharmistha, took to Facebook on Thursday to defend her sibling and to post a letter purportedly written by the maid, media reports said. The sister said that Richard was treated well, with two rooms to herself, a private entrance, the freedom to come and go as she pleased, a cellphone and an iPad. The letter that Richard ostensibly wrote home to India shortly after reaching the U.S. last November is upbeat, reports said. \\"I'm not feeling I'm her servant,\\" it supposedly reads in Hindi. \\"Madam is very nice. Every day she has a smile.\\" RELATED: INDIA RETALIATES AFTER DIPLOMAT'S 'BARBARIC' NYC ARREST It was unclear how Khobragade's sister obtained the letter that she says Richard wrote. In a release Thursday, Richard's American lawyer denied the blackmail allegations. \\"There was no extortion or anything along those lines. She essentially worked within the home and attempted to ask for more time off, ask for more reasonable hours, but those attempts to resolve the issues were unsuccessful,\\" Dana Sussman said. India has transferred Khobragade to its permanent mission to the United Nations in order to net her full diplomatic immunity, which her lawyer believes is retroactive. The U.S. contests that claim. Meanwhile, there were more than 20 protesters at the Consulate General of India in New York to support Richard.","completion":"Protesters in India attacked a Domino's Pizza store near Mumbai, fueled by anger at the arrest and strip search of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in Manhattan.

Victim: Nijole Siskeviciene was strangled in October 1998 near her home in Wembley, north London. James Kennedy, 54, denies murder. A convicted rapist strangled a woman to death but was not arrested for 12 years after sending police anonymous letters blaming two black men for the crime, a court heard. James Kennedy, 54, was charged with murder after he was stopped for drink-driving in July 2010 and police took a DNA sample from him. It matched saliva found on Nijole Siskeviciene, 44, whose body was discovered beside a garage in Wembley, north London, in October 1998, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled with a ligature, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said. Kennedy lived two doors away from the mother-of-one at the time and denied knowing her when interviewed by police in house-to-house inquiries. A week after the murder police received two anonymous letters from someone claiming to have seen two black men carrying out a girl from a house. When he was arrested at his home in Weston-Super-Mare in January this year, Kennedy - who now walks with a stick - said 'Oh my God' and was 'visibly shaken', the court heard. His DNA was found to match that on the letters and police found the same stationery in his home during a search, the hearing was told. Mr Bennetts said Nijole 'had marks to her body consistent. with having been held by her attacker about the throat and wrists and. injuries were consistent with a hand being placed over her mouth. Her underwear was inside out. 'Together with evidence of DNA upon her body and clothing, that evidence. is clear, say the prosecution, and consistent with there having been. sexual activity prior to, or at the time of her death.' The court heard that Kennedy was previously jailed for raping two women in his home town in Ireland in 1978. Then aged 21, he offered a 19-year-old a lift in his car and raped her and tightened a ligature around her neck until she passed out. He then threw her into a lake and when she tried to reach the shore threw rocks at her. His 23-year-old second victim was attacked a month later, and was raped while Kennedy held his hands around her throat. He pleaded guilty to the two rapes in 1979 and was jailed, the jury was told. Kennedy, who changed his name to Citro in 2003, denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice by sending the two letters to police. Mr Bennetts told the court: 'The prosecution case is based upon circumstantial evidence - DNA, differing accounts given by James Citro and letters written by him to divert attention from him. 'Why else would he write the letters?' The trial continues. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

In truth I'm too tired to turn for long. My face is sweaty, but I lie quietly listening to the cricket choirs outside that remind me of childhood. The neighbor's dog howls. Probably a passing squirrel. It's been years since I took the time to really listen to the night. I think about grandma, who lived to 92 and still helped with my mom's gardening until just a few weeks before she died. And then, I'm back there at her house in the summer heat of my childhood. I move my pillow to the foot of grandma's bed and turn my face toward the open window. I turn the pillow, hunting for the cooler side. Grandma saw me turn over and over. \\"If you just watch for the breeze ,\\" she said, \\"you'll cool off and fall asleep.\\" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus. Neighbors, porch -sitting late, speak in unclear words that calm me. \\"Mom, did you hear that?\\" my seven-year-old son cries, \\"I think it was an owl family.\\" \\"Probably,\\" I tell him, \\"just keep listening...\\" Without the working air conditioner, the house is peaceful, and the natural night noises seem close enough to touch. I hope I'm awake tonight when the first breeze comes in. Question: Which of the following titles best suits the passage? Options: A: Waiting for the Breeze. B: An Interesting Experience. C: Life at Present and Life in the Past. D: Different Times, Different Children A:","completion":"The title that best suits the passage is \\"A: Waiting for the Breeze.\\" This passage tells an evocative and immersive narrative about a family who decides not to use their air conditioning in order to reduce their electric bill, choosing instead to weather the heat and listen to the sounds of the world outside their windows. Despite the children's complaints, the author explores the serenity and connections that come from this naturalistic auditory experience, evoking memories of their grandmother and the wisdom she imparted about enduring the heat. \\"Waiting for the Breeze\\" not only captures the physical action that the family is doing, but it also encapsulates the emotional undertones of the story. It refers to the advice the narrator received from her grandmother about enduring the heat by seeking and waiting for a breeze, a metaphor that resonates throughout the passage. The other options \\"B: An Interesting Experience\\", \\"C: Life at Present and Life in the Past\\", and \\"D: Different Times, Different Children\\" all hold some relevance to the content of the article. However, none of these titles truly capture the transformative experience that the author outlines, which involves waiting for the breeze, listening to the sounds of nature, and finding comfort in the deeper connections being formed with the world outside. In its entirety, the narrative is not just an interesting experience, a reflection of then and now, or a comparison of children from different times. It encases a worldview, a sense of longing, and the realization that comfort can sometimes be found in the most unconventional places, just by waiting for the breeze to come in. In conclusion, while there are several possible interpretations for the text, the title that best reflects the meaning of the story and carries the essence of the narrative is \\"A: Waiting for the Breeze\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

This is a very busy city with lots of cars and people always in a hurry to get to different places. One of the motorcyclists got into some trouble with a man driving a big car called an SUV. When people get angry, sometimes they don't think before they act, and they can make bad choices. The motorcyclist did something that made the man in the big car very upset. They started to yell at each other and got even more angry. Suddenly, they both acted without thinking and made some bad decisions. The motorcyclist got really mad and did something to the man's SUV that left another motorcycle rider hurt and needing to go to the hospital. Hospitals are places where doctors and nurses help people feel better when they are hurt or sick. The hurt motorcycle rider was taken to the hospital so the doctors and nurses could help him get better. But, the story doesn't end there. The man in the big car was also very upset, and he got out of his car to yell some more at the motorcyclists. This was not a good idea, because when people are angry, they sometimes don't know how to talk nicely to each other. Some of the other motorcycle riders saw the man yelling at their friend, and they decided to join in. They were angry too, and started to fight with the man from the SUV, which led to him getting hurt. After the fight, the motorcyclists left and the hurt man had to find help so he could feel better. Now, many people have heard what happened and the police have gotten involved. The police are people whose job is to keep everyone safe and make sure people follow the rules. They heard what happened on the road between the motorcyclists and the man in the big car and decided that it wasn't right. So they started looking for the person who started all the trouble. The police found one of the motorcyclists who was part of the angry group. Police decided to arrest him because he did not follow the rules and hurt other people. Arresting is when the police take someone to a place called jail, where they have to stay until they can fix the problems they caused. In the end, many people learned a very important lesson: when we get angry, it's important to remember to be kind to others and think before we act. That way, we can avoid getting into big trouble and make sure everyone stays safe and happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A Tory holds a political philosophy (Toryism) based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \\"God, King and Country\\". Tories generally advocate monarchism, are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage, and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction. In Britain, the Tory political faction originated with the Cavaliers during the English Civil War. This political philosophy remains prominent in the politics of the United Kingdom, and also appears in parts of the Commonwealth realms, particularly in Canada. It also had exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War. Under the Corn Laws (18151846) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency, and enhanced wages in rural employment. - The United Kingdom is a unitary state with devolution governed within the framework of a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state and the prime minister of the United Kingdom, currently Theresa May, is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the British government, on behalf of and by the consent of the monarch, as well as by the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, and the Northern Ireland Executive. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. - The Corn Laws were measures enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846, which imposed restrictions and tariffs on imported grain. They were designed to keep grain prices high to favour domestic producers. The laws did indeed raise food prices and became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural Britain. The Corn Laws imposed steep import duties, making it too expensive to import grain from abroad, even when food supplies were short. The laws were supported by Conservative landowners and opposed by Whig industrialists and workers. The Anti-Corn Law League was responsible for turning public and elite opinion against the laws, in a large, nationwide middle-class moral crusade with a Utopian vision. - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms. As of 2017, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Barbados, Grenada, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, and the United Kingdom. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - William Gordon , 2nd Earl of Aberdeen ( 1679 -- 30 March 1746 ) , known between c. 1691 and 1720 as Lord Haddo , was a Scottish peer , Tory politician and Jacobite . Gordon was the second son of the 1st Earl of Aberdeen and following the Acts of Union 1707 , was elected to the House of Commons for Aberdeenshire in 1708 .

His father was a television repairman and a United States Marine Corps veteran of World War II and the Korean War. His mother worked at a record store. Danzig and his family also spent some time living in Revere, Massachusetts. In the mid-1970s, Danzig started the Misfits, releasing the band's records through his own label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, only to be told that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band's name comes from Marilyn Monroe's last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a \\"social misfit.\\" In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: \\"It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren't prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn't seem to have the same outlook. So it was time for me to move on.\\" After the Misfits, he began work on a new band project: Samhain. The origins of Samhain began when Danzig started rehearsing with Eerie Von, formerly of Rosemary's Babies. Danzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year, which influenced the evolution of the modern Halloween. Initially Samhain was conceived as a punk rock \\"super group\\". The band briefly featured members of Minor Threat and Reagan Youth, who contributed to Samhain's 1984 debut, Initium. The band then settled with a lineup consisting of Eerie Von on bass, Damien on guitar, and Steve Zing on drums (later replaced by London May). In 1985 the Unholy Passion EP was released, followed by November-Coming-Fire in 1986. Samhain eventually began to attract the interest of major labels including Epic and Elektra.

Ludovic (Ludo) Coeck (25 September 1955 – 9 October 1985) was a Flemish-Belgian footballer who played as left winger or central midfielder. His clubs included Berchem Sport, Anderlecht, Internazionale and Ascoli Calcio. He was capped for the Belgian national team 46 times. Can we draw the following conclusion? . He was capped for the Belgian national team a number divisible by 23 times. OPTIONS: i. Yes ii. It's impossible to say iii. No","completion":"To determine if Ludo Coeck was capped for the Belgian national team a number divisible by 23 times, we can start by understanding what \\"divisible by 23\\" means: A number is divisible by 23 if it can be evenly divided by 23 without leaving a remainder. In other words, when the number is divided by 23, the result is an integer. Now, let's examine the given information: Ludo Coeck was capped for the Belgian national team 46 times. To check if 46 is divisible by 23, we can perform the division: 46 ÷ 23 = 2 Since 2 is a whole number, we can conclude that 46 is indeed divisible by 23. So, we can draw the conclusion: Yes, Ludo Coeck was capped for the Belgian national team a number divisible by 23 times. The correct answer is: i. Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do.

Question: In which year is civilization on the brink of collapse ? Movie plot title: Children of Men Movie plot: In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility, civilization is on the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other Fishes. He discovers that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so Luke could take over as leader, that they intend to kill Theo in the morning, and that they intend to use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution.

Article: October 15, 1970 was declared International White Cane Safety Day (IWCSD) for the first time by the President of the International Federation of the Blind (IFB).

Peguilly d'Herbemont was born on 25th June 1888 into an old French noble family of the same name. In her youth she led the conventional and protected existence, lack of great activity, of a girl from a \\"good family\\", an existence reminding of the life of the aristocracy before the French Revolution. She never visited a public school, but was educated by German and English governesses and nuns. Her movements were restricted and were mainly confined to the family positions in Paris and Belgium, but she spent most of her time at the castle of Charmois not far from Verdun. In the process of helping individual blind people across the road, Peguilly d'Herbemont was made aware by narrow scrapes which almost led to accidents, of the dangerous situation of the visually impaired brought about by the steadily increasing traffic on the roads. She first spoke about measures to protect the blind against street hazards to her mother in 1930, but she was of the opinion that it was unfit for a lady of good society to create a public outcry and advised her to stick to the transcription of books, a popular pastime of ladies of rank at the time. But the idea did not leave her. The urgent wish to encourage the integration of the blind into society by providing them with a means of moving about more freely without endangering others, and at the same time attracting the attention of passers-by ready to offer assistance, caused her to take the unusual step of writing to the editor of the Paris daily Echo de Paris in which she suggested issuing the blind of the Paris region with white sticks similar to...

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Write an article based on this \\"ScotRail had to pay out more than £2,000 a day in compensation to passengers during a period of disruption to services.\\"","completion":"Title: ScotRail Pays Over £2,000 Daily in Compensation During Service Disruptions Introduction: Recent reports have revealed that ScotRail, the primary rail operator in Scotland, had to pay out more than £2,000 a day in compensation to passengers during a period of disrupted services. This news highlights ScotRail's commitment to customer service and the importance of efficient public transportation systems. In this article, we will discuss the reasons for the service disruptions and the impacts on passengers, as well as examine ScotRail's response and future plans to improve services. Step 1: Discuss the reasons for the service disruptions: ScotRail faced a series of service disruptions due to various factors such as weather conditions, infrastructure issues, and staff shortages. These factors led to delays, cancellations, and overcrowded trains, leaving many passengers stranded or forced to make alternative travel arrangements. It's important to recognize that some of these factors were outside of ScotRail's control, while others point towards areas in which the company can invest and improve. Step 2: Explain the compensation process and figures: During the period of disruption, ScotRail compensated affected passengers by providing refunds or alternative transport options, depending on the individual circumstances. As a result, the total amount of daily compensation paid reached over £2,000. This figure demonstrates ScotRail's dedication towards customer satisfaction and their willingness to make amends when services do not meet expectations. Step 3: Talk about the effects on passengers: The disruptions impacted many passengers' daily commutes, business, and personal travel plans, leading to a rising tide of frustration and disappointment. The compensation payments, however, provided some solace to affected individuals and somewhat alleviated their grievances. Nevertheless, the real desire of the passengers remained consistent: for ScotRail to improve its services and avoid such disruptions in the future. Step 4: Explore ScotRail's response and plans for improvement: Acknowledging the problems faced by its passengers, ScotRail has announced plans to invest in infrastructure improvements, staff training, and better communication with its customers. By addressing these key areas, the company aims to minimize the potential for future service disruptions and enhance overall customer experience. Step 5: Conclude the article: Despite the unfortunate disruptions, ScotRail's approach to compensating affected passengers demonstrates the company's commitment to customer satisfaction. As they move forward with improvements, the focus should remain on providing reliable, efficient, and comfortable public transportation services that keep pace with the growing needs and expectations of passengers."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me.

One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. The writer believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. natural shampoos scent does not stay on the hair B. chemical shampoos leave hair looking greasy C. not enough information D. natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well Answer:","completion":"D. natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's this horrible, so-called Gen Y, that is full of bored idiots, some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films like these show just how stupid young, so-called \\"filmmakers\\" can be when they believe going out with no script, no direction, no thought, no legit \\"camerawork\\" (everything shot horribly on DV), no craft of editing, no nothing, stands for \\"rebellious\\" or \\"advanced\\" film-making.

This cat loved to play and explore. One day, while the cat was playing outside, it was shot by a small pellet gun. A pellet gun is like a toy gun that shoots little round objects called pellets. But sometimes, these pellets can hurt animals, like our friend, the cat. When the cat was shot, it got hurt in its eye, and it needed help. Its loving family saw this and quickly took the cat to a special doctor called a veterinarian. A veterinarian is a doctor for animals, like how you have a doctor when you don't feel well. The veterinarian looked at the cat and decided that in order for the cat to feel better and be safe, its hurt eye needed to be removed. The cat went through an operation, which is a special process where doctors carefully help fix parts of your body that are sick or hurt. In this case, the veterinarian removed the cat's hurt eye. After the operation, the cat needed some time to rest and heal. With the love and support of its family, the cat slowly started to recover and feel better. Even though the cat now had only one eye, it didn't stop being its happy and playful self. In fact, the cat learned to adapt very well and continued to live a wonderful life. Just like people, animals can be very strong and brave, even when they face tough challenges. In the end, the cat's family and friends were very happy to see their one-eyed little friend feeling better and playing again. The story of this brave and strong cat teaches us that love, support, and good care can help anyone get through difficult times.

Write an article based on this summary: Women may be deterred from entering politics because of abuse suffered by female MPs, Diane Abbott says. Article:","completion":"Title: Women in Politics: The Deterrents and Impact of Abuse on Female MPs Introduction: In recent years, as more women have entered the world of politics, many have been faced with a disturbing reality: abuse and harassment. Former Shadow Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Diane Abbott, has brought attention to this alarming issue, stating that the level of abuse directed towards female MPs may be deterring other women from pursuing political careers. This article explores the experiences of female MPs and the potential implications of ongoing harassment and abuse for the future of gender equality in politics. Abuse faced by female MPs: Historically, women have been underrepresented in the political sphere. As more women emerge as political leaders and attempt to break through the glass ceiling, many face an overwhelming amount of abuse, primarily through online channels such as social media. Hate speech, threats, and harassment are all too common for women in politics, with Abbott herself sharing her own harrowing experiences. In 2017, research conducted by Amnesty International revealed that Abbott received almost half of all abusive tweets sent to female MPs during the UK general election. The Shadow Minister's own experiences are reflective of a larger issue - the misogynistic and targeted abuse female politicians face on a regular basis. Potential deterrents for women entering politics: When considering the prevalence of abuse directed towards female MPs, it's unsurprising that this could serve as a deterrent for other women considering political careers. Not only does this abuse negatively affect the mental health and well-being of those bearing the brunt of it, but it may also discourage more women from entering the political arena in fear of facing similar treatment. Impact on gender equality in politics: If the abuse faced by female MPs ultimately deters others from entering politics, this could have significant ramifications for gender equality. Greater female representation in politics is critical for ensuring a broader range of perspectives, balanced decision-making, and the fair representation of all members of society. By limiting the number of women entering the political sphere due to the fear of abuse and harassment, progress towards true gender equality becomes significantly more challenging to achieve. Conclusion: The abuse faced by female MPs, such as Diane Abbott, serves as a stark reminder of the barriers that continue to exist for women in politics. It is essential for leaders, elected representatives, and relevant organizations to recognize the significant impact of this abuse and take appropriate measures to counter its effects. Devising strategies to better support female politicians, raising awareness about the challenges they face, and prioritizing the creation of a safer political environment could help encourage more women to enter politics - ultimately fostering greater gender equality and making politics more representative of the society it serves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Keep a dream journal. Notice the world around you. Fall asleep. Conjure your crush.","completion":"Title: Harnessing the Power of Your Imagination: The Art of Manifesting Dreams and Manifesting Love Introduction Our minds hold a great deal of untapped potential that we can use to improve and evolve our lives. By utilising the power of our imagination, we can manifest dreams and attract the people we desire most, including our crushes. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to keep a dream journal, increase awareness of your surroundings, use sleep to foster vivid dreams, and ultimately bring your crush into your life using a combination of enhanced awareness and imagination. Step 1. Keeping a Dream Journal One of the most effective ways to strengthen your connection to your dreams and imagination is by keeping a dream journal. A dream journal can help you remember your dreams, understand their meanings, as well as improve your ability to manipulate your dream environment. To get started, follow these simple steps: 1. Choose a notebook or an electronic device such as a phone, tablet or computer for recording your dreams. 2. Place your selected journaling tool within easy reach of your bed, so you can access it as soon as you wake up. 3. As soon as you wake up, record anything that you can remember from your dreams, including details of people, places, emotions, themes, and anything that stood out to you. 4. Make it a habit to review your dream journal regularly. You can analyze similarities between dreams and identify patterns, emotions, and recurring themes. As you continue to record your dreams, you'll find that your recall and subconscious awareness improve, allowing you to explore and control your dreamscape further. Step 2. Noticing the World Around You Being present and fully aware of your surroundings is a crucial aspect of manifesting your dreams and desires. Practicing mindfulness will increase your ability to focus your thoughts and attract the right people and circumstances into your life. Here are some ways to become more aware of the world around you: 1. Practice meditation regularly. This will help you discipline your thoughts and improve your ability to concentrate. 2. Spend time in nature, observing sights, sounds, and smells. The process of immersing yourself in your environment can help in grounding your awareness. 3. Engage all of your senses in daily activities. Pay attention to textures, flavours, and sensations, as this helps sharpen your focus on the present. 4. Challenge yourself to notice new and unique details of your daily routine, such as the colour of a neighbour's front door or a new flower in bloom. Enhancing your awareness of the world around you serves to sharpen your connection to your imagination, which in turn helps in manifesting your dreams. Step 3. Utilizing Sleep to Foster Vivid Dreams Sleep has a significant impact on our brain function, memory, and our ability to dream. To make the most out of your sleep and optimize your dreaming experiences, follow these tips: 1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, falling asleep and waking up at the same time each day. 2. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night, for optimal mental and physical well-being. 3. Limit exposure to electronic devices and bright lights a few hours before bedtime. 4. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing deep breathing exercises. Healthy sleep habits will ensure that your brain is well-rested and ready for vivid dream experiences, providing you with the ideal environment to practice manifesting your desires. Step 4. Conjure Your Crush Now that you have a strong connection to your dreams, heightened awareness of your surroundings, and optimal sleep habits, you are ready to manifest your crush into your life. Visualize your crush in great detail, focusing on their appearance, their personality, and the emotions they evoke in you. Imagine encounters with them, as well as how they would respond to discussions and events. During moments of deep relaxation, such as meditation or right before falling asleep, maintain a strong mental image of your crush and the emotions surrounding your connection to them. It's important to pair your visualization with positive intentions and feelings of love, gratitude, and excitement for your imagined future together. Keep in mind that the purpose of this exercise is not to control another person's feelings or actions, but to harness the power of your imagination and manifest your desires into the physical world. Stay open to the idea that the universe may surprise you by delivering something even better than what you had initially envisioned. In Conclusion By exploring the power of your dreams, developing presence and awareness, and harnessing the art of visualization, you can manifest your desires, including your crush, into your reality. By establishing a strong connection between your subconscious mind and heartfelt intentions, you can create a world that is abundant with love and joy."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It's understandable that she would be feeling regretful and upset about her actions, as she has not only hurt Christine's friend but also damaged her own reputation among their friend group. Given the situation, it's important for Sarah to now take responsibility for her wrongdoings and seek support to help prevent such actions in the future. In the meantime, Christine is also very remorseful, as she feels she didn't act quickly enough when she learned of Sarah's behavior. She questions whether she could have intervened earlier and potentially saved her friend from further heartache. Acknowledging this, Christine understands that it's crucial to communicate openly with friends and listen to any concerns they may have, helping to maintain trust and prevent similar situations from happening again.

Please answer the following question: Jeremy is performing some chores around the kitchen when he decides to pour himself some water into a blue cup. However, this water isn't cold enough so he puts it into the freezer to cool it down. He then pours himself the exact same amount of water in a red cup, but gets a phone call and leaves that cup on the table without taking a sip. He comes back two hours later after the phone call to get his cups of water back. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cup is more likely to get a crack in it? Hint: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.) A:","completion":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, the blue cup is more likely to get a crack in it. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Jeremy pours water into a blue cup and places it in the freezer to cool it down. 2. The water in the blue cup will start to freeze, turning into ice. 3. As the water turns into ice, its volume increases due to the unique properties of water mentioned in the hint. This expansion of ice can create pressure against the walls of the blue cup. 4. The red cup, on the other hand, has been left on the table undisturbed with the same amount of water, which remains in a liquid state and does not expand. 5. Comparing the two cups, the blue cup with the expanding ice has a higher chance of getting a crack due to the increased pressure caused by the ice. Hence, the blue cup is more likely to get a crack in it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Passage:Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau. Links: a. Bahram Chobin b. Vistahm c. Battle of Blarathon d.

Background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. Paragraph: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate.

Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted.

For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement . - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism. - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

It's because people tend to stay closer in winter and the cold virus is _ from one person to another through handshakes, sneezing, or coughing. While there is no actual cure for the common cold, scientists say there are still a few things you can do to help you. Some experts say honey and chicken soup are effective against colds. Especially honey. There is increasing evidence that it helps shorten the duration of the common cold sometimes even by two to three days particularly in children. Chicken soup also helps reduce the duration of the cold. In addition, if you do have a cold and you don't feel like eating anything, it's not going to hurt you but you have to drink a lot and you can drink water or tea because doctors say the water cycle in your bodies helps to cure colds. That's very important. Though there is more than one way to deal with colds, doctors say the best advice is to continue using whatever works best for you. It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian opposition activists called mass protests for Friday to test a fragile, day-old ceasefire by President Bashar al-Assad's forces, and international pressure mounted for Damascus to fully comply with a U.N.-backed peace plan. Anxious to build on a truce between the armed forces and rebels which brought an eerie calm to Syria on Thursday, after more than a year of clashes, the U.N. Security Council worked on a resolution authorizing U.N. observers to monitor it. World leaders welcomed the halt in fighting which had threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the situation looked calmer. \\"The world is watching, however, with skeptical eyes since many promises previously made by the government of Syria have not been kept,\\" he told a news conference in Geneva. Along with the withdrawal of forces from population centers, U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan calls for talks with the opposition aimed at a \\"political transition\\", the release of political prisoners, access for humanitarian aid and journalists, and for the authorities to \\"respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully\\". Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), said he did not trust the authorities to allow the renewal of protests after Friday prayers, a feature of the uprising that has been subdued by violence in recent months. The authorities, he said, had their \\"hand on the trigger\\". \\"While we call on the Syrian people to protest strongly... we ask them to be cautious because the regime will not respect the ceasefire and will shoot,\\" he told Reuters. AUTHORISED PROTESTS The Syrian Interior Ministry said only pre-authorized demonstrations would be permitted by police, a caveat which the opposition said did not bode well. \\"This is ridiculous,\\" said an activist called Musab from Hama city, a focus of opposition activity and government bombardment along with Homs and Idlib. \\"They will not give you permission and you will be taken to jail if you ask for it\\". He said a demonstration on Wednesday in the town of Qalat Madiq, in Hama province, had been broken up by security forces firing, and nine people were arrested. Most independent media are banned from Syria, making such reports impossible to verify. In Homs, where opposition stronghold districts were all but deserted, activist Yazan expressed doubt people would dare to go out because snipers, tanks and soldiers were still in place. \\"People are wary and they believe that this ceasefire is only temporary. Nobody is leaving their homes,\\" he said. The SNC's spokesman said Assad could simply not afford to stop shooting, since that would allow a new wave of mass protests against his family's four decades of absolute power. \\"As soon as there is a real ceasefire, people will come out to the streets, demonstrating and demanding his removal, his stepping down. So I think the regime has to retaliate by opening fire again,\\" spokesman Bassam Imadi told Reuters in Istanbul. \\"But let's hope for the better.\\" OBERVER DEPLOYMENT Annan, mandated by the United Nations and Arab League, has called for 200 to 250 unarmed U.N. observers to monitor the ceasefire. A similar Arab League mission ended in disarray amid mounting violence in January, but Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the 15-member Security Council could adopt a resolution authorizing the deployment of a U.N. observer force as early as Friday. \\"The full-fledged mission will take some time to deploy ... If we are able to put 20 or 30 monitors (there) early next week, very good,\\" Churkin said. \\"If we are able to put more in the next few days that's even better.\\" A draft resolution drawn up by the United States would have the Council authorize an initial deployment of up to 30 observers and demand the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from population centers and an end to violence on all sides. It included a vague threat of future action against Damascus, saying the council \\"expresses its determination, in the event that the Syrian government does not implement its commitments, to consider further measures as appropriate\\". It was not immediately clear how Russia and China, which vetoed two previous resolutions condemning Assad's 13-month assault on anti-government protesters, reacted to the draft, which diplomats discussed behind closed doors on Thursday. Most of the demands in it were addressed to the Syrian government, which could irritate Moscow and Beijing. Both have welcomed the ceasefire while emphasizing the requirement for rebel forces to comply. The United States and European Union have imposed their own sanctions against Damascus after failing to persuade Russia and China to join in. Moscow and Beijing are wary of further U.N. moves, alarmed by the way last year's Security Council resolution on Libya led to military intervention, though Western leaders are also cautious about intervening in Syria's mix of religious and ethnic groups. Ban said there had been a surge in Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkey and Lebanon this week and an estimated 1 million people inside Syria now needed humanitarian assistance. He was urging Assad to keep his promise and to exercise maximum restraint, he said. \\"This ceasefire process is very fragile - it may be broken any time if, and when, there is another gunshot,\\" Ban said. \\"This is a very worrisome.\\" (Additional reporting by Louis Charbonneau and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles in Geneva, Oliver Holmes and Douglas Hamilton in Beirut, Michael Holden in London and Balazs Koranyi in Oslo; writing by Philippa Fletcher; editing by Jon Boyle) ||||| Activist groups said at least five people were killed when Syrian troops opened fire on demonstrators and on civilians returning to their homes, and President Bashar al-Assad's government accused “terrorists” of carrying out two bombings and an assassination in which at least two people died. It was clear, however, that Syria was quieter than it has been for months, leading to cautious hope that the six-point peace plan proposed by the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan may help end the bloodshed and usher in a negotiated settlement to the country’s 13-month-old uprising. “Syria is apparently experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground,” Annan said in a statement from Geneva. “This must now be sustained.” In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton cautioned that the cease-fire could be considered only “a fragile first step.” “Sporadic fighting continues in parts of Syria,” she told reporters at a Group of Eight meeting. Assad's forces “have not pulled back, and he has not taken any action on any of the other points.” The United States is now pushing for a speedy resolution at the United Nations that would oblige Assad to comply with all the requirements of the six-point plan, including the withdrawal of troops from cities, access for humanitarian aid and journalists, and permitting peaceful protests, she said. “The Annan plan is not a menu of options,” Clinton said. “They cannot pick and choose.” The United States circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations that would establish an advance team of up to 30 U.N. monitors to observe the cease-fire. The council is expected to follow up in the coming weeks with a second resolution that would establish a full-fledged monitoring mission with as many as 250 monitors, most of them recruited from other U.N. missions in the region. There was broad consensus in the 15-nation Security Council about the need to support Annan’s request for U.N. monitors, and Russia’s U.N. envoy, Vitaly Churkin, said it was possible the council could approve the mission by Friday. Whether the lull in violence signaled any more than a pause was in question. The sustained shelling of residential areas loyal to the opposition that had killed hundreds of people in recent weeks came to a halt, but there was no indication that the government had pulled its forces out of the cities. Such a move could trigger a revival of the mass demonstrations that shook the country in the early months of the uprising, and the government appeared intent on preventing the opposition from taking advantage of the cease-fire to call people onto the streets. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Syrian opposition activists called for mass protests to test the fragile ceasefire by President Bashar al-Assad's forces while international pressure mounted for Damascus to comply with the U.N.-backed peace plan.

Archaeologists have uncovered treasure buried by the desperate citizens of a town under siege by the Roman army some 2,000 years ago. Hundreds of bronze coins, and various items of gold, silver and bronze jewellery were found beneath an ancient fortress in the Crimean settlement of Artezia, in modern day Ukraine. Researchers believe the loot was hurriedly buried by wealthy people sheltering from the attacking Roman legions who were backing one side in a civil war. Buried for 2,000 years: Archaeologists have uncovered hoards of buried treasure hidden beneath a Black Sea fortress by residents who were facing the might of Rome's legions during a destructive civil war. 'The fortress had been besieged. Wealthy people from the settlement and the neighborhood had tried to hide there from the Romans,' said Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University. 'They had buried their hoards inside the citadel.' As the Romans highly trained and well equipped soldiers attacked people huddled in the citadel for protection, however Professor Vinokoruv told LiveScience they knew they would not survive. At the time of the siege and fall of the fortress in 45AD, Artezian was a part of the Bosporous Kingdom where a rivalry was playing out between two brothers for political control. The elder, Mithridates VIII, wanted to win independence from the Roman Empire, while his younger brother Cotys wanted to keep the kingdom as a client state. Roman soldiers soon arrived to support Cotys' claims to the throne. They established his regime in the Bosporan capital and torched settlements controlled by his brother, including Artezian. Hellenistic culture: These two rings are engraved with the images of Greek gods. The people of the region borrowed many aspects of their culture from Greek colonists who had established outposts in the are hundreds of years before. A silver brooch depicts Aphrodite, goddess of love: Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals. Professor Vinokurov's team have been recruiting volunteers to study the town since 1989. It covered an area of at least 3.2 acrea, including a necropolis where many finds have been made. Archaeologists' work in the area has revealed that the people of Artezian followed a culture that was distinctly Hellenistic. Professor Vinokurov said that although the ethnicity of Artezian's residents was mixed, 'their culture was pure Greek. They spoke Greek language, had Greek school; the architecture and fortification were Greek as well. 'They were Hellenes by culture but not that pure by blood.' Write caption here. Ancient decorated spindles were also found on site: The Romans arrived in support of Cotys I, a usurper to the throne of the Kingdom of Bosporous, who asked for their help with deposing his older brother. Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals. Their customs and crafts seem to have endured through the intervening years despite being practised nearly 600 miles from Greece itself. This influence can be seen in the treasures the people of Artezia concealed as they waited for the final assault from their Roman enemies. Among the finds is a silver brooch engraved with an image of Aphrodite, Greek goddess of love, as well as gold rings set with gems on which are engraved images of Nemesis and Tyche, both also Greek deities. Dig: Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University, has been leading expeditions to the Artezian site for archaeologists and volunteers since 1987. Peeling back the past: The fortress at Artezian was torched by the Romans in 45AD, then later rebuilt - but it's treasure remained undiscovered until now. Excavations of other portions of the site, which was razed to the ground by the attacking army, have revealed further evidence that the people of Artezia had a Greek culture. 'In the burnt level of the early citadel, many fragmentary small terra cotta figures were found depicting Demeter, Cora, Cybele, Aphrodite with a dolphin, Psyche and Eros, a maiden with gifts, Hermes, Attis, foot soldiers and warriors on horseback, semi-naked youths,' the researchers wrote in their paper, published this month in the journal Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia. The town was later rebuilt by Cotys I, who successfully managed to dispatch his brother with Roman help, but the treasures of its earlier inhabitants have remained untouched until now.
