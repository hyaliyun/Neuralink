What emotion might the person be experiencing here ?","completion":"The person in the text appears to be experiencing a range of emotions, including fear, discomfort, determination, and urgency. Let us analyze the passage to understand the various emotional cues. Firstly, the description of the environment and physical sensations provides some insight into the emotions felt by the individual. The cold and surprisingly strong force, along with the jagged pieces of metal poking into the person's cheek, indicate that they are experiencing discomfort, and possibly, even pain. This physical sensation of discomfort and pain might evoke feelings of fear or anxiety in the person, as they may worry about the potential harm that the situation may cause to their body. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the extent of their injury (questioning if their skin is tearing) suggests feelings of vulnerability and insecurity. The person is in a physically compromised situation and is unsure about the consequences of it. This uncertainty adds to the emotions of fear and anxiety, as they feel exposed and helpless in the face of this dangerous environment. Despite these overwhelming emotions, the person manages to pull themselves together and take action - yanking themselves away and shifting the debris to help see better. This behavior demonstrates determination and a sense of urgency. The person seems to be aware of the danger they are in and feels compelled to find a solution or a way out. They are driven by an innate desire to survive and protect themselves from further harm. In conclusion, the person in this passage is most likely experiencing an array of emotions that include fear, discomfort, vulnerability, determination, and urgency. These emotions are intertwined as the person navigates through a hazardous situation, driven by a need to protect themselves and find a solution amidst the chaos. The contrast between their vulnerable state and their determination to take action highlights the complexities of human emotions and showcases the resilience of humans in challenging circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? This is what we know so far about Rachel Proctors life","completion":"The corrected version of the sentence, with appropriate punctuation, is as follows: \\"This is what we know so far about Rachel Proctor's life.\\" In the original sentence, Proctor's is spelled as Proctor s. An apostrophe is used to show possession, indicating that the life being discussed belongs to Rachel Proctor. The correct usage would therefore be \\"Proctor's\\". Punctuation can often change the meaning of a sentence, so it's crucial to use it correctly. In this case, without the apostrophe, it isn't clear that the life referred to is owned or associated with Rachel Proctor. The apostrophe helps prevent this confusion. Moreover, the final full stop (.) notates the end of the sentence. It indicates a full stop in thought and a clear break in the text. Using full stops correctly can aid in making the text more comprehensive and easier to read. Therefore, the sentence: \\"This is what we know so far about Rachel Proctor's life.\\" is the correct version.

Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate.

Answer the question...where have most fossils of australopithecus been found??","completion":"Australopithecus is a group of hominids that inhabited parts of Africa between approximately 4.2 and 2 million years ago. These early ancestors belong to our own human family tree and represent a crucial stage in human evolution. The discovery and study of Australopithecus fossils have played a vital role in understanding our early human ancestors and the environments they lived in. Most fossils of Australopithecus have been found in Eastern and Southern Africa, specifically in the countries of Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa. These regions boast various sedimentary basins that have preserved the fossil remains, facilitating their discovery and study. Some of the most famous and significant sites where Australopithecus fossils have been unearthed are: 1. Great Rift Valley (Eastern Africa): The Great Rift Valley is a massive geological fault system that extends from the Middle East through Eastern Africa, consisting of countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is known for its extensive collection of hominid fossils, particularly those belonging to Australopithecus. Some crucial fossil discoveries from this region include: a. Ethiopia: The Afar Triangle or Afar Depression, located in the northeastern part of the country, is home to the Hadar site. The Hadar site yielded numerous Australopithecus afarensis fossils, including the iconic \\"Lucy\\" skeleton discovered in 1974, and the \\"Selam\\" juvenile specimen found in 2000. b. Tanzania: The Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli sites in Tanzania have also produced significant Australopithecus fossils. The Laetoli site is particularly famous for the discovery of a set of 3.6-million-year-old hominid footprints, attributed to Australopithecus afarensis, preserved in volcanic ash. c. Kenya: Important fossil sites in Kenya include West Turkana, specifically the Lake Turkana region and Koobi Fora. Numerous Australopithecus fossils, such as the Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, have been found in these regions. 2. Cradle of Humankind (South Africa): The Cradle of Humankind site, located near Johannesburg, is one of the most significant paleoanthropological arenas in Africa. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it spans over 180 square miles and features several limestone caves. It is best known for Australopithecus africanus fossils. Some of the well-known fossil discoveries from this area include: a. Taung Child: Found in the Buxton Limeworks near the town of Taung in 1924, this is the first-ever discovery of an Australopithecus fossil. It comprises a partial skull and brain endocast of a young individual, Australopithecus africanus. b. Sterkfontein Caves: Located near the town of Krugersdorp, the Sterkfontein Caves have contributed significantly to our understanding of early hominids. Notable Australopithecus africanus specimens, such as \\"Mrs. Ples\\" and \\"Little Foot,\\" have been uncovered here. c. Swartkrans and Kromdraai: These are neighboring sites situated close to Sterkfontein Caves. Numerous Paranthropus (robust australopithecines) and early Homo fossils have been discovered here, offering a broader understanding of hominid diversity in the region. In summary, most fossils of Australopithecus have been discovered in Eastern and Southern Africa at various sites within Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa. These fossils have provided significant insights into the early stages of human evolution, helping us construct a better picture of our ancient hominid relatives and the environments they resided in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The decision by the British government to suspend flights to Kenya is regrettable, it plays into the hands of terrorists. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The British government banned flights to Kenya.","completion":"Yes, based on the given paragraph, we can quite conclusively determine that the sentence \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" is essentially true. The paragraph does not explicitly use the term 'ban', rather it states that the British government decided to 'suspend' flights to Kenya. While a suspension might technically be temporary and a ban suggests more permanence, in the broad sense, both actions lead to a halt or an interruption of flight services from Britain to Kenya. The implication from the paragraph is clear: the British government has strategically subjected travel to Kenya to an immediate halt. It's important to note that the reason behind the suspension is not stated. The paragraph only expresses regret over this decision, associating it to benefiting terrorists. However, the casual reader would interpret ‘suspension’ as synonimous to 'ban', but there are nuanced differences in wording where suspension might be temporary necessitated by situations such as weather conditions or immediate security threats, while a ban implies a more severe, often politically or safety motivated prohibition, typically for an undisclosed or extended period of time. In this regard, depending on the context and the desired precision of language, one might take issue with equating 'suspend flights' with 'banned flights'. But in terms of surface interpretation, readers would generally regard the two as more or less identical, as both imply an immediate cessation of flight operations between the two points - Britain and Kenya. Therefore, based on the lack of explicit time frames or detailed context, it is safe to view \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" as an accurate conversion of the original information in the paragraph for a majority of readers, while recognizing that the specific language may imply different things in specialized or official contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. and a hint : Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

Today’s kitchens easily supplant the bathroom as the home’s most dangerous room. While scalds and falls on tile can inflict serious harm in the bathroom, modern kitchen appliances and gadgets offer many more opportunities for injury. Even a seemingly simple kitchen task can result in a devastating injury. Just ask April Stewart Klausner, a New York illustrator and accomplished cook. Recently Ms. Klausner, 56, severed four tendons, multiple nerves and a blood vessel in her hand while pitting an avocado, something she’d done countless times. Gushing blood and unable to feel or move two fingers, she was taken by ambulance to an emergency room. The injury required more than three hours of surgical repair and many months of painful rehab. It will take at least a year for the injured nerves to heal, and Ms. Klausner can only hope her hand will function normally, enabling her to resume her career full-speed. The therapists at Lang Hand Therapy in Manhattan told her she was the fourth “avocado victim” they’d seen that month. “So add that to immersion blenders and mandolines . . . and maybe the bathroom is not the most dangerous room in the house!” Ms. Klausner said in an e-mail. Knowledge and mindfulness are the secrets to kitchen safety. My husband used to say, “From rushing no good can come.” Don’t try to do several things at once, and leave enough time to accomplish your tasks. Use timers, especially for foods that cook a long time. I use them for everything I cook. My favorite is the battery-operated West Bend Kitchen Timer, easily set by punching in the numbers for hours, minutes and seconds — a worthwhile investment. CUTS Knives are the most frequently used of hazardous kitchen tools. Two safety essentials: they must be sharp (dull knives are more likely to slip and cut the user), and they must be stored separately and safely in their own drawer (or divided section of one), in a wooden block or on a wall-mounted magnetic holder. I wash, dry and put away my knives as soon as I’m done using them. They should never be left lying on a countertop or in a sink full of water or other equipment. When slicing or mincing, keep fingers holding the food curled and out of harm’s way. Cut on a sturdy surface, moving the knife’s edge away from your body. Use the right knife for each task: a serrated blade, for example, is best for bread and safer for the person slicing it. Other sharp kitchen objects, like can lids, can cause nasty cuts. Be careful, too, when opening hard plastic packages, which often have sharp edges. Broken glass should be swept up with a broom and dust pan and disposed of posthaste. Do not use your hands; a damp but sturdy paper towel can be used to clean up tiny pieces of glass. BURNS Keep dry oven mitts near the stove and microwave, and always use them. Microwaved dishes can get extremely hot. Do not substitute dish towels for pot holders. Pot handles should be turned in toward the center of the range, away from the cook and passers-by, to prevent accidental tipping. Under a covered pot of boiling liquid, keep the gas flame low. Avoid steam burns by opening lids away from you. When cooking with hot oil, cover the pan with a spatter screen. Do not wear loose sleeves or flowing clothes while cooking, and tie up long hair. Note the shoes worn by professional chefs: clogs protect their feet in case hot water or oil spills on them. If you suffer a burn, immediately hold the injured area under cold water for several minutes. FIRES Do not leave or store flammable materials near the stove or in the oven. Make sure pots on open flames hold enough liquid, and use a trivet when placing a hot pot on a wood or fabric surface. Clean your oven often to keep it free of grease. If fats or oils catch fire, turn off the heat immediately but don’t try to pick up the pan. Never pour water on a grease fire; use salt or baking soda. Better yet, keep a fire extinguisher handy and know how to use it. FALLS Unnecessary climbs are a recipe for disaster. Keep often-used equipment and heavy pots within easy reach, and use high cupboards only for infrequently needed items and food products. Never stand on chairs. Invest in a sturdy stool with wide steps and rubberized foot pads. I used my wooden stool safely innumerable times until one morning it literally let me down. I landed hard on my back and narrowly missed cracking my head on a doorjamb. Wipe up all spills immediately lest they result in a human spill. I keep sponges and microfiber cloths handy for use on floors only. Leave no tripping hazards on the floor, including shoes and loose throw rugs. Though costly, cushioned rubber mats at the sink and food prep area are safer and more comfortable. ELECTRIC SHOCKS Modern kitchens are replete with electric tools that can result in life-threatening shocks if the power plug comes into contact with water. Read all warning labels and obey them. Use polarized plugs, and do not overload outlets. Dry your hands before plugging in and using appliances, and be sure to unplug an appliance before cleaning it. Hold the plug when pulling it from the socket; do not pull on the cord. POISONING Cleaning products should never be stored in the same cabinet as foods, medications or supplements. My grandmother nearly poisoned herself when she mistakenly drank cleaning fluid, thinking it was Milk of Magnesia; both were milky fluids in blue bottles, and she could not read English. Never transfer cleaning supplies to unmarked or emptied food containers. CHILD SAFETY Children are innately curious and can easily get into trouble in the kitchen the minute you turn your back. If you have young children, grandchildren or friends or relatives who visit with children, keep cabinets containing cleaning products and potent seasonings secured with a safety lock. Never cook with a child in your arms or baby carried in a sling. Best to have a safety seat in the kitchen to secure the child while you are cutting food or cooking. Never leave a toddler loose in the kitchen when no adult is present and paying attention. If children want to help with food preparation, give them age-appropriate tasks and supervise the undertaking. A 2-year-old can add cherry tomatoes to the salad; a 6-year-old can be taught how to cut soft vegetables; a 10-year-old may be able to slice meat.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: The first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon (from carbonized paper or bamboo). Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \\"flashing\\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \\"graphitized\\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage. What is the answer to this question: What material were the first light bulb filaments made from?","completion":"The first successful light bulb filaments were made from carbon. These carbon filaments were derived from carbonized paper or bamboo. This choice of material played a significant role in the early development of light bulbs, providing the necessary electrical and thermal properties required for the bulbs to function efficiently and effectively.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Cleopatra VII Philopator (69 August 12, 30 BC), known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt, briefly survived as pharaoh by her son Caesarion. After her reign, Egypt became a province of the recently established Roman Empire. - Raetia (or , , also spelled Rhaetia) was a province of the Roman Empire, named after the Rhaetian (\\"Raeti\\" or \\"Rhaeti\\") people. It bordered on the west with the country of the Helvetii, on the east with Noricum, on the north with Vindelicia, on the west with Transalpine Gaul and on south with Venetia et Histria. It thus comprised the districts occupied in modern times by eastern and central Switzerland (containing the Upper Rhine and Lake Constance), southern Bavaria and the Upper Swabia, Vorarlberg, the greater part of Tirol, and part of Lombardy. Later Vindelicia (today south-eastern Wuerttemberg and south-western Bavaria) formed part of Raetia. The northern border of Raetia during the times of Augustus and Tiberius was the River Danube. Later the Limes Germanicus marked the northern boundary, stretching for 166 km north of the Danube. Raetia linked to Italy across the Alps over the Reschen Pass, by the Via Claudia Augusta. The Romansh people living in Southeast Switzerland are believed to be direct descendants of the Raetians. However, the exact lineage of the Romansh (or Romansch) people remains incomplete. - Magnus Maximus (ca. 335 August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Aquileia ( Venetian: Aquieja/Aquiegia, ) is an ancient Roman city in Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in Antiquity as one of the world's largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the 2nd century AD. and is one of the main archeological sites of Northern Italy. - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Theodosius I (11 January 347 17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. - Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I. Though himself a Christian, he was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about . - Marcomer ( Marcomeres , Marchomer , Marchomir ) was a Frankish leader ( dux ) in the late 4th century who invaded the Roman Empire in the year 388 , when the usurper and leader of the whole of Roman Gaul , Magnus Maximus was surrounded in Aquileia by Theodosius I. The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander . According to this account Marcomer , Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania and Belgia in Gaul . They broke through the lines , killed many people , destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city Cologne panic . After this raid , the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty . Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods . When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus , Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier , they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of them . After this engagement Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country , however his army was surrounded and beaten . Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes , others were killed by Franks , few made it back to their Empire . Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus , who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks . Later , after the fall of Magnus Maximus , Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes , who was a general ( magister militum ) in the Roman army . The Franks delivered hostages as usual , and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier . A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries , he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania , because he hated his own kin . Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage . Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany . His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to... - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Noricum is the Latin name for a Celtic kingdom, or federation of tribes, that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia. In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, \\"Raetia\\" and \\"Vindelicia\\" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and \\"Italia\\" (\\"Venetia et Histria\\") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg. - The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the Final War of the Roman Republic, a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the promontory of Actium, in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt. - The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. - The La Tène culture was a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857. La Tène is the type site and the term archaeologists use for the later period of the culture and art of the ancient Celts, a term that is firmly entrenched in the popular understanding, but presents numerous problems for historians and archaeologists. The culture became very widespread, and presents a wide variety of local differences. It is often distinguished from earlier and neighbouring cultures mainly by the La Tène style of Celtic art, characterized by curving \\"swirly\\" decoration, especially of metalwork. - Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January 14, August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire. - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

Frédéric Chopin Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that \\"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form.\\" The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be \\"merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative\\". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; \\"instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure.\\" Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.

The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of Titan. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors.

Koscielny agrees new Arsenal deal Updated Jul 24, 2012 9:47 AM ET Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has agreed a new long-term contract with the Gunners. The 26-year-old France international joined Arsenal from Lorient in 2010 and has since established himself as a key member of Arsene Wenger's side. A statement on Arsenal's website read: \\"Arsenal football club is delighted to announce that Laurent Koscielny has agreed to sign a new long-term contract.\\" No details about the length of Koscielny's new contract were given. Koscielny has started 85 games for Arsenal over the last two years - no other player has started more at the club - and last year he earned his first call-up to the France squad. Since then, the former Guingamp and Tours centre-back has taken his tally of Les Bleus caps to four, the most recent of which came in the Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat to Spain, where he played the full 90 minutes in a 2-0 loss. Wenger said: \\"Laurent has been outstanding for us over the last two seasons. When you consider that until 2009 he was playing in Ligue 2 in France and that he is now performing at the very top level in the Premier League and for his country, the development that he has shown has been absolutely exceptional. \\"Laurent is a top-class player and I am very pleased he has decided to commit his future to the club.\\" Koscielny added: \\"I'm delighted to have reached agreement with the club.

Summarize the following: If the girl you’ve started chatting with is a stranger to you (or someone that you barely know), it’s important to find topics that you and her both have in common. For example, maybe you both go to the same school, live in the same neighborhood, or both study the same subject. Finding these commonalities will make further conversation more interesting. For example, ask: “What part of the state did you grow up in?” “What’s your major in college?” Pay attention during your conversation, and note which types of topics the girl seems to enjoy most, or which she expresses an interest in. Then, bring these up again later to continue the conversation and learn more about the girl. For example, if you know that she likes art, you could deliberately steer the conversation towards famous painters. Or, if the girl mentions an interest in soccer, bring up your own favorite soccer players or teams. The girl you’re speaking to will not enjoy the conversation if her only answers to your questions are “yes” or “no,” as these answers can quickly become repetitive or boring. Instead, come up with some questions that ask her about her past or make her think, and that will result in a longer, more complex answer. Try asking something like: “What movie or book character are you most like?” “What are some of your irrational pet peeves?” “What is an unusual fear or phobia that you have?” If you’re in the early stages of chatting with a girl and looking for ways to continue the chat, do not bring up topics that could lead to serious disagreement. Don’t make the girl uncomfortable with probing questions about her exes or past relationships, and also avoid sharing strong opinions on politics. Of course, if you and this girl end up getting to know one another better, these types of topics can lead to important and serious conversation.

The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.

State-level government: The mention of both the California State Senate and California State Legislature implies that these institutions are part of the state-level government in California, specifically dealing with making laws and regulations for the state. 5. Bicameral system: The fact that the California State Senate is mentioned as a \\"part\\" of the California State Legislature suggests that the legislative branch in California may follow a bicameral system, meaning there are two houses or chambers within the State Legislature. One of the chambers is the California State Senate, while the other chamber is not mentioned in the sentence but can be identified as the California State Assembly. 6.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. Step 1: Analyze the hint provided. The hint states that a large log burns slowly, while small twigs burn much more quickly due to the increased surface area they provide. Step 2: Recall the information about surface area and its effect on reactions. An increased surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction, and smaller particles have more surface area. Step 3: Compare the two groups of scientists and their fires. Group A used a large log and group B used small twigs. Step 4: Apply the hint and the information about surface area to the two groups. Since the small twigs used by group B provide a greater surface area, they will burn more quickly and provoke a more intense reaction than the large log used by group A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It uses a focused invisible beam that causes an \\"intolerable heating sensation\\", but only penetrates the skin to the equivalent of three sheets of paper. The discomfort causes whoever it's pointed at to immediately start moving away. They often scream but the US military says the chance of injury from the system is 0.1%. It's already been tested more than 11,000 times on around 700 volunteers. Even reporters have faced the heat-ray. Limit deaths Lt. Col. John Dorrian, a US military spokesperson, says the kit is now in Afghanistan but no decision has yet been made on its use. There's been much talk about the need to keep civilian casualties in Afghanistan to a minimum. The heat ray gun could help. The beam produced by the ADS can travel more than 500m (1,640ft) and is seen as an important new way to limit unnecessary deaths and minimise war zone casualties. Developers also say it could also be adapted to other operations, like fighting drug smuggling at sea and general peacekeeping operations.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? Answer:","completion":"It seems that you might be referring to a particular scenario involving someone named Kendall who addressed the flaws in some light-related context and came up with a solution. Without more specific information about the situation, it is difficult to provide an accurate response. However, I can still offer a general perspective on how others might feel as a result of Kendall's actions. If Kendall genuinely identified flaws in a light-related system, design, or concept and effectively provided a solution to fix those issues, then others might feel a variety of emotions as a result: 1. Appreciation: People who were affected by the flaws or those who found them annoying may appreciate Kendall's effort to acknowledge the issue and work towards resolving it. They would likely be grateful for the improvement in their experience or environment. 2. Respect: Some individuals may respect Kendall's skills, dedication, and problem-solving abilities, as solving a problem often requires critical thinking and expertise in a particular area. 3. Inspiration: Observers or teammates might feel inspired by Kendall's actions to address problems proactively and create positive changes when they encounter similar situations in the future. 4. Relief: In some cases, issues with lighting (e.g., flickering, poor color rendering, inadequate brightness) can cause discomfort, inconvenience, or even health issues. If Kendall's solution successfully addressed these concerns, people who were affected may feel relieved. 5. Skepticism or resistance: There might also be individuals who question the necessity or value of the changes Kendall implemented. They may be skeptical about the effectiveness of the solution or worry about potential implications (e.g., costs, adaptability) on a larger scale. It is essential to note that these emotions may vary depending on the context, the nature of the flaws, the proposed solution, and the way Kendall presents their findings and ideas. In real-life scenarios, people's feelings and reactions can be quite diverse and complex, and it's crucial to consider everyone's unique perspective when introducing changes or improvements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: \\"What is the use of the 'this' keyword in Java?\\" Question 2: Why use super keyword in java? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer both questions, let me first explain the keywords individually and then compare them. Question 1: \\"What is the use of the 'this' keyword in Java?\\" Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'this' keyword in Java is used as a reference to the current object of a class. It helps to differentiate between instance variables and local variables with the same names within a constructor or method. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java public class MyClass { int variable; public MyClass(int variable) { this.variable = variable; } } \`\`\` In this example, 'this.variable' refers to the instance variable, while 'variable' refers to the local variable passed to the constructor. Question 2: Why use the super keyword in java? Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'super' keyword in Java is used to reference the parent class's methods or variables, especially in cases of overridden methods or constructors. It allows access to the methods or variables of the immediate parent class. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java class Parent { int number; Parent(int number) { this.number = number; } } class Child extends Parent { int number; Child(int number, int childNumber) { super(number); this.number = childNumber; } } \`\`\` In this example, the 'super(number)' in the Child class constructor calls the constructor of the Parent class. Now, let's address if questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Step 3: Compare the keywords. While 'this' refers to the current object of a class, 'super' refers to the parent class's methods or variables. Although both keywords serve to differentiate between variables with the same name, they navigate different relationships in the class hierarchy. Step 4: Provide conclusion. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the usage of the 'this' keyword for current object references, while Question 2 is concerned with the use of the 'super' keyword for parent class references."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The first time I went for a walk around my father-in-law's neighborhood was garbage day, and I was shocked to see what people were throwing out. It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight.

Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s.

Article: For acute (short-term) ovarian cyst pain, a pain medication may be sufficient to relieve the pain until symptoms resolve. If the pain persists for two to three menstrual cycles, if it is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, or is growing, you will likely be advised to proceed with surgery to have your ovarian cyst(s) removed. The vast majority of ovarian cysts are benign. Either just the cyst can be removed from the ovary, or the entire ovary can be removed. The extent of the surgery will depend upon the number of cysts present on the ovary, as well as the age of the patient and reproductive considerations. (The surgery is generally more extensive following menopause.) Fortunately, if the entire ovary needs to be removed surgically, there is still the ovary on the other side, so the woman does not need to lose her fertility by having a surgical procedure performed. if there is any suspicion that it may be cancerous. Another key factor in deciding whether or not surgery is needed as a treatment for ovarian cyst(s) is assessing the cyst(s) for the possibility that they may one day become cancerous. If there is the risk of them developing into a cancer, your doctor will advise that surgery be performed to prevent this from occurring. When an ovarian cyst(s) is removed due to the possibility of it becoming cancerous, it is advised to have the fallopian tubes and uterus removed in addition to both ovaries. This, of course, has reproductive implications that need to be discussed with your doctor, because having all of these structures removed will make you infertile. If your ovarian cyst(s) is not yet showing signs of persistent pain and/or a risk for cancer, your doctor will likely advise that you try the approach of \\"watchful waiting.\\" This consists of using pain medications as needed to relieve your ovarian cyst pain, while hoping that the cyst ultimately resolves itself without the need for medical intervention. You must, however, commit to thorough follow-up with serial ultrasounds. This will ensure the cysts don't get worse. If the cysts do not improve with time, surgery may be advised.

Question 1: Why should the sleeping pulse be recorded in hyperthyroidism? Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the importance of recording the sleeping pulse in cases of hyperthyroidism. Step 2: Gather relevant information Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormone, which can lead to various symptoms, including a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Step 3: Analyze the information The sleeping pulse, or resting heart rate, can serve as an indicator of a person's overall health and fitness. In cases of hyperthyroidism, an elevated resting heart rate can be a sign that the body is producing too much thyroid hormone. Step 4: Respond to the question The sleeping pulse should be recorded in hyperthyroidism because it can help reveal if a person's heart rate is abnormally elevated due to the overproduction of thyroid hormone. Monitoring the resting heart rate can assist in diagnosing and managing the condition. Question 2: Has anyone ever used vita pulse?

Kristhielee Caride filed a 3 million lawsuit Thursday in which she demands the return of her crown and the multiple gifts she won, including a car, plastic surgery and a seven-day cruise. She was stripped of her title nearly a month ago. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and contractual damages. It was filed against PR Crown Entertainment and officials including Desiree Lowry, national director of Miss Universe Puerto Rico. Lowry's attorney, former Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Antonio Sagardia, told The Associated Press that he declined to meet with Caride's attorneys at their request. \\"There's nothing to talk about,\\" he said. \\"Our decision is final.\\" Caride's attorney, Ernie Caban, did not return a call for comment. Caride was stripped of her title after she was criticized for being dismissive and saying she did not love cameras in an interview with a local newspaper. \\"That's like an athlete saying, 'I don't like to train,'\\" Sagardia said. Lowry told reporters at the time that Caride never apologized and said only that she was having personal issues and that such an incident would not happen again. However, Lowry said Caride then canceled other appearances because of a doctor's appointment she refused to reschedule. The lawsuit says Caride underwent an unspecified surgical intervention in late February and needed to rest for a month. It said she then made a required public appearance and did not wear unspecified, required post-operation accessories on Lowry's orders. The lawsuit also states that a friend of Caride's suffered a hemorrhage during that time and it affected her emotional state. The lawsuit says Caride was briefly hospitalized for depression after she was stripped of her title. Caride said in a Facebook post last month that beauty queens are not exempt from bad days and that she allowed her feelings to come before her job. She apologized and said she was turning over her sash even though she disagreed with the decision.

Q: Passage: While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum? , can you please find it? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.

One day while she was walking in the woods she found two starving songbirds. She took them home and put them in a small cage, caring them with love. Luckily, the birds grew strong little by little. Every morning they greeted her with a wonderful song. The girl felt great love for the birds. One day the girl left the door to the cage open accidentally. The larger and stronger of the two birds flew from the cage. The girl was so frightened that he would fly away. So as he flew close, she grasped him wildly. Her heart felt glad at her success in capturing him. Suddenly, she felt the bird go weak, so she opened her hand and stared in horror at the dead bird. It was her desperate love that had killed him. She noticed the other bird moving back and forth on the edge of the cage. She could feel his strong desire--needing to fly into the clear, blue sky. Unwillingly, she lifted him from the cage and threw him softly into the air. The lucky bird circled once, twice, three times. The girl watched delightedly at the bird. Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss. What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder. It sang the sweetest tune that she had ever heard. Remember, the fastest way to lose love is to hold on it too tight; the best way to keep love is to give it wings! What can we learn from the passage? A) Catch what you can catch on your way to success. B) Going too far is as bad as not going far enough. C) East or west, home is best. D) A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Answer:","completion":"The passage primarily teaches us about love and freedom, and how too much attachment or control can harm or even destroy the object of your affection.

This reflects the idea that while the girl's intentions were good, her overbearing love and desire to hold onto the bird were what ultimately caused its demise. The story further emphasizes that love thrives in freedom, as indicated by the second bird's return, and that true love should not be constricting but should give freedom. So the message is that balance is crucial, either too much or too less can lead to adverse outcomes; and love should be selfless, not binding.

Article: Recently a research was carried out in London,Birmingham and Leeds among teachers from different schools about student behavior management. The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers. Teachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The time people in Silicon Valley wake up varies as it depends on personal preferences and work schedules. While there isn't an exact uniform time for everyone living in the region, patterns can be observed. Many tech professionals working in Silicon Valley are known for being early risers. Some famous entrepreneurs like Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, reportedly wake up around 4 or 5 am. This is partly because many of them adhere to the belief that they can be more productive by starting their day early. However, other individuals in the tech industry might prefer to work late into the night and wake up later in the day. Employee schedules will vary depending on the company's culture, the nature of work, and personal preferences. Coming to the second question, the number of start-ups in Silicon Valley is continually changing given the dynamic nature of the tech sector. As a major global hub for innovation, venture capital, and technology, the region has thousands of start-ups operating within its ecosystem. According to a report published in 2021 by Startup Genome, the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley combined form the number one start-up ecosystem worldwide. It is estimated that there are over 14,000 start-ups in this entire area. However, it is important to note that these numbers fluctuate regularly as new companies emerge, while others are either acquired or shut down. Silicon Valley remains an attractive destination where entrepreneurs from around the world come to build and scale innovative businesses. Regarding the similarity of the two questions, while both address aspects of life in Silicon Valley, the questions have distinct meanings. The first question inquires about the typical waking time of people residing in the region, whereas the second question asks about the number of start-ups operating in Silicon Valley. Both questions provide insights into the lifestyle and professional environment of individuals living and working in this world-renowned technology hub, but the focus of each question is different.

Article: Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner as flat-ironing hair may cause damage to your hair. Shampooing and conditioning will remove unwanted oil and product build-up from your hair. Look for shampoo and conditioner products that are sulfate-free and jam packed with glycerin. Glycerin helps reduce frizz as it penetrates hair follicles, hydrating hair from the inside out. The closer glycerin is to the front of the ingredients list, the more it contains. Use a gentle shampoo and a smoothing conditioner. Straightening can be damaging to hair, even if your hair is thick and curly, so gentle products are important. When leaving in the conditioner in the shower, use a paddle brush to comb through your hair. This will help with the smoothening process while in the shower. Co-washing means washing your hair with only conditioner. Hair that's thick or curly is prone to more dryness than average hair. If your hair is very dry and frizzy, you should try co-washing your hair before straightening it. Your hair may benefit from being co-washed a few times a week. Shampoo can remove a lot of the natural moisture from hair. Using conditioner may reduce your hair's dryness. As straightening your hair can cause it to dry out, co-washing may be very helpful for someone with thick or curly hair. To co-wash your hair, saturate your hair with water. Then, massage in your chosen conditioner. Give your hair three to five minutes to absorb the conditioner and then wash it out. Do not rub! Wet hair is very weak and prone to damage. Blot the hair gently, and lightly wring the ends to soak-up moisture. Dry until it is slightly damp. Pat the hair downwards to promote straightening. Towel-drying in different directions enhances curls. Allow your hair to dry 90% of the way before you blow-dry. Concentrated hot air can frizz your hair. If you don't have either, use a small amount of the conditioner or a dime-sized amount of olive oil. These coat your hair to prevent the intense heat from causing split ends. Don’t overdo it. Too much leave-in conditioner can make your hair limp instead of straight. Wash your hair with only conditioner twice a week to keep from washing away natural hair oils. Use argan oil for thick hair. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: To protect and care for your hair when flat-ironing, use gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and smoothing conditioner that contain glycerin to reduce frizz and hydrate hair.

Question: suppose the renal artery is obstructed happens, how will it affect nephrons filter more blood. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less If the renal artery becomes obstructed, it will negatively affect the nephrons' ability to filter blood. The renal artery is responsible for supplying blood to the kidneys, where the blood undergoes filtration through millions of nephrons. Nephrons are the key functional units of the kidneys and are responsible for the filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes that remove waste products and excess substances from the blood to maintain the body's electrolyte balance and blood volume. When the renal artery is obstructed, the blood flow to the kidneys is significantly reduced. This reduction in blood flow results in less blood reaching the nephrons for filtration. Consequently, the nephrons will not be able to filter blood as efficiently as they would with a normal, unobstructed renal artery. The ability of the nephrons to maintain a proper balance of electrolytes and blood volume in the body will also be compromised. The reduced filtration rate impairs the kidneys' overall function, potentially causing a buildup of waste products and toxins in the blood, which can be harmful to the body. Additionally, the diminished blood flow may lead to renal ischemia, a condition in which the kidney tissues receive inadequate oxygen supply. This decrease in the nephrons' filtration capacity may manifest in various symptoms and complications, including hypertension (due to the kidneys' inability to remove excess fluids), an increased risk of kidney disease, and a higher susceptibility to kidney failure if the obstruction is not addressed promptly. Therefore, it is vital to identify and treat any renal artery obstructions to ensure that the kidneys and nephrons can continue to efficiently filtrate blood, maintaining overall health and body functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Moorish Spain, also known as Al-Andalus, was an important intellectual center where scholars from various religious backgrounds interacted, shared, and translated works in multiple disciplines such as philosophy, science, and medicine. Moors, who were Muslims of North African and Iberian Peninsula descent, played a crucial role in this exchange of knowledge. They translated many works, particularly from ancient Greek and Arabic to Latin, which was the scholarly language of medieval Europe. This allowed European scholars to access previously unavailable knowledge, ultimately contributing to the European Renaissance. Jewish and Christian scholars, such as Benedictine monks, also contributed significantly to the translation efforts. Jewish scholars, who were proficient in Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin, were particularly indispensable as they acted as intermediaries between the Islamic and Christian worlds. Benedictine monks, committed to the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, often collaborated with Jewish and Moorish scholars, transcribing and translating texts into Latin. One of the well-known instances of such collaboration is the School of Translators in Toledo, Spain. Here, translation teams composed of Jews, Moors, and Christians actively exchanged knowledge and engaged in translating important texts. These teams translated works by notable ancient Greek philosophers and scientists, such as Aristotle and Galen, as well as Arab scholars like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. To summarize, the hypothesis \\"Moors never undertook any translation work.\\" is not only false, but it is also directly contradicted by the premise \\"Jews, Moors, and Benedictine monks worked alongside each other in translation teams.\\" Historical evidence shows that Moors actively participated in translation work, collaborating with Jewish and Christian scholars. These collaborative efforts were essential in the intellectual development of Europe and laid the foundation for the European Renaissance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Irish Cyclists Support Hillsborough Victims, Face Unfortunate Theft Hi kids! Today, we are going to talk about a group of Irish cyclists who went to Liverpool to show their support for the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy. This was a very sad event that happened long ago, where many people were hurt during a big football game. These six kind cyclists wanted to help the people who were affected by this sad event. To have some fun, they parked their big van near a famous football stadium called Anfield. It's a very cool place where lots of football games happen. Then, they went inside to explore the stadium and enjoy a special tour. They were really excited about this! But, when they came back to their van, they found out that all their bicycles, special biking clothes, and other important equipment worth £30,000 were gone! That's a very big number, right? Someone had stolen their things while they were away. This made the cyclists very sad and upset. The people who have been working hard to help the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, also known as campaigners, were very angry when they heard about the theft. They said they were 'disgusted' by it, which means they thought it was a very, very bad thing to happen. They couldn't believe that somebody would steal from the kind cyclists who came all the way to Liverpool just to support the people in need. It's important to remember that helping others is a great thing to do, and it's sad when something bad happens along the way.

Established in 1916, the organization had approximately 1500 members and a paid staff of 4 in 2013. The former Mayor of Portland, Sam Adams, served as Executive Director 2013 to 2015. The current Executive Director is Julia Meier. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can reasonably conclude that the sentence \\"The City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit\\" is true. There are several reasons to support this conclusion. First, the text explicitly states that \\"The City Club of Portland is a nonprofit [...] civic organization.\\" Nonprofit organizations operate primarily to fulfill a mission or purpose, rather than generating profit for owners or stakeholders. Nonprofits can, and often do, generate revenue from various sources, but any surplus funds are typically reinvested in the organization to further its mission, rather than being distributed to owners or shareholders. As a nonprofit, the City Club of Portland is aligned with this model and does not have the primary goal of making a profit. Secondly, the City Club of Portland is described as a \\"nonpartisan civic organization.\\" Nonpartisan organizations are those that do not support or oppose any political party or candidate and strive to facilitate civic engagement, dialogue, and debate while remaining politically neutral. As such, the organization's primary focus is on promoting thoughtful discussion and informed decision-making among its members and the broader community, rather than pursuing profit-driven objectives. Lastly, the paragraph mentions that Julia Meier is the current Executive Director of the City Club of Portland. As the leader of a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization, Meier's role would typically involve overseeing the day-to-day operations of the organization, setting its strategic direction, and ensuring that it remains true to its mission and vision. While Meier may be responsible for the financial sustainability and overall success of the organization, that success would be measured in terms of how well the City Club of Portland achieves its intended outcomes (e.g., fostering civic engagement and discussion) rather than profit generation. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is accurate to say that the City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit. Instead, its primary purpose is to serve as a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization dedicated to promoting informed and unbiased discourse on public issues and policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Believing that he has been cheated, Joe reclaims his payments but is arrested for robbery. Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. Desperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears. Some time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life.

The following article contains an answer for the question: With which superhero does Grayson appear to have a negative history? , can you please find it? While no cohesive plot is apparent from the vignette style of the trailer, it can be pieced together that Batman has been murdered, and his killer remains at large. Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including Wonder Woman and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene.

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior.

Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol.

Dear Theresa, When we met in Glasgow on Monday, I wished you well for the negotiations that lie ahead now that you have formally invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. I want to reiterate those good wishes now. I very much hope that you succeed in realising your ambitions for the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. A good deal for the UK is clearly in Scotland's interests whatever constitutional future we choose. It is for that reason that I intend that the Scottish government will play a full and constructive role in securing such an outcome. I expressed my frustration on Monday that the process leading up to the invoking of Article 50 had failed to involve the devolved administrations in any meaningful way - a view that I know is shared by the First Minister of Wales. Far from securing a UK-wide approach ahead of invoking Article 50 - as you committed to do last July - the voices of the devolved administrations were largely ignored and all attempts at compromise rejected, in most cases with no prior consultation. As we move forward into a new phase, we need to agree a more direct role and influence for the devolved administrations, reflecting the key interests that are at stake for all of us. However, whatever outcome is secured, it seems inevitable that it will remove the UK, not just from the EU, but also from the single market. As you are aware, that is not an outcome that the people of Scotland voted for. It is also an outcome that will have significant implications for our economy, society and place in the world. In these very changed circumstances, the people of Scotland must have the right to choose our own future - in short, to exercise our right of self determination. Indeed I noted the importance you attached to the principle of self determination in your letter to President Tusk. As you are aware, the Scottish Parliament has now determined by a clear majority that there should be an independence referendum. The purpose of such a referendum is to give people in Scotland the choice of following the UK out of the EU and single market on the terms you negotiate, or becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and build a genuine partnership of equals with the other nations of the UK. A copy of the motion passed by Parliament on 28 March 2017 is attached. The decision of the Scottish Parliament has been made in line with the tradition of popular sovereignty in Scotland - that the people of Scotland should be able to determine the form of government most suited to their needs - and with the clear commitment in the manifesto on which my government was re-elected last May. I am therefore writing to begin early discussions between our governments to agree an Order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 that would enable a referendum to be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament. I have, of course, noted and carefully considered your public position. However, it seems that we are in agreement on the essential matters. For example we agree that now is not the time for a referendum. You confirmed to me on Monday, and repeated in your letter invoking Article 50, that you intend the terms of both the UK's exit from the EU and of a future trade deal to be agreed before March 2019 and in time for ratification by other member states - in other words, between the autumn of next year and the spring of 2019. As you are aware, this is the timescale endorsed by the Scottish Parliament for a referendum. As I have said previously, if the timetable you have set out changes, we will require to consider the implications for the timing of a referendum. However, it seems reasonable at this stage to work on the basis of your stated timetable. We are also in agreement that - unlike the EU referendum - the choice must be an informed one. That means that both the terms of Brexit and the implications and opportunities of independence must be clear in advance of the referendum. It is also worth noting that the clear precedent of the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement should make reaching agreement on this occasion a relatively straightforward process - addressing any concern you may have that discussions would be time-consuming for your government when they are also preparing for EU negotiations. In light of the above, there appears to be no rational reason for you to stand in the way of the will of the Scottish Parliament and I hope you will not do so. However, in anticipation of your refusal to enter into discussions at this stage, it is important for me to be clear about my position. It is my firm view that the mandate of the Scottish Parliament must be respected and progressed. The question is not if, but how. I hope that will be by constructive discussion between our governments. However, if that is not yet possible, I will set out to the Scottish Parliament the steps I intend to take to ensure that progress is made towards a referendum. Again, I wish you well for all that lies ahead and stand ready to discuss both a section 30 order and the Scottish government's role in securing the best outcome for all parts of the UK. I am copying this letter to the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and to Bruce Crawford, convener of the Parliament's Finance and Constitution Committee.

Question: Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat is sick happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If a bat is sick, it can potentially affect its echolocation abilities, especially if the sickness weakens the bat. This can happen through several direct or indirect effects: 1. Reduced energy levels, strength, or stamina: When a bat is sick, its energy levels may decline, leading to weaker echolocation calls. Since high-pitched tones require energy to produce, a weak bat might not be able to generate as loud or clear a sound, which may reduce the effectiveness of its echolocation. 2. Impaired hearing: If the sickness affects the bat's hearing capacity, it might have trouble detecting the returning sound waves or interpreting the information they convey. This would impact the bat's ability to navigate and hunt using echolocation. 3. Neurological effects: A sick bat might have impaired brain function due to fever, inflammation, or infection. These issues can affect the bat's ability to process the returned sound waves and determine the size, shape, and position of objects in its environment. 4. Physical malformations: If the bat's sickness results in changes to its ear shape or other body parts involved in echolocation, like its larynx or mouth, this could lead to weaker or distorted echolocation signals. These altered signals may provide less accurate information to the bat about its surroundings. 5. Distraction or disorientation: A sick bat may be more focused on recovery and addressing its illness than on echolocation. Additionally, if the sickness causes disorientation or imbalance, the bat might find it harder to process and interpret echolocation data, leading to decreased accuracy and effectiveness. Overall, if a bat is sick and experiences weaker echolocation due to perturbations related to its illness, it may struggle to navigate, find food, or avoid obstacles, potentially making it more vulnerable to predation or environmental hazards. The extent to which the perturbation affects echolocation will depend on the severity and nature of the illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How will the increase most likely affect the lake? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the factors contributing to the increase in fish population The sudden increase of fish in the lake could be caused by a variety of reasons, such as the introduction of non-native fish species, increased breeding, reduced predation, or favorable environmental factors. Step 2: Assess the impact on the food chain An increase in fish population will have a significant impact on the food chain within the lake ecosystem. The fish will have more competition for existing food resources, such as plankton and smaller aquatic organisms. This may lead to a decline in the populations of these organisms if the increased fish consumption outpaces their reproduction rate. Step 3: Analyze the effect on water quality An increase in fish population could also affect water quality. Higher fish density may result in more fish waste, which could lead to increased nutrient levels in the water, like ammonia and phosphorus. Excess nutrients can result in eutrophication or harmful algal blooms, which can negatively affect overall water quality and oxygen levels. Step 4: Consider the impact on predator populations Predator populations, such as birds and larger fish, may experience changes in response to the increased fish numbers. Initially, predators may benefit from the increase in prey availability, leading to growth in their populations. However, if the prey population becomes too large and depletes resources, it might affect the predators negatively in the long run. Step 5: Assess the overall impact on the lake ecosystem Taking into consideration the impact on the food chain, water quality, and predator populations, the most likely overall effect of a sudden increase in fish population would be a destabilization of the lake ecosystem. The imbalance in species interactions and the potential decline in water quality could lead to long-term negative consequences for the health of the lake and its inhabitants. In conclusion, the sudden increase in the number of fish in a lake will most likely affect the lake ecosystem through changes in food chain dynamics, water quality, and predator populations, potentially leading to long-term instability and negative impacts on the health of the lake and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Dunn killed Jordan Davis. That's not in dispute, but according to attorneys' opening statements Thursday in Dunn's murder trial, almost everything else is. Assistant State Attorney John Guy, speaking for the prosecution, painted a picture of four innocent teens who stopped at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station for gum and cigarettes amid a day of \\"mall hopping and girl shopping\\" over Thanksgiving break in 2012. Dunn asked the teens to turn down their music, and Jordan disrespected him, saying \\"F*** that n****r\\" -- nothing more -- and for that, Dunn opened fire, hitting Jordan three times. It was a markedly different account from that of defense attorney Cory Strolla, who told jurors that the music was so loud, it was rattling the windows of the teens' SUV, and when Dunn politely asked one of them to turn it down, Jordan uttered the three-word explicit phrase, demanded his pal turn the music back up and began jawing with Dunn. Strolla added that it wasn't Dunn who ordered pizza, but","completion":"rather his fiancée, Rhonda Rouer, who called from the hotel room they retreated to after the shooting.

Strolla insisted that Dunn only fired his gun because he feared for his life and believed he had to protect not only himself but also his fiancée, who was in the car with him. In the courtroom, emotions ran high as witness accounts and evidence were presented. Both the prosecution and defense tried to build their cases, focusing on the actions and intentions of Michael Dunn on that fateful day.

Bunsen Burner - John Otway. I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor. It's Raining Men - Weather Girls. Hot Stuff - Donna Summer. After the warm-up acts, Me Penfold and the rest of Hidden Agenda went out onto stage to perform in front of the 2,000 spectators. Miffy Scally and Alana Warner were the singers, Angela Neil was on sax, Patrick Moore on guitar, Rob Hodgkinson on keyboards, Colin Bibby on drums and Ian on bass. They opened up with ‘Rock That’, by Earth, Wind and Fire and played classics like ‘Car Wash’ by Rose Royce and ‘Superstition’ by Stevie Wonder. The gig finished with a standing ovation as the group thrashed out ‘Hot Stuff’ by Donna Summer. He added: 'It was very enjoyable and more relaxing than expected. It all came along and there were more than 2,000 people watch. 'Seeing my name in lights outside was really special. Strangely, when it got to the performance I was really relaxed about it. 'There was a huge build-up but it ended up going really well. Everyone was up on their feet dancing. 'The. biggest thing was the organisation, going out there and performing felt. like the easy thing. I went out on stage and the crowd sang Happy. Birthday and then I played.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Genetic and environmental variation are both known to influence development. Evolution of a developmental response that is optimized to the environment (adaptive plasticity) requires the existence of genetic variation for that developmental response. In complex traits composed of integrated sets of subsidiary traits, the adaptive process may be slowed by the existence of multiple possible integrated responses. This study tests for family (sibship) specific differences in plastic response to hypoxia in an integrated set of cardiovascular traits in zebrafish.', 'Cardiac output, which is the integrated product of several subsidiary traits, varied highly significantly between families, and families differed significantly in the degree and direction of response to developmental oxygen level. The cardiac output response to oxygen environment was entirely family specific with no significant overall trend due to oxygen level. Constituent physiological variables that contribute to cardiac output all showed significant family specific response to hypoxia. Traits that were not directly related to cardiac output, such as arterial and venous diameter, and red blood cell velocities did not respond to hypoxia in a family specific manner.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf. I told him that I appreciated the call, but he wasn’t the one who needed to apologize.

Answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Input: Passage: Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings.\\" Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, \\"to this day I regret having done it. I don't think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have.\\".

The Union Chain Bridge - built in 1820 - crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in Berwickshire to Horncliffe in Northumberland. It has been on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register since 2013. Investigation work starts on 26 June for up to four weeks meaning it will be shut to vehicles from 3 July on weekdays for a fortnight. When it was officially opened nearly 200 years ago, the structure was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world. However, it has become structurally unsafe and can now only be accessed by one light vehicle at a time. Northumberland County Council (NCC), Scottish Borders Council (SBC) and the Friends of Union Chain Bridge are working together on the project to safeguard the future of the bridge near Berwick-upon-Tweed. It requires urgent conservation and engineering repairs to secure its future. A funding bid for the restoration is now being prepared for the Heritage Lottery Fund, with a maximum of £5m available towards the bulk of the work. The county council's cabinet will meet next month to consider recommendations to contribute funding over three years towards the scheme, which it is hoped can be completed by 2020 - the 200th anniversary of the bridge's opening. Other stakeholders are also expected to make \\"significant contributions\\". The investigation work hopes to provide a greater understanding of the status and condition of the bridge - allowing a \\"more robust bid\\" to be submitted to the HLF. Diversions will be in place for traffic on weekdays while the bridge will be open to pedestrians and cyclists at all times and to vehicles at weekends. Glen Sanderson, cabinet member for environment and local services at NCC, said: \\"The Union Chain Bridge is of international significance but its condition has been of growing concern for a number of years. \\"Along with our colleagues in Scotland we are committed to safeguarding its future and status, both as a key transport link and as a contributor to the local tourism economy. \\"The site investigation work is vital ahead of any major project starting and engineers will be working to keep disruption to a minimum throughout.\\" His counterpart with SBC, Gordon Edgar, also welcomed the move forward. He said: \\"I am pleased we are seeing progress in the bid to retain the Union Chain Bridge as the world's oldest single span suspension bridge still used by traffic. \\"The iconic crossing has provided a vital link between Scotland and England for almost 200 years, and we want that to remain the case. \\"The short-term closure of the bridge to vehicles will cause some inconvenience but will provide important information for its long-term future.\\" Robbie Hunter, who chairs the Friends of the Union Chain Bridge, said it was pleased with the \\"significant financial support\\" of both councils. He said they would continue to \\"lobby hard\\" for HLF funding. \\"It would be an unforgivable tragedy if we failed to save this engineering icon,\\" he said.

After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep. Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep. Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus and runs off. Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory.

Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love.

What is the answer for the question: Who is placed in the car of the person that is in a relationship with a protester? from the following article ? Five men, criminals Ray, Dave, Stevie, Julian (\\"Julie\\" as a nickname), and Jason, plan a heist to steal a minimum of £2 million. Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £68,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \\"expenses\\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray's car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray's girlfriend Connie, a protester. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping. The next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill's home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound. The four are alerted to a pair of undercover police officers and flee, Dave and Julian engaging in a shootout with the police. Believing that he may be arrested for murder, Ray decides to flee after the money is found, and goes to his mother and Connie for help. His mother gives him some money and her car to use, disappointed in her son's career but still caring for him. Ray then speaks with Connie and asks her to come with him, and to meet her at a roadside service station on the M1 if she decides to come.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Question: \\"Why is there a perception that Californians are more health conscious?\\" Answer: \\"Californians rank 10th for physical activity and progressive legislation that aids in obesity prevention and public health promotion\\" Is this answer correct? Choices: (1). no. (2). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"(2). yes. The answer is correct because it highlights the fact that Californians tend to have healthier habits compared to other states in the US, including ranking 10th for physical activity and having progressive legislation that supports and promotes public health initiatives. Additionally, the state has been the first to pass major public health initiatives, such as anti-tobacco campaigns and bike helmet laws, which further contributes to the perception that Californians are more health-conscious. Moreover, the state's overall health-conscious attitude and focus on well-being and adopting healthy lifestyles support the perception that Californians are more health-conscious than people in other states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital. Seemingly minutes after they leave, gunshots are heard outside and the lights... My question: Why do they race back to the house? Answer:","completion":"They race back to the house for several reasons: 1. Safety: After witnessing the alien's abilities and aggressive actions, such as the use of a ray-gun on a cow and burning Brian's hand, the brothers understand the potential danger they and their family are in. Going back to the house provides a familiar environment where they can regroup, gather their family, and plan their next move. They instinctively feel that the house offers better protection than being out in the open with the alien threat looming. 2. Convincing the family: The brothers know that their family is skeptical about their claims of alien encounters. Racing back to the house allows them to show their agitated and fearful state, reinforcing the urgency of the situation. They need to convince their family to flee, and being physically present gives them a better chance to persuade them. 3. Sharing evidence: Tommy has captured the alien encounter on tape, which serves as concrete evidence to back up their story. By racing back to the house, they can play the footage for their incredulous family, removing any doubt about the authenticity of their claims. This would encourage the family to take the threat seriously and act accordingly. 4. Protecting the family: As the situation escalates, the brothers are concerned for the safety of their family members, especially since the aliens are now aware of their presence. By returning to the house, they can be close to their loved ones and try to defend them from any possible harm. 5. Group decision-making: Being together as a family allows for collective discussion and decision-making in the face of the unknown threat. By racing back to the house, the brothers aim to keep everyone informed and involved in determining the best course of action for their survival. In summary, the decision to race back to the house stems from the brothers' instinct to protect their family, share their experience and evidence with them, and to strategize together on their best chance of escaping the alien threat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first question, \\"What are the jobs Quora has eliminated?\\", is asking specifically about the jobs that have been eliminated by Quora, the question and answer website company. This question is focused on a specific company and its impact on the labor market. To answer this question, one would need to research and discuss any instances where Quora has implemented technology or strategies that led to the elimination of certain positions within the company or any direct consequences its platform has had on people's employment. The scope of this question is limited to Quora alone, and doesn't widely ask about the effect of automation on the job market in general. The second question, \\"We've seen how automation has eliminated jobs in certain markets. What effect will AI have on the job market and other ways of life in the future?\\", is a broader enquiry that explores the larger ramifications of artificial intelligence and automation technology on the overall job market and other aspects of human life. While the question acknowledges that automation has already eliminated jobs in some markets, it seeks insights into future implications that AI may bring, both in terms of employment opportunities and daily life. To address this question, one could discuss several possible effects of AI on job market, which may include: 1. Job displacement: The automation of routine tasks may lead to the reduction or elimination of certain job positions, especially those that require low-skilled labor. This can result in people losing their jobs or needing to acquire new skills to adapt to the changing job market. 2. Job creation: AI may generate new jobs that didn't previously exist, such as AI specialists, data analysts, and robotics engineers. These new roles will require expertise in AI technology and its various applications, which could boost job opportunities for skilled individuals. 3. Changing nature of work: As artificial intelligence continues to develop, it may facilitate a transformation in the nature of work itself. Jobs may become more focused on creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills, which are not easily replicated by AI. 4. Societal impact: Adoption of AI could lead to improved efficiency and productivity in various industries, potentially leading to economic growth and improved standard of living. However, it may also exacerbate income inequality, as the benefits of AI technology might not be equally distributed among the population. In conclusion, while the two questions revolve around the theme of job elimination and automation technology, they approach it from different perspectives. The first relates to the specific impact of Quora on job elimination, while the second delves into the broader implications of AI on the job market and other aspects of life in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - There is a rain cloud in the sky - Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other - The collisions create electrical charge - Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud - Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described above is the creation and discharge of lightning due to the separation of charges within a storm cloud. Here is a more detailed and long explanation of the process leading up to lightning formation: 1. There is a rain cloud in the sky: Storm clouds, also known as cumulonimbus clouds, form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing water vapor in the air to condense into visible water droplets or ice particles. 2. Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other: As the cloud continues to grow taller, ice particles within the cloud collide with each other due to turbulent air currents. 3. The collisions create electrical charge: When ice particles collide in the cloud, a charge separation occurs. The lighter, positively charged particles transfer protons (positive charge) to the heavier, negatively charged particles during these collisions. 4. Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud: The positively charged particles, sometimes called \\"graupel,\\" are lighter and get carried to the lower parts of the cloud by updrafts. 5. Heavier, negatively charged particles rise to the top: The larger, negatively charged ice crystals and particles are heavier and tend to be concentrated towards the upper part of the cloud. Now we arrive at the final step of the process: 6. Formation and discharge of lightning: The separation of charges within the cloud creates a strong electric field. The positive charges at the bottom of the cloud induce negative charges on the ground beneath it. When the electric field becomes strong enough, it overcomes the insulating properties of the air, causing a rapid discharge of electricity known as lightning. Lightning can occur within the cloud, between two different clouds, or between the cloud and the ground. It seeks to equalize the charge difference between the cloud and the ground or between separate clouds. The sudden release of electrical energy produces a bright flash of light and generates a tremendous amount of heat, causing the surrounding air to expand explosively. This expansion creates a shock wave, which we perceive as thunder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Teď to vzdát nesmíte.

Pervez Musharraf misses court date for treason trial Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf failed to appear at a treason trial his lawyers have described as biased and illegitimate, after explosives were found near his house on the outskirts of Islamabad. Musharraf had been asked to attend the hearing on Wednesday at the grand national library building in the heart of the capital, where if he is found guilty of treason could see the 70-year-old former general sentenced to death. But his lawyers said he was unable to attend after police found an explosive device along the route Musharraf would have taken to the historic hearing – the first time a former chief of Pakistan's powerful army has ever been put on trial. It was the third time that small bombs have been found near the luxurious residence of the former general, who the Pakistani Taliban have repeatedly vowed to kill. Musharraf failed to turn up to the first hearing of three-judge special court on 24 December when a bomb and weapons were discovered along the road. Tayyab Mahmood Jafri, part of the large team of prosecution lawyers, heaped scorn on yet another discovery of explosives. \\"How could a bomb be put there when the entire route is patrolled? The whole thing is just completely managed so they can play delaying tactics and avoid coming to the court,\\" he said during a break during proceedings at a complex in the country's administrative centre. \\"The brave soldier is afraid of three unarmed judges.\\" Police and commandos surrounded the national library, where the case is being heard in a chilly auditorium. Despite major security precautions the police told judge Faisal Arab they could only provide protection \\"within the available resources\\", which did not include a bombproof vehicle to convey the former president. The defence team warned that the entire building was at risk of being bombed. Anwar Mansoor Khan, a lead defence lawyer, told the court that his car was rammed shortly after the last hearing by an unidentified four-wheel drive vehicle. But the judge appeared unimpressed by the arguments over security fears, noting that courts continue to operate during times of war. And he indicated that he could order the arrest of Musharraf, forcing him to attend the court under armed guard. He said he had not yet taken that step to avoid any embarrassment to a former president and army chief. Musharraf's lawyers argued the case against their client flouted the constitution, was being heard by judges who could not be considered neutral and had been triggered by prime minister Nawaz Sharif's quest for \\"vengeance\\". Although Musharraf toppled Sharif from power in 1999 when he seized power in a coup d'état, the treason trial only relates to his activities in late 2007 when he introduced a period of emergency rule and suspended senior judges. The case is the most serious of the legal difficulties that have beset the former general since his return to Pakistan last March, when he was put under house arrest for various cases, including his alleged involvement in the death of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. He has since been bailed on all the private prosecutions, which most legal experts say he can expect to win. However, the government-initiated treason trial is considered to be a far trickier legal battle. Musharraf has claimed he still has significant support from the army, and many analysts still believe a way will be found to spare his life and send him back into exile abroad.

News article: Teacher Isabelle Graham pictured hand-in-hand with her husband Andrew Wilkie days after being struck off for romping with teen pupil at school prom DISGRACED former teacher Isabelle Graham has been pictured walking hand in hand with her husband – just days after being struck off for bedding a 17-year-old lad in a hotel on his prom night. Graham – who was engaged at the time of the incident — denied the allegations and partner Andrew stood by her. But the General Teaching Council for Scotland barred her from the job following a probe. Their panel found she had “repeatedly engaged in sexual activity” with the boy after giving him booze and sharing a bed with him. Graham — mum to a baby boy — had argued that her drink had been spiked and she couldn’t remember what had happened. She described herself as a “victim”, and referring to the photo said: “The person in the bed is clearly not in control of the situation.” Pictures of the couple have now emerged showing them putting on a united front and holding hands as they emerged from their Hampshire home. The disgraced former Miss has since started a new life — helping to spread religion among squaddies. She resigned from her job as a French teacher at Whitburn Academy, West Lothian, after the shocking allegations emerged and has since set up home down south in Aldershot, Hants. And the devout Christian — who gave birth to her first child last week — now goes by her middle and married names Shona Wilkie. Shamed Graham and her husband, both 28, are working together for the Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Scripture Readers Association (SASRA), based near military barracks. She is in the ‘donor relations’ department of the organisation — which describes itself as introducing squaddies to Jesus — while Andrew is a support officer. Last night a source said: “Maybe this is her way of repenting for her guilt. “SASRA brings Jesus to squaddies and she’s part of the head office staff. “She’s using her middle and married name to get away from her past but a few folk know. “She’s very recently had a baby too so she must be all over the place.” Graham romped with the teenager at a Travelodge in Edinburgh following his prom at the city’s Carlton Highland hotel. A probe was launched after a photograph emerged on social media showing the lad holding what appears to be a bottle of bubbly at the door of a hotel room while a blonde woman sleeps in the bed. The image was captioned by one student with the words: “Poor show from Miss Graham. “I had higher respect for my teacher than this! Disgusting.” A lawyer for the General Teaching Council for Scotland dismissed her drink spiking claim as “speculation”. She was judged unfit to teach and barred from the profession. Carla Roth, presenting the case for the GTCS, told the panel there was a “public nature” to Graham’s actions on the night in June 2014 since they happened around pupils and the photo was shared on social media. She said the incident had left pupils “uncomfortable” and “somewhat shocked” and added: “You would have to question what sort of role model was provided in this instance.” Turning to the teacher’s claim that her drink had been spiked, Ms Roth described it as “essentially no more than a speculation”. She added: “We simply have no evidence of exactly why she may have had a memory loss.” Mrs Roth said Graham was “only willing to consider one version of events”, that her drink had been spiked, rather than that she had drunk too much. The lawyer added: “She cannot be said to have shown any insight into her conduct.” A police investigation was also launched after the photo emerged but the case was not brought to court because of a lack of evidence. Detective Sergeant Keith Mailer, who was part of the probe, described CCTV which showed Graham and the student kissing. He said: “Throughout the footage there’s no sign that Mrs Graham is under the excessive influence of drugs or alcohol.” He added: “The way she moved and conducted herself suggested someone who was making conscious decisions.” The SASRA is a highly respected organisation which has the Queen as its patron and former Army chief General Lord Dannatt as president. Its website says: “Our mission is one of personal evangelism. “Uniquely we are permitted, subject to Chaplain’s permission and Commanding Officers’ permission, to visit soldiers and airmen in their accommodation work and recreation areas. “This is done with a view to befriending them and introducing them to the Lord Jesus Christ.” A West Lothian Council spokesperson said: “Ms Graham is no longer employed by West Lothian Council and it would not be appropriate to comment further.” SHAMED Isabelle is the latest professional to throw away her career by bedding a pupil. Aberdeen-born maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, was jailed for 5½years in 2013 after fleeing to France with his 15-year-old schoolgirl lover. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, who taught English at St Joseph’s College, Dumfries, romped with pupil Matthew Robinson, 17, losing her marriage and career. And mum-of-three Bernadette Smith, 36, a history teacher at Stirling’s Bannockburn High, was struck off for stripping down to her bra and jeans and kissing a boy of 16 on his bed. Educational psychologist Dr Jack Boyle tells ANNA GAULT why teachers and pupils move their relationship out of the class and into bedroom. BOOZE and spur-of-the-moment recklessness can see a teacher risk everything to romp with a pupil, according to Dr Boyle. He said: “The vast majority of teachers are not the slightest bit interested in their pupils sexually. “In this day and age, the risks and penalties for acting on this are enormous — particularly for a teacher as people expect more and they are held to a high standard. “It’s very rare and there is no common thread to a relationship forming. “But sometimes alcohol is involved and of course alcohol will lower inhibitions — it devastatingly impairs judgments. “There is a high degree of impulsivity and recklessness on the part of the teacher. The consequences will ruin their life but because they are often acting on impulse they don’t think that far ahead. “By and large a teacher will indulge in this behaviour because they think they will get away with it.” PUPILS risk ridicule for getting in- olved with a teacher, Dr Boyle said. He went on: “Typically a 17-year-old boy would regard a 27-year-old woman as an older lady and would not be attracted to her. “Children are very conscious of age differences — for instance, a 14-year-old would not play with a 12-year-old. A boy getting involved with an older teacher would be mocked by his friends but, again, alcohol can be a factor. “Adolescent girls can often have a crush on one of their teachers but only a very small number moves into intimacy — and, of course, the teacher has to welcome it.” Dr Boyle said social media opened up more opportunities for teachers and their pupils to chat outside the classroom. He added: “A pupil is taking a risk to have a relationship with a teacher and immaturity is a factor. But they are young and won’t be thinking at an age appropriate level or of how it will affect their future.” We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

The passage describes how the teacher finds it important to integrate technology into their classroom and mentions their past experience of not being able to use computers to support their learning during class. This suggests that the teacher will likely incorporate technology into their lectures to improve the learning experience for their students. The other options do not directly address the integration of technology into the classroom. Allowing students to text in class could be seen as a distraction rather than a useful integration of technology.

Solve 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the r terms The first step is to simplify the equation by combining the r terms. To do this, we add the coefficients of both r terms. (-54*r) + (43*r) = -54r + 43r = -11r Now, our equation is: 0 = -11r + 33 Step 2: Isolate the r term Next, we want to isolate r by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 33 = -11r + 33 - 33 This simplifies to: -33 = -11r Step 3: Solve for r Now, we want to solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -11. -33 / -11 = (-11r) / -11 This simplifies to: 3 = r So, the solution to the equation 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 is r = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years. Paragraph: The Jones family had a history of chronic viral infections. Jenny got human papillomavirus, while her brother Josh got infected with the Epstein–Barr virus. They were both under treatment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sibling had a higher risk of developing skin cancer? Answer:","completion":"Jenny, who got infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), had a higher risk of developing skin cancer compared to her brother Josh, who got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of various cancers, including skin cancer. HPV can cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common skin cancer types. In addition, HPV is known to cause cancers of the cervix, anus, and penis, highlighting its significant role in carcinogenesis. On the other hand, Josh got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, which is primarily associated with lymphomas (such as Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma), B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. While EBV has a significant role in the development of these cancers, it is not a primary cause of skin cancer. As a result, based on the viral infections the siblings acquired, Jenny had a higher risk of developing skin cancer than her brother Josh. However, it's essential to note that risk factors are multifaceted and can be influenced by various genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The presence of these infections may increase the risk of cancer, but an individual's unique circumstances will ultimately determine their overall risk level."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it.

So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer.

In baseball, to tag up is for a baserunner to retouch or remain on their starting base (the time-of-pitch base) until (after) the ball either lands in fair territory or is first touched by a fielder. By rule, baserunners must tag up when a fly ball is caught in flight by a fielder. After a legal tag up, runners are free to attempt to advance, even if the ball was caught in foul territory. On long fly ball outs, runners can often gain a base; when a runner scores by these means, this is called a sacrifice fly. On short fly balls, runners seldom attempt to advance after tagging up, due to the high risk of being thrown out. can you tag up on an infield fly?","completion":"In an infield fly situation, the infield fly rule is applied. The infield fly rule states that if there are less than two outs, and there are runners on first and second base (or bases loaded), and the batter hits a fly ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, the batter is automatically out (regardless of whether the ball is caught or not). This rule is in place to prevent easy double or triple plays. As for tagging up in an infield fly situation, here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. Infield fly rule is called: When the umpire calls an infield fly, the batter is automatically out. At this point, the runners on base should be aware of the situation. 2. The ball is in play: Even though the batter is out, the ball is still considered in play until it is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground. 3. Runners can tag up: Since the ball is in play, the baserunners can tag up just as they would in any other fly ball situation. Once the ball is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground, they must retouch or remain on their starting base. 4. Advancing is risky: Although runners can technically tag up on an infield fly, it is usually not a good idea to try to advance. Infield fly balls are typically easy for fielders to catch, and the baserunners would be susceptible to being thrown out if they attempt to advance. In conclusion, while baserunners can tag up on an infield fly, it is generally not recommended due to the high risk of being thrown out at the next base. Instead, baserunners should focus on safely returning to their original base after tagging up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

Title: The Craft Movie plot: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\". To do so, she plans to \\"call the corners\\" by creating a fire on a beach, so that all four natural elements (earth, fire, air, and water) can be called upon by the four separate girls, to grant them further supernatural abilities. On completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning, and all four girls fall unconscious. Afterward Nancy is... The answer is:","completion":"natural witch"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927? ? After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\\" said George Washington University Law...

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Also at Vitagraph was a young actor, Harry Solter, who was looking for \\"a young, beautiful equestrian girl\\" to star in a film to be produced by the Biograph Studios under the direction of D.W. Griffith. Griffith, the most prominent producer-director at Biograph Studios, had noticed the beautiful blonde-haired woman in one of Vitagraph's films. Because the film's actors received no mention, Griffith had to make discreet inquiries to learn she was Florence Lawrence and to arrange a meeting. Griffith had intended to give the part to Biograph's leading lady, Florence Turner, but Lawrence managed to convince Solter and Griffith that she was the best suited for the starring role in The Girl and the Outlaw. With the Vitagraph Company, she had been earning 20 a week, working also as a costume seamstress over and above acting. Griffith offered her a job, acting only, for 25 a week. After her success in this role, she appeared as a society belle in Betrayed by a Handprint and as an Indian in The Red Girl. In total, she had parts in most of the 60 films directed by Griffith in 1908. Toward the end of 1908 Lawrence married Harry Solter. Lawrence gained much popularity, but because her name was never publicized, fans began writing the studio asking for it. Even after she had gained wide recognition, particularly after starring in the highly successful Resurrection, Biograph Studios refused to publicly announce her name and fans simply called her \\"The Biograph Girl\\". During cinema's formative years, silent screen actors were not named, because studio owners feared that fame might lead to demands for higher wages. She continued to work for Biograph in 1909. Her demand to be paid by the week rather than daily was met, and she received double the normal rate. She achieved great popularity in the \\"Jones\\" series, filmdom's first comedy series, in which she played Mrs. Jones in around a dozen films. More popular still were the dramatic love stories in which she co-starred with John R. Cumpson, as Mr. Jones, and Arthur Johnson. The two played husband and wife in The Ingrate, and the adulterous lovers in Resurrection. Lawrence and Solter began to look elsewhere for work, writing to the Essanay Company to offer their services as leading lady and director. Rather than accepting this offer, however, Essanay reported the offer to Biograph's head office, and they were promptly fired. Is there anything else I should know about Florence Lawrence during this time?","completion":"During this time, Florence Lawrence and her husband, Harry Solter, decided to join Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP) in 1910. Laemmle, the founder of the future Universal Studios, was determined to challenge the monopoly of the Motion Picture Patents Company, which had previously controlled the film industry. Laemmle recognized the potential in Florence Lawrence and devised a clever publicity stunt to promote her, making her the first publicly named movie star. He spread a rumor that \\"The Biograph Girl\\" had been killed in a streetcar accident, and after a few days, he took out an advertisement in various newspapers revealing that she was alive and well, and that she would soon appear in IMP films. As a result, Florence Lawrence became widely known and very popular, enjoying significant stardom in the early days of Hollywood. She starred in more than 50 films for IMP throughout 1910, including director Harry Solter's debut film, Love's Sweet Quarrel. Unfortunately, her fame was short-lived as she suffered a series of personal and career setbacks, ultimately losing her star status by the late 1910s. However, it is important to recognize her contributions to the early film industry, not only as an actress but also as a pioneer who helped pave the way for future movie stars."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What else can explain more than 36,000 people already donating more than 2 million dollars, over the past 2 years, to fund a chance at life for our daughter Eliza and other children. Diagnosed 3 years ago with Sanfilippo Syndrome —a terminal disease sometimes called “Childhood Alzheimer's”— Eliza has now become the first child in the world to have been given this new treatment! The second child has also been treated and in the coming months & through next year, a few handful more children around the world will be part of this groundbreaking gene therapy clinical trial that is already showing promising results. The WORLD decided to rally around our little girl for this greater cause, and she’s become the face of this disease…a symbol for Sanfilippo parents everywhere not to give up HOPE. And we’re not giving up on them either. Many more children are still fighting, and we won’t stop until every last one of them is afforded a chance at life. There are more children that need this treatment than there are available spots in clinical trials, and these precious little ones can’t wait. Given the rapidly degenerative nature of Sanfilippo Syndrome, not receiving a treatment, and soon, is a death sentence. Can you imagine being one of these parents? Since treatment, we see a new light in Eliza’s eyes— she is connecting with us in a way we thought was gone forever. She is working to regain the skills the disease stripped away in the 6 and half years it tore through her body. She is a fighter! Other Sanfilippo children deserve this chance too. At this stage, funding is one of the only things that will accelerate research to give these children a chance. Money doesn’t make the world go round, but it does bring medical treatments faster to children who are dying. Our goal is to reach 4M here to help make this happen. Please donate TODAY to give these beautiful Sanfilippo children a rightful chance at life. Please share so the world can hear their collective voices.

While Americans debate whether a handful of Ebola cases here should lead to stricter quarantine rules , a family in Columbia, South Carolina, have been living in self-imposed quarantine for nearly five months – all to protect their daughter.Eliza O'Neill, 4, suffers from a rare, ultimately fatal genetic disorder called Sanfilippo syndrome , type A.Since she was diagnosed in 2013, the usually energetic and fearless Eliza has been slowly losing her ability to speak. Over time, doctors tell her family, she will lose the ability to walk, eat and ultimately breathe.Her parents, Glenn, 42, and Cara, 39, are racing to raise 2.5 million they need for a clinical trial that is their only chance to find a possible treatment to save Eliza and help other children who suffer from the disorder.As tough as that mission has been with their end-of-the-year deadline soon approaching , they have made another tough decision: To self-quarantine their family of four so as not to expose Eliza to potential illnesses in her vulnerable state.\\"For Eliza to be a great candidate for the trial we don't want her to come down with any sickness or virus at all,\\" Glenn tells PEOPLE. \\"We have heard stories from families of older kids with Sanfilippo where a sickness at this stage started the downward slide even faster and they never fully recovered.\\"The O'Neills believe that the only way to ensure she doesn't catch anything is for the entire family to avoid contact with the outside world.\\"It's beyond hard, but this is what you do for someone you love,\\" says Glenn, a consultant at Symantec ; the company has allowed him to work from home.Cara had to quit her job as a pediatrician and the couple now try to homeschool Eliza and her big brother, Beckham, 7. They get their groceries delivered to the front door and clean every door handle, countertop and package with antibacterial wipes.They haven't had friends or family over for five months. They are now 150 days into their self-imposed isolation and plan to continue it until the clinical trial's hoped-for start date early next year.\\"Sometimes we drive around in the car, and now I consciously avoid the roads that take us by playgrounds, parks and schools with kids playing outside. It's not just hard for her, it's also torture for me knowing she wants to be out there,\\" Cara writes in a blog post about their experience If they have to stop for gas, only Cara and Glenn will get out of the car.\\"We wear masks and gloves and we don't go inside any stores,\\" says Glenn. \\"I know we look crazy, but we are just trying to save our daughter's life.\\"They don't have the diversion of television because her parents believe Eliza communicates better without it around.\\"With our decision to not go out, we are in essence, taking experiences away from her. We're doing all of this in hopes that we will actually be giving her the best chance at a full future, but it is still very hard to reconcile in our minds,\\" Cara writes. \\"Our lives have become completely 'virtual.' \\"Eliza and Beckham won't see friends on their birthdays that are coming up, they won't trick-or-treat on Halloween, and there will be no visit to Santa at the mall this Christmas.As young as he is, Cara and Glenn have explained the restrictions to Beckham – and he seems to understand. \\"It's not worth it to go out where people are,\\" he writes on the blog. \\"I wouldn't take the risk.\\"At times, Glenn says, the family goes a bit stir crazy being stuck inside. But they never forget why they are doing this.\\"The first few weeks were very hard, but it has become the new normal,\\" Glenn writes. \\"[One hundred and fifty days] is a long time, but we will go to any lengths. We'll do this as long as it takes.\\" ||||| Sanfilippo syndrome is an inherited condition, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait. Sanfilippo syndrome occurs when the substances (enzymes) needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective. There are 4 main types of Sanfilippo syndrome, also called MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected. ||||| Courtesy Glenn O’Neill The O’Neill family in Colombia, S.C., have placed themselves on self-quarantine for the past 160 days to protect sickly little girl Eliza. A South Carolina family has lived the past 160 days under self-quarantine and would know better than anyone the challenges facing Ebola medical workers under mandated quarantines. But Glenn O'Neill told the Daily News his family's situation was much different than the health care professionals returning home from West Africa, because the O'Neills can decide to leave their house whenever they want. Instead, they choose to stay away from other people as a precaution to protect the health of Glenn's 4-year-old daughter, Eliza, who has Sanfilippo syndrome. Children with the extremely rare disease typically start developing deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by age 5. Many of the victims are confined to a wheelchair as the disease starts to spread. Mandated Quarantines States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies madating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines. People placed under the mandates have resisted the protocols and medical experts have decried the regulations as unnecessary — though politicians say they're in the public's best interest.

She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday night, when she was allowed to serve her 21-day quarantine at her home in Maine. The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They do leave their house once every other week, but only to places they are sure there will not be any other people, such as a deserted beach or an open field. And the only time Glenn O'Neill has gone somewhere with people, he might have gotten arrested. He needed to go to a bank to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation. The 42-year-old was as cautious as he could be, informing the bank members ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything. As he pulled into the parking lot, he started to put on his protective mask and gloves — and scared a fellow motorist who spotted him. People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter how can you use that word? \\"He pulled back real slowly and had a look on his face like, 'what the heck?'\\" O'Neill said. \\"He thought I was going to rob the place. I called the bank and said 'I'm coming in with gloves and a mask. Just making sure there won't be any trouble.'\\" Making the Decision In May the children, Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Glenn's wife, Cara, left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Glenn now works from home as a purchasing consultant. \\"People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?\\" he said. Eliza, who turns 5 next month, is at a crucial stage at which simple colds and illnesses could accelerate her deterioration. The measure has worked. Eliza has not gotten sick and is doing as well as could reasonably be expected for the time being, Glenn said. Steven J.

Family's Adjustment The family does not have a TV and spendsa limited amount of time on the computer because Eliza's condition lends to more addictive characteristics. If she is in front of a screen it will affect her speaking ability. Cara said they appreciated the time they could spend with their kids. \\"You don't have that rush of a typical life where you say we have to stop reading right now because we have something to do,\\" she said. \\"We're OK. We do what we can do. Sometimes we get overwhelmed, but it's just life. We have bad moments and good ones.\\" The family doesn't get visitors, but they will Skype their relatives and Eliza's speech therapist.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"The answer provided does not accurately address the question about versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell. Instead, the answer focuses on the integration of graphical interface-based management applications with Windows PowerShell. To accurately answer the question, you should provide information on the versions of Windows that do not include PowerShell by default. Here is a detailed answer: PowerShell was first introduced with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Before these versions, Windows systems used other scripting technologies and command tools, such as CMD.exe and VBScript, to manage various system tasks. The versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell by default include: 1. Windows XP: This version of Windows was released in 2001 and does not come with PowerShell pre-installed. However, you can manually install PowerShell 2.0 on Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3). 2. Windows Server 2003: Another version without PowerShell by default, Windows Server 2003, can also be updated to support PowerShell 2.0 with the installation of Service Pack 2 (SP2) and .NET Framework 2.0. 3. Windows 2000: This server and workstation edition was released in 2000, and it does not have PowerShell, nor can it be updated to support it. 4.

Article: Every four years athletes from the world take part in the Olympic Games. Both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games are held every four years. The Winter Olympic Games are usually held two years before the Summer Olympic Games. The ancient Olympic Games began around the year 776 BC in Greece. Many of the sports were the same as they are now. Some of the games in which the young men competed were: running, jumping, and wrestling. Women were not allowed to take part in the games. After about the year 393 AD the Olympic Games stopped. For centuries there were no Olympic Games. But they were not forgotten. The first Olympic Games in modern times happened in 1896. They were held in Greece--the country in which the Games were born. in the Games there were 311 competitors from 13 countries. After that more and more countries joined in the Games. In 2000, over 10,000 athletes from 227 countries went to Sydney; Australia, for the 27th Olympic Games! There are 300 different events in the Games. Horse riding, hammer throw and shooting are some of the more unusual events. Question: According to the passage, which Olympic Games will be held in 2012. Answer: Choices: I. 27th; II. 28th; III. 29th; IV. 30th; The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first determine the timeline of the Olympic Games. 1. The passage states that the 27th Olympic Games occurred in 2000. 2. Olympic Games happen every four years, so we need to figure out how many Olympic Games took place between 2000 and 2012. Now let's calculate: 1. From 2000 to 2004 is one Olympic Games (28th). 2. From 2004 to 2008 is another Olympic Games (29th). 3. From 2008 to 2012 is yet another Olympic Games (30th). So, according to the passage, the Olympic Games held in 2012 will be the 30th Olympic Games. The answer is: IV. 30th;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare. - Lake Erie is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the thirteenth-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is deep. Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake. - Downtown Cleveland is the central business district of the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, United States. It is the economic and symbolic center of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area. As of 2000, 100,000 people worked in the district; as of 2012, it contained more than 16 million square feet of rentable office space. - The Lettermen is an American male pop vocal trio. The Lettermen's trademark is close-harmony pop songs with light arrangements. The group started in 1959. They have had two Top 10 singles (both #7), 16 Top 10 singles on the Adult Contemporary chart (including one #1), 32 consecutive Billboard Magazine chart albums, 11 gold records, and five Grammy nominations. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\". - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family. - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. - The O'Jays are an American R&B group from Canton , Ohio , formed in 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert ( born June 16 , 1942 ) , Walter Williams ( born August 25 , 1943 ) , William Powell ( January 20 , 1942 -- May 26 , 1977 ) , Bobby Massey and Bill Isles . The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with \`\` Lonely Drifter '' in 1963 , but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff , a team of producers and songwriters , signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972 . With Gamble & Huff , the O'Jays ( now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey ) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with \`\` Back Stabbers '' ( 1972 ) , and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with \`\` Love Train '' . Numerous other hits followed through the 1970s and into the 80s and 90s , and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 , and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 . - Philadelphia soul, sometimes called Philly soul, the Philadelphia sound or Sweet Philly, is a genre of soul music characterized by funk influences and lush instrumental arrangements, often featuring sweeping strings and piercing horns. The subtle sound of a vibraphone can often be heard in the background of Philly soul songs. The genre laid the groundwork for disco and what are now considered quiet storm and smooth jazz by fusing the R&B rhythm sections of the 1960s with the pop vocal tradition, and featuring a slightly more pronounced jazz influence in its melodic structures and arrangements. - Smooth jazz is a popular genre of music that grew out of jazz and is influenced by rhythm and blues, funk, rock and roll, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). Musicians such as Kenny G, Ramsey Lewis, Dave Koz, and Spyro Gyra have had hits with instrumental recordings, while singers such as Anita Baker, Sade, Sting and Norah Jones have found success with vocal releases. George Benson remains a popular Smooth Jazz artist as both a singer and guitar player. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Quiet storm is a radio format and a subgenre of contemporary R&B music that is characterized by understated, mellow dynamics, slow tempos, and relaxed rhythms. It was pioneered in the mid-1970s by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the radio station WHUR-FM in Washington, D.C.. This style of R&B music is named for Smokey Robinson's 1976 single \\"Quiet Storm\\". - Back Stabbers is a studio album by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays, released in August 1972 on Philadelphia International Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1972. - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) was organized to honor outstanding vocal groups throughout the world by Tony Butala, also the founder (and now only surviving original member) of The Lettermen. Headquartered in Sharon, Pennsylvania, United States, it includes a theater and a museum. - North Coast Harbor is a district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on the shore of Lake Erie. The district serves as the home of the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, FirstEnergy Stadium, the Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum, the USS \\"Cod\\", Burke Lakefront Airport, Voinovich Bicentennial Park, and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. It is served by the West 3rd and North Coast stations on RTA's light rail Waterfront Line. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Philadelphia International Records (PIR) is an American record label based in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1971 by the writer-producer duo, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, along with their long time collaborator Thom Bell. It was famous for showcasing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly soul) that was founded on the gospel, doo-wop, and soul music of the time. This Philly Soul sound later became a prominent and distinct era within R&B itself. During the 1970s the label released a string of worldwide hits which emphasized lavish orchestral instrumentation, heavy bass, and driving percussion. - \\"Love Train\\" is a hit single by The O'Jays, written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Released in 1972, it reached number one on both the R&B Singles and the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, in February and March 1973 respectively, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold by the RIAA. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Ahmet Ertegun (Turkish spelling: Ahmet Ertegün; ( December 14, 2006) was a Turkish-American businessman, songwriter and philanthropist. - Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes. What is the relationship between 'the o'jays' and 'rhythm and blues'? Answer:","completion":"The O'Jays are an American R&B (Rhythm and Blues) group that originated from Canton, Ohio. Formed in 1958, they were primarily known for their contributions to the R&B genre, which combined elements of African-American gospel music, jazz, and rhythm and blues. The relationship between The O'Jays and Rhythm and Blues can be seen in their music style, which mainly features soulful melodies, emotive and powerful vocals, and strong rhythmic elements derived from gospel and blues. Their work became synonymous with the often danceable, groovy sounds of R&B, with songs that showcased deeply emotional themes or narrated impactful stories. The O'Jays' partnership with the songwriting and producing duo Gamble & Huff at the Philadelphia International Records transformed their music and took them to greater heights. Their breakthrough came with songs like \\"Back Stabbers\\" (1972) and \\"Love Train\\" (1973), which not only incorporated their R&B roots but also blended elements of Philadelphia soul. This musical fusion helped define their sound for years to come and secured their place as influential artists within the R&B genre. Throughout their career, The O'Jays have been recognized for their significant contributions to R&B by being inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Their enduring impact on rhythm and blues music solidifies their legacy as one of the genre's defining and influential groups."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So how did England's players fare overall? Chief football writer Phil McNulty runs the rule over those on duty. Barely in action. Has had plenty of quiet matches in this Euro 2016 campaign - might have been a night for Jack Butland to get a taste of the action. Had plenty of time to get forward and deliver some crosses but actually had a fairly quiet game. Barely needed defensively. Useful outing for the Southampton defender but very much down the pecking order of England left-backs. Competent. Not much to do but elegant on the ball and one excellent clearance that could easily have been an own goal with poor technique. Solid in defence but once again a night where he was never fully tested by an average Estonia side. Tireless as ever but restricted by his role as a holding midfield player. Hodgson's Mr Reliable. A dazzling, unpredictable talent. Still has flaws in decision-making but a real England game-changer and superb pass for Theo Walcott's goal. Busy without making a serious impact on the game.

But Labour says the plans \\"offer little hope\\" to those already in the sector, \\"promising only jam tomorrow, when what is needed is action today\\". The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England will fund the scheme. Ministers in England have previously acknowledged that the treatment offered to patients with mental health problems suffers in comparison with those with physical ailments. In 2016, the government committed Â£1.3bn to transform mental health services in England, with a pledge to treat an extra one million patients by 2020-21. These plans set out how some of that money will be spent - mostly on recruiting staff, with the main focus being on child and adolescent mental health services, therapists delivering talking therapies for adults and nurses working in crisis care. The plans also include improving staff training, encouraging those who have left the profession to return, and addressing a high dropout rate among trainees. However, data published last week showed that even before this latest recruitment drive, many thousands of nursing posts remain unfilled.

Summarize this article: A Rapa Nui Rock Garden, or agricultural field, with Poike volcano in the background. Credit: Christopher M. Stevenson (Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from the U.S., Chile and New Zealand has uncovered evidence that contradicts the conventional view of the demographic collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team describes how they conducted obsidian hydration dating of artifacts from the island to trace the history of human activity in the area and what they found in doing so. For many years, Earth scientists and others have used Easter Island and its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, as a lesson in what can happen when a parcel of land is overpopulated and thus overused—resources diminish and the people starve to death (or resort to cannibalism as some have suggested). But now, the researchers with this new effort suggest that thinking may be wrong. Scientists believe Polynesians first settled on Easter Island sometime around 1200 AD—over the course of the next several hundred years the settlers became the Rapa Nui, famous for the massive maoi statues that were erected. Over that time period, the people cut down most of the trees on the northern part of the island and a lot of the other vegetation. That led to the loss of nutrient rich topsoil due to erosion and the idea that the people began to starve to death. To better understand what actually occurred both before and after Europeans arrived in the 1700's, the researchers used a technique known as obsidian hydration dating on artifacts found at various sites on the northern part of the island where the Rapa Nui lived. That allowed them to gain insights into how the land in that area had been used during different time periods. From that they were able to construct a timeline that showed where the people were living over the course of hundreds of years. And that, the researchers report, showed that rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns. Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards. The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery. This means, the team concludes, that there is little evidence of population collapse prior to European contact. Explore further: Genomic data support early contact between Easter Island and Americas More information: Variation in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) land use indicates production and population peaks prior to European contact, Christopher M. Stevenson, PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1420712112 Abstract Many researchers believe that prehistoric Rapa Nui society collapsed because of centuries of unchecked population growth within a fragile environment. Recently, the notion of societal collapse has been questioned with the suggestion that extreme societal and demographic change occurred only after European contact in AD 1722. Establishing the veracity of demographic dynamics has been hindered by the lack of empirical evidence and the inability to establish a precise chronological framework. We use chronometric dates from hydrated obsidian artifacts recovered from habitation sites in regional study areas to evaluate regional land-use within Rapa Nui. The analysis suggests region-specific dynamics including precontact land use decline in some near-coastal and upland areas and postcontact increases and subsequent declines in other coastal locations. These temporal land-use patterns correlate with rainfall variation and soil quality, with poorer environmental locations declining earlier. This analysis confirms that the intensity of land use decreased substantially in some areas of the island before European contact. ||||| The downfall of Easter Island may have had more to do with preexisting environmental conditions than degradation by humans, according to a new study of the remote speck of land made famous by its enormous stone-head statues. Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, was first settled around A.D. 1200, and Europeans landed on its shores in 1722. The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the indigenous population of Rapa Nui are hotly debated both in academia and popular culture. Scientist and author Jared Diamond argued in his 2005 book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" (Viking Press) that prior to European contact, the indigenous people of the island degraded the environment to the extent that they could no longer thrive. The new study suggests that Easter Island's people were, indeed, suffering before Europeans came along. The story of their downfall, however, may be less about environmental degradation than the pre-existing environmental constraints of the 63-square-mile (163 square kilometers) isle. [Image Gallery: The Walking Statues of Easter Island] \\"The results of our research were really quite surprising to me,\\" said study co-author Thegn Ladefoged, an anthropologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \\"Indeed, in the past, we've published articles about how there was little evidence for pre-European-contact societal collapse.\\" Collapse of civilization? The new study challenged Ladefoged and his colleagues' view. Changes on Easter Island have been well documented, archaeologically. Over time, elite dwellings were destroyed, inland agricultural fields were abandoned, and people took refuge in caves and began manufacturing more and more spear points made out of volcanic glass called obsidian, perhaps suggesting a period of war and upheaval. The problem with pinning down the island's history, according to the researchers, is that the dates of all these events and abandonments remain murky. Going into the study, the researchers expected to find that most of the disaster occurred after Europeans arrived, Ladefoged told Live Science. To clarify the timeline, the researchers analyzed more than 400 obsidian tools and chipped-off obsidian flakes from six sites scattered around the island, focusing in particular on three with good information on climate and soil chemistry. Obsidian absorbs water when exposed to air. By measuring the amount of water absorption in the surfaces of the obsidian tools and flakes, the research team was able to gauge how long those surfaces have been exposed, thus revealing when the tools were made. A greater number of tools from a certain time period indicates heavier human use of that area during that time. [History's 10 Most Overlooked Mysteries] Natural challenges The obsidian dates varied widely across the sites. Site 1, on the northwestern coast of the island, saw a steady increase in use between about 1220 and 1650, with a fast decline starting after 1650 — long before Europeans arrived on the island. Site 2, an interior mountainside site, saw a rapid increase in land use between about 1200 and 1300, a slower increase until about 1480, and then constant use until a decline that started between 1705 and 1710, also before European contact. By the time Europeans came along, coastal Site 1 was at about 54 percent of its peak land use, and mountainous Site 2 was at only about 60 percent. Site 3 told a different story. This near-coastal area saw a slow increase in human activity between 1250 and 1500, and then a faster increase until about 1690, after which settlement remained fairly constant until after European contact. In fact, the decline in use of this site didn't begin until 1850 or later, the researchers found. The differing climates of the sites may explain the uneven decline, the researchers said. Site 1 is in the rain shadow of the volcano Ma'unga Terevaka, making it prone to droughts. Site 2 is wetter, but its soil fertility is low. Site 3, the longest-lasting spot, is both rainy and fertile. What this means is that the people of Easter Island may have been struggling against natural environmental barriers to success, rather than degrading the environment themselves, the researchers reported Monday (Jan. 5) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"It is clear that people were reacting to regional environmental variation on the island before they were devastated by the introduction of European diseases and other historic processes,\\" Ladefoged said. The next step, he said, would be to take a detailed look at the archaeological remnants of dwellings on the island over time to better understand how humans and the environment interacted.

(Gregory Boissy/AFP/Getty Images) In 1722, Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen was in the middle of a bad career move. The year before, at 62, the successful notary and Dutch East India Company employee had ditched it all to follow his father’s dream of discovering Terra Australis, a mythical continent in the Southern Hemisphere thought to be as large as the vast land masses that crowded the Northern Hemisphere. The problem: Terra Australis didn’t exist. Sure, Australia and Antarctica are down under somewhere, but these measly continents are nowhere near large enough to balance out the great expanses of terra firma north of the Equator, an equilibrium thought necessary by Age of Exploration theorists. So Roggeveen — a bit of a Don Quixote on a fool’s errand — wandered about the seas. He rounded Cape Horn. He battled ice and bad weather up the coast of Chile. Then he turned left into the great, largely empty unknown. And on Easter Sunday, he made his most significant discovery: a land mass of about 60 square miles notable for its giant statues and lack of large trees that he named Easter Island, now called Rapa Nui. He stayed for a week. His crew killed some Rapa Nui locals. And then he split, sailing northwest into obscurity. Not long after this first encounter between the Old World and the New, Easter Island’s population began to decline. Some scholars blamed a dwindling food supply resulting from Rapa Nui residents’ abuse of the environment. Others blamed Europeans. Did the meandering Dutch notary discover a remote civilization later undone by invaders, or was it already on the brink of collapse? A new paper provides evidence that, for the Rapa Nui, depleted resources were not a problem — leaving Europeans as a possible culprit. “Our paper evaluates a long-standing debate and examines whether the prehistoric population of Rapa Nui experienced a significant demographic collapse prior to European contact,” researchers led by Christopher M. Stevenson of Virginia Commonwealth University wrote. “… This analysis demonstrates that the concept of ‘collapse’ is a misleading characterization of prehistoric human population dynamics.” The so-called collapse of Rapa Nui’s food supply, which resulted in starvation and cannibalism, is a long-held theory and, on occasion, a parable for the dangers of abusing the environment. After coming to the island in about 1200 A.D., the story goes, Polynesian settlers stripped it bare of trees, eroding nutrient-rich topsoil. Jared Diamond presented this case in his book “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.” “They had the misfortune to be living in one of the most fragile environments, at the highest risk of deforestation, of any specific people,” he wrote. “… Easter’s isolation makes it the clearest example of a society that destroyed itself by overexploiting its own resources.” Investigating this thesis for the study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers tried to figure out how people on Rapa Nui used their land — and whether they had enough to eat. Their technique: good old obsidian hydration dating, which allowed them to figure out when artifacts discovered in different parts of the island were used. Their conclusion: Yes, food production probably declined on Rapa Nui before Roggeveen’s arrival. But that wasn’t a disaster. “We propose that precontact declines in the intensity of land use (and presumably population) in dry and infertile regions of Rapa Nui better reflect a framework of environmental constraint than of environmental degradation,” they wrote. As Phys.org translated: “Rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns.” There’s no doubt that Rapa Nui was devastated not long after Roggeveen‘s visit. Its population was in the thousands when the Dutchman made landfall in 1722. By the time British navigator Captain James Cook arrived in 1774, it was about 700. The reason for the decline? The new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences did not speculate. But other writers pointed to sexually-transmitted disease — and slavery — brought to Rapa Nui by Europe. “Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards,” Phys.org noted. “The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A team of researchers from the U.S., Chile, and New Zealand has discovered evidence that contradicts the popular view of the collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact. By conducting obsidian hydration dating on artifacts from the island, the researchers gained insight into how the land had been used during various time periods. The results indicate that instead of a population crash caused by starvation, there were population shifts due to changing weather patterns. Some areas experienced population declines before European contact, but these declines are attributed to the impact of the already challenging environmental conditions, rather than solely human degradation of the environment. The Rapa Nui population underwent a dramatic decline after exposure to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and many being taken and sold into slavery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of Pullen's brother-in-law whose work he hoped \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated\\" by both his professional brethren as well as \\"all men of educated taste throughout Europe and America\\"? Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\" Answer:","completion":"The full name of Pullen's brother-in-law, whose work he hoped would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated by both his professional brethren as well as \\"all men of educated taste throughout Europe and America,\\" is William Burges.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: How might someone feel if they were committing perjury? Possible A: embarrassment indictment, tension, going to jail, penalty, mistrial Why is \\"tension\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"Tension is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a natural emotional response when someone is knowingly engaging in a dishonest or illegal act, such as committing perjury. Perjury is the act of intentionally providing false information or lying under oath, usually in a legal setting like a court trial or a deposition. This is a serious offense that can lead to legal consequences, including criminal charges. When someone is consciously lying or providing false information, they are likely aware of the potential consequences of their actions. This awareness can create a sense of tension, as the individual may be nervous, stressed, or anxious about being caught or exposed. This tension may manifest in various physical symptoms such as sweating, increased heart rate, or difficulty maintaining eye contact. Moreover, the individual might experience a feeling of unease and discomfort while lying, making it even more difficult for them to keep calm and composed. In addition to the legal ramifications of committing perjury, the person may also be aware of the moral and ethical implications of their actions. Most people are raised with an understanding that lying and dishonesty are not acceptable behaviors, and knowingly engaging in such activities can lead to feelings of guilt or shame. This emotional turmoil can exacerbate the tension experienced by the individual as they struggle to reconcile their actions with their personal values. The innate human desire to maintain a positive reputation and be viewed as honest and trustworthy also contributes to the tension that one might feel when committing perjury. The fear of being exposed as a liar can damage both personal and professional relationships, leading to potential social isolation and loss of credibility. In summary, the answer \\"tension\\" is aligned with human common sense because it reflects a natural emotional response to performing an act contrary to one's morals and ethical standing, as well as the awareness of potential legal and social consequences that may arise from committing perjury. This tension arises due to the combination of guilt, fear, and stress that can accompany engaging in dishonest and illegal behavior."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The play group was designed not only to introduce Prince George to other children his age but also to give his parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, the opportunity to interact with other parents and their children in a more relaxed setting. It is without a doubt that the presence of the world's media added extra pressure on Prince George and his parents. However, it is essential to remember that, despite his royal status, Prince George is still a young child who is learning and experiencing new things like any other child of his age. By describing him as \\"very intrepid,\\" it reflects that he showed courage and was able to adapt well to his new environment, despite the additional pressures surrounding him. Prince George is growing up in a unique situation, constantly monitored by the public and the media, expected to behave exceptionally well at all times. In this play group, he demonstrated that he could adapt to new situations and be well-behaved in the presence of others. This is a time of learning and growth for not just Prince George, but also his parents, who are relatively new to parenthood as well. The play group allowed them to interact with other parents and form bonds, as well as learning from one another, which is an essential part of the parenting journey. In conclusion, while the presence of the global media is an added challenge for the young royal family, Prince George's behavior at the play group shows that his parents are doing their best to provide him with a normal upbringing and to teach him how to navigate and adapt to his high-profile life. The incident of theft can be seen as a typical childhood exploration, demonstrating that, like any other child his age, Prince George is curious and learning from his surroundings."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family name needed restoring? is inside the article: Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

Question: suppose There is lake nearby happens, how will it affect more chemicals are released. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More Step 1: Understand the concept of acid rain Acid rain is formed when chemicals, specifically sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acids then fall to the ground through rain, snow, fog, or as dry particles. Step 2: Consider the location of the lake In the given scenario, there is a lake nearby the area where acid rain is occurring. Step 3: Analyze the effect of acid rain on the lake When acid rain falls onto the ground, it can wash off into nearby bodies of water, like lakes. This can make the water in the lake more acidic. Step 4: Consider what will happen if more chemicals are released If more chemicals (SO2 and NOx) are released into the atmosphere, this will lead to an increase in the amount of sulfuric acid and nitric acid being formed. Step 5: Analyze the consequences of an increased load of chemicals With more chemicals being released into the atmosphere, the subsequent increase of sulfuric acid and nitric acid will result in more acid rain. As a result, more acidic water will flow into the lake. This will increase the acidity of the lake and could cause harm to the ecosystem.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People do not analyze every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

After its acquisition of satellite television service DirecTV, telephone giant AT&T Inc. might be setting its sights on an even bigger prize, Time Warner Inc. Bloomberg News reported Thursday afternoon that AT&T and Time Warner executives have engaged in preliminary talks about a potential merger or other partnerships. Time Warner shares jumped on news of the talks, closing up 3.75, or 4.7%, to 82.99. The New York media company owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS and Hollywood’s largest film and TV studio, Warner Bros. Representatives of AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. Such a combination would transform AT&T, based in Dallas, into a communications and entertainment colossus with multiple distribution outlets — including one of the nation’s largest mobile phone networks — and some of the most prestigious television channels in the business. Warner Bros. also has a rich library of characters, including DC Comics and such cartoon characters as Scooby-Doo and the Looney Tunes zoo, including Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat. In some ways, AT&T-Time Warner would resemble cable giant Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal — but AT&T would be even bigger with its mobile phone operations. AT&T already operates the nation’s largest pay-TV service with more than 25 million customers. Like other telecommunications companies, AT&T has been eager to expand into the entertainment business as its mobile phone market matures. Owning content has become more valuable as more consumers, especially younger ones, watch entertainment on their phones. AT&T completed its 49-billion acquisition of DirecTV, based in El Segundo, in July 2015. Later this year the company plans to roll out a streaming service of TV channels to compete with traditional TV operators. AT&T has been working with an executive with considerable chops in Hollywood, former News Corp. President Peter Chernin, who now runs his own entertainment company. He and AT&T have partnered on several ventures, including Otter Media, suggesting that Chernin might play a role in the talks with Time Warner. Such a massive merger, however, would probably trigger significant antitrust concerns. It would come during a changing of the guard in Washington and it’s unclear whether regulators within a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration would consent to such a dramatic consolidation. The discussions come two years after Time Warner warded off a hostile takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch and his sons at 21st Century Fox. That deal valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion, but it collapsed amid resistance from Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes and Time Warner’s board. In addition, Fox investors got nervous about the acquisition, sending its shares down. Time Warner is currently valued at 65 billion. AT&T’s market capitalization is 238 billion. Time Warner, in recent years, has accelerated its push into digital media, launching HBO Now nearly 18 months ago. This summer, Time Warner took a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu, which is owned by NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney. AT&T shares closed down 73 cents, or 1.8%, to 38.65 in Thursday trading.

This article was first published at 2:35 p.m. ||||| (Reuters) - Senior executives of telecommunications company AT&T; Inc (T.N) and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc TWX.N have discussed various business strategies including a possible merger in recent weeks, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter. An AT&T; Logo is pictured on the side of a building in Pasadena, California, January 26, 2015. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni A deal would be one of the largest in recent years in the sector as telecom companies make a land grab for media firms in order to get hold of valuable content. Time Warner shares jumped 4.7 percent in regular trading and slightly extended gains after hours. AT&T; shares slipped 1.8 percent. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, Bloomberg said. (bloom.bg/2enqBF9) AT&T; and Time Warner declined to comment. Time Warner is attractive because of its premium cable channel HBO, the CNN news network, film studio Warner Bros and other media assets. AT&T;, which sells wireless phone and broadband services, may be looking to emulate cable company Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), which acquired NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation in a bid to become a massive force that controls how television shows and movies are made and how they are delivered to viewers. Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies more leverage as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or are cutting the cord altogether and watching online. AT&T; has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse, buying satellite TV provider DIRECTV last year for 48.5 billion. Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes has not been willing to sell in the past. The company rejected an 80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014. While Bewkes, 64, was not open to a deal two years ago, the pace of consolidation in the media sector may urge him to reconsider, especially as two competitors, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) have been exploring a potential merger at the request of controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone. Talk of a deal comes as another potential bidder, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is busy with its purchase of internet company Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, which has been set back by news of a massive hacking breach into Yahoo customers’ email accounts. Time Warner has a market value of about 65 billion. AT&T; has a market value of about 238 billion. Any merger of that size in a sensitive market would get a close look from regulators, analysts said, but that would not necessarily derail a deal. “Whoever the next president’s pick for the Federal Communications Commission is will have a significant say,” said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. Entner said Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal set a precedent and there is “a strong argument to say the FCC should approve” a deal between AT&T; and Time Warner. ||||| LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:43 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Senior executives at AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. have met in recent weeks to discuss various business strategies including a possible merger, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks, which at this stage are informal, have focused on building relations between the companies rather than establishing the terms of a specific transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, the people said. Acquiring Time Warner would give AT&T, one of the biggest providers of pay-TV and of wireless and home internet service in the U.S., a collection of popular programming to offer to subscribers, from HBO to NBA basketball to the Cartoon Network. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has been looking to add more content and original programming as part of his plan to transform the Dallas-based telecommunications company into a media and entertainment giant. “There’s a lot that’s attractive about Time Warner,” media industry veteran Peter Chernin, who runs an online video joint venture with AT&T, said in an interview Thursday on CNBC. “I think they’re both great companies.” He said he didn’t know anything about a deal. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes is a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair, said one of the people. Bewkes and his board rejected an 85-a-share approach in 2014 from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc., which valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion. For a Gadfly take on AT&T’s media ambitions, click here Time Warner rose 4.7 percent to 82.99, valuing the company at about 64.5 billion. AT&T fell 1.9 percent to 38.65. Representatives for AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. Telecom Powerhouse Time Warner shares had gained about 23 percent this year through Wednesday, boosted by sales gains at both its HBO premium channel and Turner cable-TV unit. AT&T is up 12 percent in 2016, valuing the Dallas-based company at about 238 billion. AT&T has transformed itself over the last decade from a regional phone company to a national telecommunications powerhouse. Its plan to focus on media and entertainment targets include companies worth 2 billion to 50 billion, people familiar with the plans said earlier this month. Last year, AT&T paid 48.5 billion to acquire satellite-TV provider DirecTV, its biggest deal in at least 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T has been developing an internet-based version of the pay-TV service, called DirecTV Now. “With the pending launch of the DirecTV Now OTT app, it might make sense to move onto content ownership, but Time-Warner is an awfully big first step into the content world,” said John Butler, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in an e-mail. The results are mixed with blockbuster deals that bring outsiders into the media industry. Comcast Corp. has had a largely successful run since acquiring control of NBCUniversal in 2009. But Time Warner itself had one of the most disastrous mergers of all time when it combined with America Online Inc. in 2000. With 7.2 billion of cash on hand, AT&T doesn’t have enough firepower to make a big deal with cash alone. In the wake of the DirecTV purchase and the 18 billion it spent in the federal airwave auction last year, AT&T’s net debt was 120 billion at the end of June. Moody’s Investors Service calculates the company’s adjusted leverage at 3.1 times earnings and says the company’s rating, three levels above junk, could be downgraded if it doesn’t stay on track to fall below 3 times. — With assistance by Lucas Shaw, Gerry Smith, and Scott Moritz ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Telecoms company, AT&T Inc and media conglomerate, Time Warner, have reportedly been engaging in preliminary discussions regarding a possible merger or partnership.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel? Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Rudolph Van Gelder (November 2, 1924 - August 25, 2016) was an American recording engineer who specialized in jazz. Regarded as the most important recording engineer of jazz by some observers, Van Gelder recorded several thousand jazz sessions, including many recognized as classics, in a career which spanned more than half a century. Van Gelder recorded many of the great names in the genre, including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, and Horace Silver, among many others. He worked with many record companies but was most closely associated with Blue Note Records. In 1967, Alfred Lion retired from running Blue Note, and the company's owners, Liberty Records (from 1965), began to use other engineers more regularly. Prestige, too, had started to use other studios a few years earlier. Van Gelder remained active in music recording, working as the engineer for most of Creed Taylor's CTI Records releases, a series of proto-smooth jazz albums that were financially successful, but not always well received by critics. Though his output slowed, Van Gelder remained active as a recording engineer into the new century. In the late 1990s he worked as a recording engineer for some of the songs featured on the soundtrack to the TV Show Cowboy Bebop. From 1999, he remastered the analog Blue Note recordings he made several decades earlier into 24-bit digital recordings in its RVG Edition series and also a similar series of remasters of some of the Prestige albums he recorded for its current owners, Concord Records. He was positive about the switch from analog to digital technology. He told Audio magazine in 1995: The biggest distorter is the LP itself. I've made thousands of LP masters. I used to make 17 a day, with two lathes going simultaneously, and I'm glad to see the LP go. As far as I'm concerned, good riddance. It was a constant battle to try to make that music sound the way it should. It was never any good. And if people don't like what they hear in digital, they should blame the engineer who did it. Blame the mastering house. Blame the mixing engineer. That's why some digital recordings sound terrible, and I'm not denying that they do, but don't blame the medium. Van Gelder resided in Englewood Cliffs into this century. He died at his Engelwood Cliffs home on August 25, 2016.

IOC reportedly strips Armstrong of Olympic medal LONDON – The IOC has stripped Lance Armstrong of his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics because of his involvement in doping, officials familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Thursday. Two officials said the IOC sent a letter to Armstrong on Wednesday night asking him to return the medal. The move came after the International Olympic Committee was notified by cycling's governing body that Armstrong had not appealed the decision to disqualify him. The officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the decision hasn't been announced. The IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal. Now that the deadline has expired, the IOC decided to take the medal away. The letter to Armstrong also was sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee. The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs -- after years of denials -- is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The timing of the IOC move, however, was not related to the TV interview. Two months after winning his second Tour de France title in 2000, Armstrong took bronze in Sydney in the road time trial behind winner and U.S. Postal Service teammate Vyacheslav Ekimov of Russia and Jan Ullrich of Germany. The IOC opened a disciplinary case in November after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread doping by Armstrong and his teammates. The report called it the most sophisticated doping program in sports. The IOC will not reallocate Armstrong's bronze medal, just as the UCI decided not to declare any winners for the Tour titles once held by the Texan. Spanish rider Abraham Olano Manzano, who finished fourth in Sydney, will not be upgraded and the bronze medal placing will be left vacant in Olympic records. In August, the IOC stripped Tyler Hamilton, a former Armstrong teammate, of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Athens Olympics after he admitted to doping. In that case, Ekimov was upgraded to gold. The IOC also is investigating Levi Leipheimer, a former Armstrong teammate who won the time-trial bronze at the 2008 Beijing Games. The American confessed to doping as part of his testimony against Armstrong in the USADA case. The IOC is looking into the details of Leipheimer's admitted doping, including when the cheating took place, before moving to strip his medal. Finishing fourth behind Leipheimer in 2008 was Alberto Contador, the Spaniard who was stripped of the 2010 Tour de France title after testing positive for clenbuterol.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Robin Thicke’s ‘Get Her Back’ is an example of how not to do a song about an ex On Monday, Robin Thicke released the video for “Get Her Back,” the first single from his forthcoming album “Paula.” The album, named for Thicke’s estranged wife, actress Paula Patton, is slated to drop on July 1, but Thicke has already received some criticism for its concept — a very public attempt at reconciliation with Patton — and tracklist, which hit the Internet last week. The video has only added to the backlash. Thicke appears with a bloody face in some scenes and stares solemnly into the camera as text messages appear across the screen. Examples: “I wrote a whole album about you.” “I hate myself.” “You embarrassed me.” “You’re reckless.” There’s a lot that’s unclear about the video — why Thicke is bleeding, for one. Nor is there any context for the text messages, so we can only guess as to whether they’re being sent or received. In a particularly troubling moment, Thicke points a finger at his temple. The video ends with a text that reads — rather ominously, following the video’s imagery — “This is just the beginning.” Thicke is no stranger to controversy around his songs or music videos. (Ahem, “Blurred Lines.”) But if we’re buying – literally – into the idea that Thicke wants his wife back, the general consensus is that he’s going about it the wrong way. “What rhymes with desperate?” asked Jezebel. “This might be how you sell a few albums, but it’s certainly not how you reconcile with your estranged wife,” wrote Vulture. If Thicke’s “Paula” offers a look at how not to do a song about someone you love(d), it’s worth taking a look at what goes into making a great song (or even an entire album) about an ex — without it being creepy or anticlimactic. In-laws, am I right? In 2001, Outkast nailed the complexities of shared custody with “Ms. Jackson,” widely understood to be about Andre 3000′s relationship with Erykah Badu. Written as an apology to the mother of an ex, the song gives a detailed — and respectful — look at a relationship that started with good intentions on the part of two people in love. Do we know for sure that it’s about Badu? Of course not. Which brings us to… It’s been more than 40 years since Carly Simon released “You’re So Vain” and we still don’t know who paired a strategically placed hat with an apricot scarf. Simon whispered a clue in a 2009 re-recording of the song, but it didn’t give us the answer, just a qualifier. “You probably think this song is about you” — if your name is David. Alas, David is a very common name. Taylor Swift is arguably the queen of writing about her real-life relationships. Love or loathe her, she keeps it pretty consistent with her breakup-inspired hits. So consistent, in fact, that the liner notes of her most recent albums included coded clues for fans to over-analyze. Swift’s last album “Red,” had fans guessing which songs were about Jake Gyllenhaal. It’s a pretty safe bet that the well-reviewed ballad, “All Too Well” is Gyllenhaal-inspired. And it’s a classic Swift narrative – detailed, but relatable. Kanye West’s genre-eschewing 2008 album, “808s and Heartbreak,” was recorded on the heels of his mother’s death and his breakup with fiance Alexis Phifer. As a result, the album’s lyrics are raw and revealing. Not everyone loved the trip down misery lane, but it was a breakthrough for West, who has only gone on to take more artistic risks (see: “Yeezus“). It’s worth noting that in his review of “808s and Heartbreak,” Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards called it “an album so exquisite, so assured, it threatens to invent an entirely new strand of urban pop music.” Bethonie Butler is a producer and a reporter on The Post’s engagement team.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Context: In March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by the Russian monarchist Piotr Shabelsky-Bork as he was trying to shield the real target, Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party-in-exile. This mistaken, violent death would echo again and again in Nabokov's fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (In Pale Fire, for example, one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet John Shade, when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague. Nabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the emigre community and published under the nom de plume V. Sirin (a reference to the fabulous bird of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons. Of his fifteen Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: \\"He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, the petty immigration officials at the police headquarters.\\" In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her. In May 1923, he met a Russian-Jewish woman, Vera Evseyevna Slonim, at a charity ball in Berlin and married her in April 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934. In 1936, Vera lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment; also in that year the assassin of Nabokov's father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian emigre group. In the same year, Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Russian emigree Irina Guadanini. Yet the family followed him to France, making enroute their last visit to Prague, then spent time in Cannes, Menton, Cap d'Antibes, and Frejus and finally settled together in Paris. In May 1940, the Nabokov family fled from the advancing German troops to the United States on board the SS Champlain, with the exception of Nabokov's brother Sergei, who died at the Neuengamme concentration camp on 9 January 1945. Question: Did Vera go with him. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Vera went with Vladimir Nabokov. They first met at a charity ball in Berlin, got married, and had a child named Dmitri. When they left Germany for France, Vera and Dmitri followed Vladimir. Later, when the family had to leave France because of the advancing German troops, they all moved to the United States together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hoping to snap a two-game losing streak, the Broncos remained on home ground for an AFC West duel against the Oakland Raiders. The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. The Raiders responded, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, but the Broncos countered, with a 21-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater at the end of the first quarter. A 24-yard field goal by Janikowski just before halftime was the only scoring play of the second quarter.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Revised ObamaCare sign-up deadline Tuesday President Obama speaks during his end-of-the-year news conference at the White House in Washington, Friday, Dec. 20, 2013.(AP) While millions of Americans make a last-minute rush to stores to find one more Christmas present Tuesday, Americans in 36 states are getting one more opportunity to sign up for ObamaCare after the White House extended Monday's deadline by 24 hours. The deadline to sign up for insurance in order to have coverage by Jan. 1 was supposed to be Tuesday at midnight. But the administration has programmed its systems so that anyone who got in line Monday but takes until Tuesday night to enroll will still get covered by Jan 1. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tried to downplay the change. A spokeswoman continued to stress that the deadline is technically Monday, even while confirming it would be pushed back to Tuesday. \\"The deadline for signing up for coverage to start January 1 is today,\\" spokeswoman Julie Bataille said. \\"We recognize that many have chosen to make their final decisions on today's deadline and we are committed to making sure they can do so. Anticipating high demand and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones, we have taken steps to make sure that those who select a plan through tomorrow will get coverage for Jan 1.\\" CMS confirmed the change after The Washington Post first reported it. The acknowledgement came as applicants encountered site problems on Monday, with users being placed in a virtual waiting line when the system was overloaded. But the agency compared the tweak to Election Day, when people in line when the polls close would still get to vote. Still, the ObamaCare rollout has been marked by a series of delays, both minor and major. Another, letting those whose plans were canceled sign up for bare-bones coverage, was announced right before the holiday break. A Republican National Committee spokesman called the latest delay an \\"opaque move\\" from an administration that vowed to be transparent. In Ohio, Republican Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor called the deadline extension \\"a clear sign Healthcare.gov continues to struggle.\\" \\"Consumers are already confused and insurers are overwhelmed with the administration's last-minute changes, yet there seems to be no end in sight,\\" said Taylor, who heads Ohio's insurance department, said. The administration claimed that the site was running well Monday afternoon, saying Healthcare.gov received a record 850,000 visits, five times the number logged by the same time last Monday. Bataille said the system was handling the volume with error rates of less than 1 in 200 and response times of less than one second. Obama said on Friday that more than 1 million Americans had enrolled for coverage since Oct. 1. The administration's estimates call for 3.3 million to sign up by Dec. 31, and the target is 7 million by the end of March. After that, people who fail to buy coverage can face tax penalties. Minnesota, one of the states running their own insurance exchanges, extended its Monday deadline to Dec. 31 amid problems with its website and extra-long hold times to reach its help center. Maryland pushed back its cutoff date to Dec. 27. New York extended its deadline to midnight Tuesday. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"The Obama administration extended the deadline for Americans in 36 states to sign up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by 24 hours, giving them an additional opportunity to sign up for insurance and have coverage by January 1st. The original deadline was Tuesday at midnight, but the extension allowed those who started the process on Monday to enroll until Tuesday night. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) downplayed the change, with spokeswoman Julie Bataille stressing that the deadline was still technically Monday.

I having been going in to get quick trims, and I usually like to be there at 9 in the morning. At that time, there are rarely other patrons around. I usually get Nena, as she probably is the first to arrive there, along with the owner (who sticks to nails, I think). Nena is very nice, not too talkative and very assertive. She is one of the few people who gets how to trim bangs for 20-somethings, without making them look lame or like \\"emos\\". The price for these types of trims is about 15, and the service will take about 15 minutes. I have also gone in for pedicures, and have been satisfied though you could probably get the same service elsewhere (is there any stripmall in Vegas without a nail salon?) for about 5 dollars less. One of the worst things here is the fact that they recently decided to not accept tips with your credit card bill. This means that you have to bring cash in, or you will have to forgo leaving a tip, which I consider quiet rude. I do not really know why they did this, though I'm thinking it has to do with cutting back on expenses (i.e., paying bank fees). Whatever the reason, I think this policy makes the client uncomfortable, and she or he will likely leave the salon feeling akward. However, since they implemented this policy, I have gone in about four times, and I have never had cash with me. They go ahead and run my card, and the bill includes a \\"tip ____\\", which I have proceeded to add, despite the annoyed look I get from the receptionist, as well as the \\"this is the last time miss, we are no longer accepting tips like this\\" statement.

The reviewer feels that the pedicures offered at the salon could also be found elsewhere for about 5 less. 2. The salon's recent policy of not accepting tips with credit card payments is seen as inconvenient and makes the client feel uncomfortable. 3. This change of policy may be due to cutting back on expenses, such as bank fees, which the reviewer finds inconsiderate towards clients. 4. The reviewer has encountered an annoyed receptionist and a warning statement regarding the new tipping policy, which may cause further discomfort for clients. In summary, while the reviewer has had overall positive experiences with the salon's services and stylists, there are concerns regarding tipping policies and the value of specific services, such as pedicures.

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\\"the surroundings\\").[note 3] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive?","completion":"Some examples of systems or organisms that are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive include: 1. Photosynthetic bacteria and algae: These organisms can convert sunlight into chemical energy with an efficiency of up to 6%, which is higher than the efficiency found in many higher plants. 2. Electric cars: They convert electrical energy to mechanical energy with an efficiency of around 85-90%, making them more energy-efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars, which have efficiencies around 20-30%. 3. Combined heat and power (CHP) systems: These systems generate electricity and useful thermal energy in a single, integrated system, thus capturing and using the waste heat from electricity generation, reaching efficiencies of up to 80% or more. 4. Gibbons: These arboreal primates can swing through trees at high speeds using relatively little energy due to their specialized anatomy and energy-efficient locomotion technique called brachiation. It's important to note that these examples are context-specific, and their energy efficiency may not be universally applicable or comparable across all situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Neil had to go to night classes unlike Samuel, because","completion":"Neil had a day job that he could not afford to give up. Samuel, on the other hand, had the luxury of attending college full-time because of the scholarship he received. The friends had grown up together and dreamt of pursuing similar careers in the field of computer programming. They each had their unique strengths: Neil took on practical projects to learn on the job, while Samuel would dive into the depths of theory and experiment with intricate algorithms. They made a spectacular team, often working on assigning freelance tasks to each other whenever they had free time. Every evening, as the sun set and the shadow of twilight danced across the city's buildings, Neil would hop onto his old but trusty bicycle and pedal his way to the community college. The autumn air was growing cooler – a signal of the upcoming winter – but nothing would deter Neil from attending his classes. He knew their shared passion would ultimately lead them to their dream careers side by side. The ride to the college would typically take Neil about thirty minutes, giving him ample time to reminisce on past memories with Samuel and muse about the future they both aspired to. There were always a few moments of sadness, as he couldn't help but feel envious of Samuel's privileged position. But Neil was determined and optimistic, knowing that hard work, grit, and sheer determination would eventually pay off. As he rode through the dimly lit streets, the city came to life with the hustle and bustle of nocturnal activities. Street vendors and food trucks lined the edges, tempting him with their delicious aromas. Musicians played their hearts out in small, poorly lit venues, their creativity spilling out into the streets for all to enjoy. And amongst the chaos, Neil found solace and motivation. The night classes were tough, pushing Neil to his limits as he tried to balance his day job and learning of new coding languages. His classmates were a mixed bunch – people from different walks of life, who had come together under the same roof for the same purpose, each with their story to share. Neil found inspiration in their stories and made new friends who understood the unique struggles of balancing work and education. One evening, midway through the semester, Neil was working on a group project tasked with designing a software that could help optimize the city's waste management system. His group was comprised of Gavin, a middle-aged man who had been laid off from his factory job; Emily, a young mother eager to return to the workforce to support her family; and Jess, a young whiz-kid with no formal education but had a remarkably intuitive grasp of coding. The group was incredibly supportive of each other as they worked long, caffeine-fueled nights trying to perfect their prototype. It wasn't long before Neil began to notice the uniqueness of their individual talents and perspectives blending to create something truly spectacular. They had their fair share of disagreements, but in the end, they always managed to find common ground. Towards the end of semester, their software was submitted for grading and eventually chosen to be presented at a tech conference - an opportunity for funding and potential market entry. The excitement reverberated among the group members as they prepared their presentation. Neil knew that this project was something special, and the chance to showcase their hard work was a taste of what he and Samuel had always dreamt about. Neil's hard work finally paid off when their project received massive applause at the conference, won the admiration of their professors, and attracted the interest of venture capitalists willing to put forward funding to turn their prototype into a full-fledged product. As Neil stared into the auditorium filled with applause, his thoughts drifted towards Samuel. He knew that Samuel would be proud of him, but there remained the lingering fear that their divergent journeys might eventually drive them apart. Neil decided then and there that their friendship was of utmost importance. He vowed to ensure that despite their different paths, they would never forget their shared dreams and the moments they spent working together. In the years that followed, Neil and Samuel pursued their separate ways, occasionally collaborating on joint projects and always encouraging one another. Eventually, their unwavering friendship and determination would lead them to cofound a successful start-up, achieving the very dream they had envisioned during their childhood. Their days of night classes and scholarships, of jealousy and envy, would just be anecdotes to recount during late-night programming sessions and company-wide team-building events. And that is how Neil's journey through night classes, a result of his determination and resilience, catalyzed not only his success but also the transformation of his friendship with Samuel and many others. His story will live on as a testament to the power of hard work, friendship, and the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a creature named The Once-ler, a being who is never seen, except for his long green arms. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans. Unable to sing because of the smog, the Lorax sends them off. The Once-ler claims he will 'think about it,' but this answer does not sit well with the Lorax.

These creatures coexist in the environment with the Humming Fish and the Swomee Swans, all dependent on the truffula trees for their livelihood. The story revolves around the Once-ler, who initially comes to the area and is mesmerized by the beauty and uniqueness of the truffula trees. He decides to establish a business by cutting down the trees and using their tufts to create a multipurpose item called Thneed. As the demand for Thneeds grows, the Once-ler's business expands, harming the environment and causing devastating consequences for the local ecosystem. The Lorax, who claims to speak for the trees, tries to warn the Once-ler of the damage he's causing. He points out the consequences, such as the Bar-ba-Loots running out of truffula fruits to eat, the Swomee Swans being unable to sing due to the smog from the factories, and the pollution in the Humming Fish's pond. Despite the Lorax's attempts to save the environment and the creatures living there, the Once-ler is consumed by the success of his business and fails to take immediate action.

The like terms are -14*o and 4*o. Subtract 4o from -14o to yield -10o. Thus, the simplified equation becomes 0 = -10*o - 40. Step 2: Re-arrange the equation This gets all the 'o' terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Adding 10*o to both sides gives 10*o = - 40. Step 3: Divide by coefficient of o In this equation, the coefficient of 'o' is 10. So you divide by 10 on both sides. Hence, the solution of the equation is o = -40 / 10.

Advantage will be taken of his offer.","completion":"The sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable, though it may sound somewhat formal and less common in everyday conversation. It is a passive construction, meaning the action is emphasized rather than the person or entity performing the action. It is also a future construction, indicating that the action of taking advantage of the offer has not yet occurred. Let's break down the sentence structure and components to better understand its linguistic acceptability: 1. Subject: In this passive construction, the subject is \\"advantage,\\" which serves as the entity that the action is applied to or affected by. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"will\\" is used to indicate the future tense in English and implies that the action has not yet taken place, but is expected to at a later point in time. 3. Main verb: \\"be taken\\" is the passive form of the verb \\"take\\"; it is conjugated in the passive voice to place emphasis on the action (taking advantage) rather than on the person or entity performing the action. In this case, it is not specified who will be taking advantage of the offer. 4. Prepositional phrase: \\"of his offer\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides specific information about the source or object related to the taking of advantage in this sentence. Although linguistically acceptable, this sentence might sound quite formal and may not be the most common way people would express the same idea in everyday spoken English. An alternative and more common way to phrase the same meaning would be: \\"We will take advantage of his offer.\\" This revised sentence is more direct, as it is in the active voice and clearly identifies the person or entity doing the action. However, both sentences convey the same essential meaning. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable as it follows the rules of grammar and syntax within the English language, though it may not be the most common way to express the idea in everyday conversation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dec. 3, 2014 AUSTIN, Texas — A preliminary university investigation has revealed that UT environmental health and safety officials disposed of multiple brain specimens in approximately 2002 in accordance with protocols concerning biological waste. This was done in coordination with faculty members who determined that the specimens had been in poor condition when the university received them in the 1980s and were not suitable for research or teaching. Faculty members then maintained possession of other brain specimens in the collection that the university continues to own. This occurred prior to the renovation of the Animal Resources Center, where the specimens had been stored in a secure location. We believe the workers disposed of between 40 and 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains, and worked with a biological waste contractor to do so safely. We are continuing to investigate reports that additional brain specimens were separately sent to other universities or health institutions. Thus far, we have not found any records or documentation to corroborate accounts that some specimens were shared with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio in the 1990s. We have no evidence at this time that any of the brain specimens came from Charles Whitman, though we will continue to investigate those reports. The university will also investigate how the decision was made to dispose of some of these specimens and how all brain specimens have been handled since the university received its collection from the Austin State Hospital in the 1980s. University officials will appoint a broader investigative committee to examine these issues. As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously. University statement from earlier in the day on Dec. 3, 2014: As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously. We are committed to treating the brain specimens with respect and are disheartened to learn that some of them may be unaccounted for. The university plans to investigate the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago. The brains that are now on campus are actively used as a teaching tool and are carefully curated by faculty. As our investigation proceeds, we will seek to confirm whether the specific details that have been reported about the other specimens are accurate. For more information, contact: University Communications, Office of the President, 512 471 3151. Related Content ||||| Earlier on Wednesday, a professor at the Austin school told reporters that the brains had been sent to the University of Texas in San Antonio. Hours later, that school denied receiving them, suggesting the brains might have gone to another, separate facility, the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. A spokesman there said they were investigating. ||||| The University of Texas statement said the health and safety officials were thought to have disposed of 40 to 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains. Photo “As far as we know, that accounts for all of them,” said Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the university. “But we’re continuing our investigation to make sure that none went to other institutions.” Mr. Hannaford said he was skeptical of the university’s conclusion that the 100 brains had all been disposed of.

According to the statement, the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection. Last year in Indianapolis, David Charles, 21, was charged with stealing 60 human brains from the Indiana Medical History Museum. The police were tipped off by Brian Kubasco of San Diego, who had bought six of the brains on eBay for 600, and suspected they were stolen. About 48 of the brains were returned to the museum, which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital. All of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a half-century through the 1940s. “These brain collections go back to the mid-1800s, and it’s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear,” said Brian Burrell, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor and author of “Postcards From the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds.” Disposing of such a collection can be awkward, he said, since it may not be possible to give away the brains. Sometimes, he said, an institution does not even know it has them. EBay policy prohibits the sale of human remains, with the exception of hair and skulls, as well as skeletons sold for medical use. But enforcement is not air tight, as evidenced by the Indiana case. While a federal law protecting the burial sites of Native Americans prohibits trade in Indian funeral objects and human remains, it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains. Some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished. “There was one collection of 600 brains, by a Philadelphia anatomist, and no one knows where they are,” Mr. Burrell said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about a university in Texas that had some human brain specimens.

It is a very different vehicle from the starships he captained in Star Trek. William Shatner has revealed plans to drive across America in a unique vehicle. The 83 year-old actor, who usually drives a 2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, will ride from Chicago to Los Angeles this summer on the Rivet, a custom made tricycle he helped design. Scroll down for video. The finished trike will be a two seater powered by a V8 engine, and will transport Shatner across America this summer. Shatner helped design the trike, which will go on sale later this year. Shatner says the design is inspired by an aircraft wing from the B-17 bomber. 'The finest line I can ever remember seeing was on a wing,' he said. 'Bombardier had lend me an aeroplane, and I remember the sweeping stainless steel part of the wing. 'If design can move you emotionally, that did - and I want to see that in the bike' To make the trike a reality, Shatner is working with Illinois company American Wrench, a motorcycle fabrication firm that's provided frames to Orange County Choppers among others. He has worked with the firm on the design, requesting many of the features - and rejecting a few others. 'To me, flame throwers are a little excessive,' he tells them in one meeting. The two seater trike will have a canopy to protect riders, and, crucially for shatner, will also be able to wheelie. 'This will do a wheelie in 4th gear,' he says. 'I've been across this country in sport cars, in trucks, with a dog, with a my family, and I want to do it on a motorcycle - and I'm going to do it on the rivet.' The bike is covered in rivets to keep with the aircraft wing design. Although thse mockups show a one seater, the finished trike will have two. The firm says: 'Rivet is a type of vehicle we call 'Landjet'. Designed from the ground up as a 3 wheeled vehicle, with its exposed cockpit and command centre, seating fit only for a captain and the harmonious roar of its brute V8, piloting it gives you the feeling of flying on the open road. Rivet's intent is not only to draw attention to the pilot or the vehicle itself, but to the art and craft of hand built machines, done in the spirit of keeping America's 'routes' alive. The B-17 was primarily employed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets.

Premise: \\"Therefore, the impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Therefore, the impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution\\" is true, it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances.\\" This is because the premise suggests that the rule's impact differs among different businesses and their positions within the production and distribution chain, implying that the rule has significant and varying effects on businesses. On the other hand, the hypothesis implies that the rule does not have any genuine impact, with no significant variations or exceptions. To analyze this contradiction further, we can break down both statements and compare their implications: Premise: The impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution. - There are different types of businesses, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and service providers. - The production and distribution chain can be understood as a sequence of stages, from producing a good or service to distributing and selling it to the end customer. - The rule in question, according to this premise, has differing effects on businesses depending on their type and position within this chain. - This implies that there are varying degrees of impact (e.g., high impact on manufacturers but low impact on retailers) or different consequences (e.g., the rule might affect pricing strategies for wholesalers but labor practices for manufacturers). Hypothesis: This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances. - The impact of the rule is minimal or nonexistent, suggesting that it does not significantly affect the way businesses in the chain of production and distribution operate. - There are no real exceptions or variances, meaning that the rule consistently has little to no effect across all types of businesses and their positions within the production and distribution chain. - This implies that the rule does not play a meaningful role in influencing business operations, strategies, or overall outcomes for any organization. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the premise and the hypothesis present opposing perspectives on the impact of the rule. If the premise is assumed to be true, it would indicate that the rule has a range of effects on businesses depending on their type and place in the production and distribution process. In contrast, the hypothesis claims the rule has minimal to no impact across the board, with no significant variations. Consequently, since both statements cannot be accurate simultaneously, the truth of the premise would negate the validity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: At first, it can help to blot your kitty dry with a towel before you wrap him in a towel. This will help get off some of the dampness and will keep him from feeling like you're trapping him in a wet enclosure. Just gently blotting his face, body, and fur can make your kitty feel a bit more relaxed before you place him in a towel. Some people even use hair dryers on the lowest setting to help dry their kittens. You have to do what works best for your cat. Some are fascinated by the dryer and some are are terrified of it. If your kitty is okay with the hairdryer, then place it on the lowest heat setting and gently dry his fur just as you would with your hair, only taking a bit more care not to scare your kitty or harm him. Once you manage this, you should quickly dry the cat to get most of the dampness off. Be aware that small animals can lose a great deal of body temperature through damp fur so dry the kitten as much as possible, before providing a heat source for him/her to dry in front of. The towel may make the kitty feel a little claustrophobic and he may panic a little, but it's important to dry him off as much as you can. Your kitty will likely also shake the water off himself, like a dog. If you have a long-haired kitty, then you should brush his fur after the bath to get rid of any tangles that maybe have been caused by the bath. Afterwards, offer treats, cuddles, hugs, and kisses. Your poor baby has just experienced one of the worst things it can. Most cats hate water! (However, two exceptions are the Turkish Van, and Bengal breeds.)

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Thursday the agency paid more to get into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters than he will make in the remaining seven years and four months he has in his job. The Apple logo is pictured at its flagship retail store in San Francisco, California January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith According to figures from the FBI and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Comey’s annual salary as of January 2015 was 183,300. Without a raise or bonus, Comey will make 1.34 million over the remainder of his job. That suggests the FBI paid the largest ever publicized fee for a hacking job, easily surpassing the 1 million paid by U.S. information security company Zerodium to break into phones. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in London, Comey was asked by a moderator how much the FBI paid for the software that eventually broke into the iPhone. “A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure,” Comey said. “But it was, in my view, worth it.” The Justice Department said in March it had unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone with the help of an unidentified third party and dropped its case against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), ending a high-stakes legal clash but leaving the broader fight over encryption unresolved. Comey said the FBI will be able to use software used on the San Bernardino phone on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software. There are about 10 million 5C iPhones in use in the United States, according to estimates from research firm IHS Technology. Eighty-four percent of iOS devices overall are running iOS 9 software, according to Apple. The FBI gained access to the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 2. The case raised the debate over whether technology companies’ encryption technologies protect privacy or endanger the public by blocking law enforcement access to information. (This version was officially corrected to change active U.S. 5C iPhone estimates to 10 million from 16 million in paragraph 8 after analyst IHS corrects figure.) ||||| FBI Director James Comey suggested Thursday that the bureau paid more than 1 million to access an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, the first time the agency has offered a possible price tag in the high-profile case. While speaking at a security forum in London hosted by the Aspen Institute, Comey would not offer a precise dollar figure, saying only that it cost “a lot” to get into the phone. He said the cost of the tool was “more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.” As he made his remark, Comey, a former federal prosecutor who speaks precisely in public settings, paused as if to consider the math he was performing in his head. The FBI director serves a 10-year term, though Comey’s predecessor, Robert S. Mueller III, served for 12 years after Congress approved a request from President Obama to extend his tenure. Comey was confirmed July 2013 and took office in September of that year, so he has more than seven years left in his term. According to the federal statute detailing his salary, Comey is paid the rate set for Level II of the executive salary schedule. That means he makes 185,100 a year, under the pay schedules that went into effect this year. As a result, Comey’s remarks strongly implied that the bureau paid at least 1.3 million to get onto the phone, which had belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, killed 14 people during the Dec. 2 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. “But it was, in my view, worth it,” the FBI director said of what it cost to access the phone’s data. [The San Bernardino case is already changing Apple’s arguments over another locked iPhone] An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on Comey’s remarks. Federal authorities have not publicly revealed who helped the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, which was at the center of an extended fight between the government and Apple. The Justice Department had maintained that only Apple could help it access the phone without erasing all of its data before abruptly saying it had gotten help from an outside party and no longer needed Apple’s assistance. According to people familiar with the issue, the FBI cracked the phone with the help of professional hackers who were paid a one-time flat fee. Law enforcement officials have said recently that the FBI has found no links to foreign terrorists on the phone, though they are still hoping that geolocation data on the device could help reveal what the attackers did during an 18-minute period after the shooting. Earlier this month, Comey had said that the government was considering telling Apple how it accessed the phone, though he acknowledged that if that happened, the technology giant would fix the flaw and close off that avenue. But he said the tool would only work on a “narrow slice” of devices, saying he was “pretty confident” it would not work on newer models. Comey conceded Thursday that the tool would work only on an iPhone 5c running iOS 9. In part because of the price tag, Comey said he hoped the government could figure out a solution to access other, more current phones without having to make mass appeals to the tech industry for some kind of hack. He noted that there were 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that might want to access phones and could not afford what the FBI paid to access the San Bernardino phone. The FBI’s total budget for fiscal year 2016 was more than 8.7 billion, and the bureau requested more than 9.5 billion for fiscal year 2017. “I’m hoping that we can somehow get to a place where we have a sensible solution, or set of solutions, that doesn’t involve hacking, it doesn’t involve spending tons of money in a way that’s un-scaleable,” Comey said. Further reading: Justice Dept. still wants to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case The FBI has weighed whether the San Bernardino tool can help state and local law enforcement The Justice Department said tech companies have accessed phones for it before. So the ACLU tried to find all the cases. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A man named James Comey is in charge of the FBI. The FBI needed help to get information from a locked iPhone that belonged to a man who did something very bad. The FBI paid a lot of money to people who know how to unlock iPhones. They paid so much money that it was more than what James Comey earns in more than seven years. Eventually, the iPhone was unlocked and they got the information they needed. This was important, but it cost a lot of money. So now, they are looking for a better way to unlock iPhones in the future without spending so much."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

Question: What is the full name of the person who states his doubt that the audience ever believed he and Isabel Bigley were deeply in love? Answer the above question based on the context below: The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses.

His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.","completion":"This text is about John D.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss. But Henrietta explains that she and Sam are bound together most profoundly: when she was young, Sam was the handsome stable boy. Overcome with desire, they ran away and married at Gretna Green. Henrietta's brother, furious that aristocratic Henrietta had paired up with a lowly servant, confronted them. Her brother shot at them and missed; she then shot her brother fatally. Sam made a false confession to save her, and was sent to the penal colony in Australia. She followed him and waited seven years in abject poverty for his release.

The waterway mentioned connects the inland port of Duluth on Lake Superior, which is part of the Great Lakes system, to the Atlantic Ocean. The total distance of this waterway is 2,340 miles (3,770 km), allowing the passage of ships between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, the waterway also extends to Chicago on Lake Michigan, with a distance of 2,250 miles (3,620 km). This connection is made possible by a network of canals, locks, and channels that have been constructed to facilitate shipping between the Great Lakes Basin and the Atlantic Ocean. Key components of this network include the Welland Canal, which bypasses the Niagara Falls between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is a series of canals and locks that enable navigation between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Ocean. The St. Lawrence Seaway, in particular, plays a crucial role in connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. Inaugurated in 1959, the seaway is jointly managed by Canada and the United States, and it has facilitated the movement of millions of tons of cargo between the lake ports and global markets. In summary, the waterway system connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean allows for navigation and access between these two major water bodies.

Elliot Sperling, a specialist of Indian studies and the director of the Tibetan Studies program at Indiana University’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that \\"the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction.\\" He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century. He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because \\"Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus\\" and also that \\"China's intervening Ming dynasty ... had no control over Tibet.\\" He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \\"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.Josef Kolmaš, a sinologist, Tibetologist, and Professor of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, writes that it was during the Qing dynasty \\"that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government.\\" Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.P.

(CNN)Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in April have been converted to Islam and married off. Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group. The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world. In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials. \\"Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?\\" Abubakar Shekau said. \\"They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.\\" Shekau slammed reports of their planned release. \\"We married them off. They are in their marital homes,\\" he said, chuckling. The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram. \\"We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,\\" he said of the negotiator. It wasn't clear when the video was made. Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said these assertions contradict those made in the group's talks with the Nigerian government. Omeri said the government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video. \\"We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,\\" Omeri said. \\"Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight.\\" Nigeria said officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby. The ceasefire deal announced on October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad. That day passed without any signs of the girls. Boko Haram a growing challenge. In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more \\"war, striking and killing with gun.\\" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead. Days later, the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria. Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about 9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said. For its part, Nigeria isn't backing down. It is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said Saturday. The military said its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two states in the northeast that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram. Officials are \\"studying\\" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said. Boko Haram, whose name translates to \\"Western education is sin\\" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state. The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government. As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children, and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. CNN's Isha Sesay, Lillian Leposo, Christabelle Fombu, Greg Botelho and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Boko Haram, a group in Nigeria that doesn't want kids to go to school and does bad things, has said that they are not going to stop doing these things.

This group kidnapped many school girls earlier this year and now say these girls have been made to follow their religion and married to men in their group. The leader of the group also threatened to harm a man who was said to help make the deal with the Nigerian government. The Nigerian government is trying to check if what the group is saying is true and is still trying to bring the kidnapped girls back. Even though the group is causing harm, the Nigerian government is fighting back and trying to protect its people.

It was built during the time when Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and was inaugurated by him in 1969. Hypothesis: St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral was inaugurated by a Pop from Egypt.","completion":"Based on the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt. To reach this conclusion, let us first analyze the information provided in the context: 1. St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic church situated in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt. 2. The cathedral serves as the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. 3. Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church around the time the cathedral was built. 4. The cathedral was inaugurated by Pope Cyril VI in 1969. From points 1 and 2, it is clear that the cathedral is closely connected to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which is an Egyptian Christian tradition. Thus, the cathedral's location in Egypt, and it being the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, implies a strong link to Egyptian culture and religious leadership. Point 3 identifies Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria as the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church when the cathedral was constructed. In the Coptic Orthodox tradition, the Pope of Alexandria is the highest spiritual authority within the church. Since Alexandria is a city in Egypt, it can reasonably be assumed that Pope Cyril VI was an Egyptian leader within the church. Finally, point 4 confirms that Pope Cyril VI indeed inaugurated St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Combining this fact with the previous information, we can confidently conclude that the cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt – in this specific case, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria.

The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise.

She blinked, trying to adjust to the dim surroundings, and her gaze fell upon the tumbled blind. Cautiously, Betty slipped from beneath the cozy warmth of her quilt and tiptoed over to the window. The night air swirled in around her, cold and crisp, as she peered out into the densely wooded background that surrounded her little home. The trees were swaying slowly, their limbs dancing in the moonlight. Betty's breath fogged the window, blurring the world outside with each exhale. Betty couldn't help but feel a shiver run down her spine. She sensed that there was something unusual about the night, something that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. The wind whispered softly, carrying secrets it refused to tell. Her heart began to beat faster, a rhythm of primal fear that drummed through her veins. As she moved to close the window, Betty noticed a flicker of movement from the corner of her eye. She froze in place, her gaze drawn to a figure standing at the edge of the woods, shrouded in the night like a phantom. The figure was tall and featureless, its head slightly tilted as if regarding her curiously. Instinctively, Betty's hand flew to her throat, her stomach twisting with a mixture of dread and fascination. The figure took a step closer and although Betty's mind screamed at her to flee, she remained rooted to the spot. She watched, her eyes widening as the moonlight revealed a pair of piercing green eyes staring at her, entreating her to come closer. Something about those eyes was eerily mesmerizing, and despite every fiber of her being telling her to shut the window and lock the door, it was too late. She inadvertently took a step towards the figure, her curiosity overriding her terror. Suddenly, a howl broke the silence of the night, its intensity shattering the spell that held Betty captive. She gasped in horror, forcefully shutting the window and catapulting herself back into the safety of her bed. Heart pounding deafeningly in her ears, she rubbed her eyes, wondering if she had been dreaming. When she peered out the window once more, the figure was gone. Betty spent the remainder of the night gripped by fear, jumping at every sound and shadow that played at the edge of her thoughts. As the first rays of morning light crept in through her window, she wondered if she had imagined it all. The haunting presence she had felt, the ethereal figure lurking at the edge of the woods - could any of it have been real? That morning, Betty decided to investigate her surroundings. As she traversed the edge of the woods, she discovered a set of mysterious footprints near the spot she'd seen the figure standing. Frightened by her discovery, she rushed home and found herself unable to shake the memory of those green eyes. Her earlier questions about reality and sanity became replaced with a burning desire to uncover the truths the night held, and each passing day brought with it a growing obsession to unravel the identity of her nocturnal visitor. What Betty did not know was that her encounter would be the start of a journey that would lead her down a path of ancient magic, forbidden love, and long-lost secrets. The wind that night had not only knocked the blind from her window, but also, inexorably, the course of her life, guiding her toward a destiny she could never have imagined. From that night on, Betty's life was forever changed: a new chapter began, as each darkness gave way to mysteries and strange encounters, propelling her into a realm where things that go bump in the night held startling truths, and where the boundaries separating the mundane from the magical no longer held sway."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Passage: Ripley's Believe It or Not! is the name of several documentary television series based on the newspaper feature. The first series aired on NBC from 1949 to 1950, and was hosted by Robert L. Ripley until his death, after which several substitute hosts filled in. The series was revived again on ABC, running from 1982-1986, and was hosted primarily by Jack Palance. Another revival debuted on TBS in 2000, and aired until 2003, with Dean Cain as the host. A Filipino version, hosted by Chris Tiu, debuted in 2008. An animated series based on the Ripley's franchise was also created, and premiered in 1999. Another revival premiered on Travel Channel in June 2019, with Bruce Campbell as the host.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The only bad thing is during the third movie Mike got really sick . 100 degree fever , chills , and lots of pain everywhere . I gave him two vitamin c pills , a tylenol to reduce the fever and lots of water . He fell asleep in the bedroom , waking up twice , and this morning outside of sore and sleepy he seems ok . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why was Mike unable to get a good night of sleep ?","completion":"Based on the passage provided, Mike was unable to get a good night of sleep due to multiple factors which primarily revolved around his health. To provide a detailed analysis for the question, let's break down the contributing factors individually: 1. 100-degree fever: Mike was suffering from a high fever, which is a natural response of the body to fight off infections or other potential threats. A fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit is considered significant and can be the primary reason for causing discomfort and disturbing sleep. Elevated body temperature can lead to increased restlessness, sweating, and difficulty in finding a comfortable sleeping position. 2. Chills: The passage mentions that Mike experienced chills, which is a common symptom accompanying fever. Chills typically involve involuntary muscle contractions, making the person feel cold and shiver. This sensation can cause further discomfort and restlessness during the night, making it difficult for Mike to get a good night's sleep. 3. Pain everywhere: When Mike's entire body was in pain, finding a comfortable sleeping position or staying asleep would have been difficult. Pain can cause significant distress, interfere with one's ability to relax, and prevent the person from falling asleep or staying asleep for an extended duration. 4. Waking up twice: The combination of fever, chills, and pain could have led to Mike waking up multiple times during the night. Disrupted sleep patterns due to such interruptions would have made it even more challenging for Mike to get a good night's sleep and recover. Moreover, Mike's health was being supported with interventions such as vitamin C pills, Tylenol for fever reduction, and plenty of water to combat dehydration often associated with fever. Though these interventions aimed to alleviate the symptoms, Mike's body was still coping and fighting off the underlying issue. Despite the efforts of providing him with medical support, Mike's body was still working hard to recover, leaving him feeling sore and sleepy the following morning. Consequently, the combination of Mike's 100-degree fever, chills, body pain, and waking up multiple times during the night resulted in him being unable to get a good night's sleep."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: That isn't an assertion about today's politics. It was the verdict of the US Central Intelligence Agency on Labour back in 1985, in a memo for the agency's director on the early phase of Neil Kinnock's leadership. This memo is one of millions of the CIA's historical records which have just been made available online. Previously researchers had to actually visit the US National Archives in Maryland in order to access this database of declassified documents. The records reveal the deep level of concern inside the CIA about the strength of the Left within Labour in the early 1980s, a political force which the agency regarded as anti-American. A report written in the run-up to the 1983 general election states that \\"a Labor majority government would represent the greatest threat to US interests\\". The agency was particularly worried by Labour's then policy of opposition to nuclear weapons, which included cancelling plans for the Trident submarine programme. This report was especially scathing about leading figures on the traditionally pro-nuclear Labour right who had compromised with this stance. It said that \\"most disheartening from the viewpoint of US interests\\" was the position of the party's deputy leader, Denis Healey. It reported that he still had ambitions to lead the party and as a result \\"he apparently has decided to appease the left by attacking US arms control policy, denouncing Trident, and denying he ever supported the NATO INF [Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] program\\". The report added that the growing power of the Left meant that \\"even moderates like Healey have been forced to ape anti-American rhetoric\\". Entitled \\"The British Labor Party: Caught between Ideology and Reality\\", the document is a detailed account of the balance of power between left and right in the party and trade unions, as seen by the CIA. It also records that leading Labour politicians had told US officials they did not take all of the party's policy programme seriously. The CIA was also concerned by what it saw as Europe's large centre-left and socialist parties (including Labour) being too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. One 1982 report concluded \\"We have long contended that Moscow's most effective allies in Western Europe are not the Communist Parties, but self-styled Social Democrats who have betrayed the original tenets of social democracy.\\" Another newly accessible document is a record of a 1981 meeting between delegations led by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Margaret Thatcher, who was on a prime ministerial visit to Washington. The meeting discussed the controversial American plans for an Enhanced Radiation Weapon (ERW), more commonly known as the \\"neutron bomb\\", a weapon which was said to be able to kill very large numbers of people while leaving buildings standing. Also present at the meeting was Mrs Thatcher's Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, who told the Americans that \\"it is considered unsporting in Europe for a weapon to kill people only\\". The database contains just two references to the current Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One noted his support in 1986 for an El Salvadoran trade union federation, Fenastras, which was linked to Marxist guerrillas during the country's civil war, while the Americans backed the military government. This is just a small immediate selection from millions of pages covering a wide range of American and international issues which reveal the CIA's analyses and preoccupations in the past. Records relating to more recent events have not yet been declassified. The CIA's decision to make all these documents searchable and accessible followed a legal case brought by MuckRock, a US organisation that promotes access to public records.","completion":"A long time ago, in 1985, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was worried about a group called the Labour party in the United Kingdom. The CIA thought that this group had too much power and that they were not friendly towards America. Recently, a lot of old CIA documents, like this one, were put online so everybody can read them. These documents show some secrets from the past and help us understand what the CIA thought about different countries and people, like the Labour party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is hinted that Darcy didn't have a normal family or childhood by how she constantly goes on about Rachel being the sister she never had and the mother she always wanted. Ethan is Rachel's best guy friend, who also has known Darcy since childhood. There is a history shown that for the 6th grade dance Ethan went with both Rachel and Darcy, presumably because Darcy couldn't let Rachel have a date when she didn't. He is annoyed with Darcy's treatment of Rachel. Darcy has spent years with Rachel always acquiescing to her way because of Darcy's overbearing attitude, to the point where 6 years earlier, Rachel pretty much handed her crush from law school, Dex, over to Darcy.

Context: Back in middle school, at least I think it was, I had art class. I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day.

On the third Sunday in June, fathers all across the United States are given presents, treated to dinner or otherwise made to feel special. However, the idea for creating a day for children to honor their fathers began in Spokane, Washington. A woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909. Having been raised by her father, Henry Jackson Smart, after her mother died, Sonora wanted her father to know how special he was to her. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a selfless and loving man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910. In 1924 President Calvin Coolidge declared the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Roses are the Father's Day flowers: red to be worn for a living father and white if the father has died. When children can't visit their fathers or take them out to dinner, they send a greeting card. Traditionally, fathers prefer greeting cards that are not too sentimental(, ). Most greeting cards are too special so fathers laugh when they open them. Some give heartfelt thanks for being there whenever the child needed Dad.

Additionally, the fact that Aubrey took such a drastic measure over something characterized as \\"petty\\" further reinforces the notion that they possess a short temper and easily become consumed by anger. The other two options do not fit the description of Aubrey's actions. A: a kind person - A kind person would be more supportive, understanding, and empathetic towards their friend's feelings. Instead of reacting out of anger and trying to cause harm, they would try to work through the issue constructively and calmly. Aubrey's actions do not align with this description. C: a forgiving person - A forgiving person would be more willing to let go of hurt feelings, showing compassion even after someone has wronged them. They do not hold grudges and would rather find a way to reconcile the relationship instead of seeking revenge. In this context, Aubrey's actions are the opposite of what a forgiving person would do, as they sought to harm Robin, fueled by anger towards the petty disagreement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Question: What do they call someone born of a parent who practiced witchcraft? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Craft Context: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\". To do so, she plans to \\"call the corners\\" by creating a fire on a beach, so that all four natural elements (earth, fire, air, and water) can be called upon by the four separate girls, to grant them further supernatural abilities. On completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning, and all four girls fall unconscious. Afterward Nancy is... The answer is:","completion":"A person born of a parent who practiced witchcraft is often referred to as a \\"natural witch\\" or a \\"hereditary witch.\\" In the context of the movie \\"The Craft,\\" Sarah Bailey, one of the main characters, is revealed to be a natural witch due to her inherent supernatural powers that she displays from the beginning of the film.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: This can be time before you will see your mother-in-law, or even during a family event. Take some time to be by yourself and reflect on how the relationship feels in the moment. At a difficult family gathering, you can excuse yourself for a short walk around the block, or to make a phone call to a trusted friend. Before you see your mother-in-law, spend some time by yourself. You can use this time to reflect and relax so that you’ll have an easier time when you do see your mother-in-law. You may need to vent to a friend after spending time with your mother-in-law. Have someone on hand whom you can call if you need to. This step can seem drastic, but if your mother-in-law is truly abusive, moving may be the only viable option. Many couples do move based on proximity to in-laws. Living farther away can prevent meddling and unwanted visits. If your mother-in-law’s abuse affects your children, moving away can help assure their safety from her. You can choose whether you and your spouse will be honest about the reason for moving or not. Sometimes, a spouse isn’t willing or able to admit that their mother is abusive. This can cause a rift between partners, and sometimes causes the relationship to end. If your spouse can’t admit that their mother is abusive, offer to see a couple’s therapist together before deciding to end the marriage. Leaving a marriage is a big decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. However, you should never tolerate abuse in order to preserve a marriage. If your mother-in-law has caused trauma for you or your children, you may want to see a therapist even after your mother-in-law is out of your life. Abuse can take years to recover from, even when the abuser is no longer a threat. Even if your spouse doesn't see the abuse, you may still need to deal with its effects on you. Children can be affected by abuse even if they are not consciously aware of it. Make sure they have someone safe to talk to if they've been exposed to abusive behavior.","completion":"The article suggests taking time for oneself and reflecting on the relationship with a mother-in-law, especially during difficult family gatherings. It recommends excusing oneself for a short walk or talking to a trusted friend to vent frustrations. If the mother-in-law is abusive, moving away might be a necessary step to protect oneself and the children. If the spouse denies the abuse, couples therapy could be considered before ending the marriage. Seeking therapy for oneself and children can help recovery from potential trauma caused by the abusive mother-in-law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle. Professor Noodle has just developed a rejuvenation solution that reverses the aging process. Stan and Oliver are chimney sweeps and arrive to sweep the chimney. Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight. Oliver comes back on to the roof and begins to pull the sweep up. Stan has hung on to the sweep and arrives at the roof. Oliver drops him back down through the chimney. Stan doesn't have enough extensions for the sweep and decides to use a rifle to shove the sweep the last part of the way. The gun goes off nearly shooting Oliver. Stan decides to go up to the roof and as he opens the skylight he knocks Oliver off the roof and down onto a greenhouse. Hardy finally falls down the chimney dislodging many bricks, sending a cloud of soot all over the living room and onto the butler, and damaging the piano. The butler says something about an electric chair, and stalks out. Stan and Oliver start to clean up the soot around the fireplace. They become distracted and Stan shovels the soot into Oliver's trousers. Professor Noodle decides to test his rejuvenation solution. He puts a duck in a vat of water and adds a drop of his solution. The duck turns into a duckling. The professor is excited and decides to show Stan and Oliver his discovery. He puts another drop of his solution into the vat and the duckling turns into an egg. Stan and Oliver decide to test the solution for themselves when the professor leaves the room to fetch and rejuvenate the butler. Stan accidentally knocks Oliver and the solution into the vat.

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market.

Heat - Heat can increase evaporation in a lake, which would decrease the amount of water rather than increase it. 4. Nutrients - Nutrients can affect water quality and support life in a lake but do not directly increase water volume. 5. Watershed - A watershed is an area of land that drains water into a specific body of water, like a lake. An increase in water within a watershed can lead to an increase in water volume in the connected lake. 6. Storms - Storms can produce excess rainfall, which can directly increase the volume of water in a lake. 7. Flooding - Flooding, often caused by heavy rainfall, can cause water from rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water to overflow, leading to an increase in lake volume. 8.

Of Jewish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes.

Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school.

Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men.

The tablet shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, says researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin, who deciphered the tablet and published his findings in Science. What's intriguing is that these early astronomers wrote their calculations sometime between 350BC and 50BC—at least 1,400 years earlier than the European mathematicians who currently get credit for inventing the technique, reports NPR. The upshot is that the Babylonians were dabbling in abstract principles dealing with Jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky, and they described that movement using a \\"sort of precalculus,\\" in the words of the New York Times. \\"It is an application in astronomy that was totally new,\\" says Ossendrijver. He calls it \\"truly an astonishing find,\\" and while he may be biased, others in the field seem equally wowed. \\"I think it's quite a remarkable discovery,\\" says a professor at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. The Times has a layman's explainer: \\"The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance.\\" Babylonians were known to be talented astronomers and mathematicians, but the small tablet takes them far above previous estimations, observes National Geographic. \\"This geometrical trick rewrites the history books.\\" (Scientists are getting closer to unraveling an ancient Incan technique as well.)

They used the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, which allowed them to determine how long it took Jupiter to travel half of that distance. While Babylonians were known to be skillful astronomers and mathematicians, this small tablet provides a groundbreaking insight into their advanced knowledge. The geometrical discovery has the potential to rewrite the history of mathematics, as it demonstrates that the Babylonians were utilizing advanced mathematical techniques well before their European counterparts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. Two villages were situated on different sides of the hill. Each village has its own approach to agriculture. East village decided to clear the land, by felling many trees and bushes, and set up a vast irrigation system. West village too a more natural approach to food production and applied the edible forest method, and all the permaculture principles over the years. Which village had more problems with groundwater salinization? A:","completion":"The East village, which decided to clear the land by felling many trees and bushes and set up a vast irrigation system, would have more problems with groundwater salinization. This is because vegetation clearance and extensive irrigation practices can lead to increased salinity levels in groundwater. Vegetation clearance removes the natural root systems and evapotranspiration processes that help maintain the groundwater balance. As a result, the water table rises, increasing the chances of salts being mobilized and eventually reaching the soil surface. This process is further exacerbated by extensive irrigation, which raises the water table and further contributes to salt mobilization. On the other hand, the West village took a more natural approach to food production by applying the edible forest method and permaculture principles. These methods encourage the preservation and maintenance of natural vegetation and promote efficient water use. As a result, the risk of groundwater salinization is reduced in the West village, as the vegetation helps to maintain the water table balance and prevent the mobilization of salts."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the paleolithic, people did not normally live in permanent constructions. In the neolithic, mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster. The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses. The roof was supported by beams from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept.

Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Hint: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Process B would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. The paragraph provides information about two processes, process A and process B, related to hormone secretion from different parts of the adrenal glands. Process A involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex. The cortex releases hormones such as cortisol (helps the body deal with stress) and aldosterone (regulates the balance of minerals in the body). Although cortisol helps the body handle stress, its primary effect is not on increasing oxygen and glucose supply to the muscles. Process B, on the other hand, involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla. The medulla secretes fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline, which prepares the body to respond to emergencies. Adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, allowing them to operate at a higher capacity and respond rapidly during emergency situations. Considering both processes, process B would cause more oxygen and glucose to be directed to the muscles as it directly involves the secretion of adrenaline, which is responsible for preparing the body for physical exertion and emergencies by increasing oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

La Loi sur la citoyenneté canadienne est entrée en vigueur le 1er janvier 1947. Translate to English.","completion":"The Canadian Citizenship Act came into force on January 1, 1947. The Canadian Citizenship Act, also known as the Citizenship Act of 1946 or the Act of 1947, marked a significant milestone in the history of Canada and Canadian immigration. Prior to the enactment of this law, Canadian citizens were considered British subjects, and there was no unique Canadian citizenship. The Act aims to define Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it. The adoption of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947 was an important step towards Canada's evolution into an independent nation with its distinct national identity. The transition from British subject to Canadian citizen symbolized the country's growing autonomy from Great Britain. The Act established the criteria for obtaining Canadian citizenship, which included: 1. Birthright citizenship: Individuals born in Canada were automatically considered Canadian citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality. 2. Naturalization: Immigrants who had lived in Canada for a specific period (originally five years) could apply for Canadian citizenship. They had to demonstrate the knowledge of one of the two official languages (English or French), exhibit good character and understanding of Canadian rights and responsibilities, and pass a Citizenship exam. This made it more accessible to immigrants of various cultural and linguistic backgrounds. 3. Citizenship by descent: Children born to Canadian citizens outside of Canada could claim Canadian citizenship through their parental lineage. The Act also specified conditions under which an individual could lose their Canadian citizenship, such as fraud, revocation of naturalization, denaturalization, or through voluntary renunciation. Over the years, the Canadian Citizenship Act has gone through several amendments to address the changing needs and concerns of the Canadian population. Some of these revisions included the elimination of discriminatory clauses, the introduction of dual citizenship, the expansion of eligibility requirements, and the international adoption of children by Canadian citizens. Today, the Canadian Citizenship Act continues to serve as the foundation for defining Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it.

SSL methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently provided successful results on standard benchmark tasks such as image classification. In this work, we consider the general setting of SSL problem where the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same underlying probability distribution. We propose a new approach that adopts an Optimal Transport (OT) technique serving as a metric of similarity between discrete empirical probability measures to provide pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, which can then be used in conjunction with the initial labeled data to train the CNN model in an SSL manner.

Does every object have a lever arm? What is a lever arm (physics)? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Hello little buddy! Let's talk about lever arms. 1. Does every object have a lever arm? Every object doesn't exactly have a lever arm, but you can use a lever arm with almost any object. Let's say you want to lift a big rock. If you use a long stick and put it under the rock with one end on the ground, you can push down on the other end to lift the rock. The stick acts like a lever, and the distance from the rock to the end you push on is the lever arm. The longer the lever arm, the easier it is to lift the rock. 2. What is a lever arm (physics)? A lever arm is like a helper in physics. Think of a see-saw, where two kids sit on opposite ends and go up and down. The lever arm is the distance from the center (where the see-saw balances on) to where the kids sit. The longer the lever arm, the more help it gives to move something. Remember the lifting rock example? The long stick was like a see-saw, and the lever arm helped you lift the rock! 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? These questions are related but not the same. The first question asks if every object has a lever arm, while the second question asks for the meaning of a lever arm in physics. Now you know that objects don't have lever arms, but you can use lever arms with objects to make things easier to move!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She is married to Gordon Wink (Richard Steinmetz), a detective with the LAPD, with whom we see some flashbacks of their relationship. Fairfax (Charles M. Huber), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting Shakespeare, is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow \\"shift the balance of power in the world.\\" It is not in any way explained how these devices will achieve this, other than mention that it is involved with satellite tracking, that a whole city could be destroyed and a Third World country is in danger. Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices. Carrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfaxâs goons to the site of one of their exchanges. The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device. Carrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller). She takes them to the Zitex building, where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor. Somehow there seems to be very few people in the 86-floor building. He meets up with Cranston (Eugene Robert Glazer), the possessor of the fourth device. As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout. Before entering the building, Cranston had suspected trouble, so his companion went in unseen. Before he dies, Cranston escapes with the suitcase holding the device and meets up with Carrie, who helps him up to the roof. He gives her the suitcase and admonishes her...

Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Most flatworms have a distinct head region that includes nerve cells and sensory organs, such as eyespots. The development of a head region, called cephalization , evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals. This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have radial symmetry. Q: The development of a head region is called what? A: A:","completion":"The development of a head region in animals is called cephalization. This evolutionary process involves the concentration of nerve cells, sensory organs, and other important structures in the anterior (front) part of an organism, forming a distinct head region. Cephalization is closely associated with the emergence of bilateral symmetry, as it allows for more efficient movement and coordinated responses to environmental stimuli. In comparison, cnidarians, which evolved earlier than flatworms, do not exhibit cephalization; instead, they have radial symmetry, with body parts arranged symmetrically around a central axis. The presence of a head region, or cephalization, in flatworms and other bilaterally symmetric animals demonstrates an important step in the evolution of complex body plans and neurological systems. This concentration of neural and sensory components in the head region allows these animals to better process and respond to their surroundings, ultimately enhancing their survival and adaptability in various environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes, primarily Kermes vermilio. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from Porphyrophora hamelii (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What kind of bural was at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône?","completion":"The burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône was likely a Neolithic cave-burial, as indicated by the context in which the jars of Kermes dye were found. Cave burials, in general, were a type of interment in which the remains of the deceased were placed in natural or artificially excavated caves. These burials can either contain individual or multiple bodies, depending on the specific cultural practices of the people occupying the area. In this particular case, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the cave burial contained a single individual or multiple bodies. However, the discovery of Kermes dye within the burial site suggests that this substance held cultural significance and may have been associated with funeral rituals or used as an offering to the dead. Artifacts found within cave burial sites often provide valuable insights into the cultural practices, beliefs, and daily lives of Neolithic people. The Neolithic Period, during which the use of Kermes dye originated, is marked by significant developments in human society, including the beginnings of agriculture, animal domestication, and the construction of permanent dwelling structures. As such, we can surmise that the burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône, reflects a community with complex social structures and evolving cultural beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife. In summary, the burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône was a Neolithic cave burial, a type of interment where remains were placed in natural or artificially excavated caves. The specific characteristics of this burial, such as the number of individuals interred and further details about the rituals performed, are not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of Kermes dye within the site highlights the cultural importance of this substance during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tokyo (CNN) Under crisp blue skies, about 1,000 well-wishers turned out at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo Monday to catch a glimpse of Japan's Princess Ayako and her groom Kei Moriya on their wedding day. As the smiling couple entered the shrine, the crowd shouted their congratulations with the Japanese word \\"Banzai\\" -- meaning an auspicious wish for long life. Close family members and friends welcomed the bride and groom as they made their way to the ceremony hall. Princess Ayako was dressed in a light yellow-colored uchiki kimono embroidered with pink flowers and green leaves and a deep purple hakama -- wide-legged pleated trousers that fall to the ankles. She also carried a fan made of Japanese cypress, called a hiougi. Moriya wore a western-style black morning coat, gray pin-striped trousers and a silk hat that belonged to Ayako's late father, Prince Takamodo. Ayako's kimono is similar in style and design to that worn by her sister Princess Noriko when she married Kunimaro Senge in 2014. The 28-year-old Princess Ayako is the youngest child of Princess Hisako and the late Prince Takamodo, cousin of Emperor Akihito. According to Japan's imperial law, female members of the royal family forfeit their titles, status and allowance if they choose to marry someone who does not have royal or aristocratic family ties. The same rule does not apply to male members of the royal family. On marrying 32-year-old Moriya -- an employee of shipping company Nippon Yusen KK -- the princess will renounce her royal status and take a lump sum of 950,000 from the Japanese government for living expenses. Japanese Princess Ayako, dressed in traditional ceremonial gown, and Japanese businessman Kei Moriya, arrive at Meiji Shrine for their wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. Before the ceremony began, Ayako changed her kimono into a more formal Shinto-style robe. She wore a red kouchiki, a \\"small cloak\\" with long, wide sleeves, and a long divided brown skirt called a naga-bakama. The ceremony itself was a private affair, attended only by close family members. Inside, the couple would have performed several rituals that mark a Shinto-style wedding, including exchanging nuptial sake cups and presenting a sacred Tamagushi branch as an offering. The newlyweds would have also exchanged marriage vows and rings. After final prayers, the couple emerged from the shrine as husband and wife. Moriya said he thought his new wife looked \\"beautiful,\\" as they took questions from reporters. \\"I would like to support her firmly and, hand in hand, build a happy family with lots of laughter,\\" he said. \\"I am awed by how blessed I am,\\" Ayako said. From a young age, Ayako said she was taught that being born into the imperial family meant her duty was to support the emperor and empress. \\"I will leave the imperial family today, but I will remain unchanged in my support for his majesty and her majesty,\\" she said. Princess Ayako on her way to her wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. The shrine where the ceremony took place is of huge symbolic importance. Opened in 1920, the Meiji Shrine is dedicated to the deified souls of Ayako's great-great grandfather Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shoken. \\"I am very happy that we held the wedding at this Meiji Shrine where my great grandfather Meiji Emperor is worshiped,\\" Ayako said. \\"I feel so happy.\\" Ayoko's marriage and resignation from royal duties comes at a trying time for the world's oldest monarchy. The country's much-loved Emperor Akihitio announced that he will abdicate on April 30, 2019, passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his son Crown Prince Naruhito. Imperial law states that the throne must be passed to male heirs, and as Naruhito has only one son, the 12-year-old Prince Hisahito could be left with the sole responsibility of carrying on the royal line. Akihitio's abdication and the forthcoming marriage of his granddaughter Princess Mako reignited debate about the role women play in Japan's monarchy and whether imperial law should change to allow women to inherit the throne. Newlyweds Princess Ayako and Kei Moriya speak to the reporters after their marriage ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. \\"It is a sensible option and necessary in terms of managing risk but the elite conservatives that govern have resisted strongly despite robust public support for female succession,\\" said Jeff Kingston, Director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan and author of upcoming book Japan. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth approved changes to the royal line of succession and gave equal rights to sons and daughters of British monarchs to inherit the throne, officials in Japan have ruled out a similar move. An abdication law that allows Akihitio to resign was passed without a proposed resolution that potentially questions whether women who marry outside the family have to rescind their royal rights. \\"Apparently they take no inspiration from Queen Elizabeth ... and instead take refuge behind fatuous patriarchal justifications for not doing so,\\" Kingston said. \\"The law will change only if it absolutely must.\\" ||||| Japanese Princess Ayako, right, dressed in traditional ceremonial robe, and groom Kei Moriya, left, speak to the reporters after their wedding ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Monday, Oct. 29, 2018....

(Associated Press) TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Princess Ayako married a commoner in a ritual-filled ceremony Monday at Tokyo's Meiji Shrine. Ayako and groom Kei Moriya were shown on national news walking slowly before guests at the shrine. The wedding took place in one of the pagoda-like buildings in the shrine complex and included an exchange of rings and a sharing of a cup of sake, according to Japanese media. Both rituals are relatively routine for Shinto-style weddings, including those of regular Japanese. Ayako, 28, is the daughter of the emperor's cousin, and Moriya, 32, works for major shipping company Nippon Yusen. She wore a Heian-era style hairdo, which is swept back into a ponytail, and a traditional robe splashed with red and green patterns, while Moriya wore coattails. She later changed into a red Japanese robe. \\"I am filled with happiness,\\" she told reporters after the ceremony. Women who marry into the imperial family become members of the family, but those who marry commoners, like Ayako, must leave. Moriya said he hoped to help Ayako adjust to a commoner's life. \\"I want us to work together, hand in hand, to create a family filled with smiles,\\" he said. Ayako bid farewell to Emperor Akihito last week. She said Monday she hoped to continue to help the emperor and empress as a former member of the imperial family. The eldest granddaughter of the emperor is set to marry a commoner in 2020. Akihito has said he will abdicate next year. His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. Ayako and Moriya said when they announced their wedding plans that they met because their mothers were friends and hit it off immediately. \\"It didn't feel as though we had met for the first time,\\" Ayako told reporters at their engagement.

Question: Did Fielding and Sarah have political differences? Movie title: Waking the Dead Movie plot: The first scene of the movie introduces Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) as he is watching news footage showing that Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has been killed in a suspected car bombing. The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality. Fielding seems ambivalent about the offer to be put on the... Answer:","completion":"Yes, Fielding and Sarah had significant political differences throughout the movie plot of \\"Waking the Dead.\\" Fielding Pierce, portrayed by Billy Crudup, is an ambitious and aspiring politician with plans to one day become the president. His political ideals are more in line with the mainstream and upholding the status quo. He is seen pursuing a political career, initially being groomed to be a congressman by the current governor due to a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael (played by Ed Harris). On the other hand, Sarah Williams, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly, is a passionate activist from Chicago who dedicates her life to helping refugees from the Chilean government. Her political beliefs lean more towards challenging the system, and she is vocal about her support for the underprivileged and those fighting against oppressive regimes. An example of the couple's differences in political views is highlighted when Sarah expresses her support for the people opposing the Vietnam War, stating that if Fielding went to Vietnam, he would be shooting at the people she wants to win. Despite their stark differences in political beliefs, Fielding and Sarah find themselves attracted to and intrigued by each other. Their intense love and strong emotional connection overshadow their contrasting political views, and they quickly become involved in a deep, complicated relationship. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is important to weigh the potential market interest in a movie that delves into the complexities of a relationship amid the backdrop of contrasting political beliefs and ideals. While the storyline presents a unique combination of romance, politics, and personal growth, its success will depend upon the execution, talent involved, and the target audience's appreciation for such themes. Understanding the current market trends, the relevance of the subject matter, and how it might resonate with audiences will be crucial in making an informed decision about whether or not to invest in this film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was bitten by a monkey? from the following article ? By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Seymour.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind.

During inhalation, the air, which contains oxygen, is drawn into the body through the nostrils and/or the mouth, as it is essential for our cells to function properly and produce energy.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options: A. not enough information B. they will have an increased risk of disease C. they will enjoy their food more D. they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","completion":"B. they will have an increased risk of disease Step 1: Understand the context provided - The context talks about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and how it can contribute to a healthier aging process. It also mentions that the standard American diet is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, and processed food, which can be harmful to one's health. Step 2: Review the question - The question asks what will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries, which are examples of unhealthy food options. Step 3: Analyze the options - Option A, not enough information, can be eliminated because the context provides information about the consequences of unhealthy food choices. Option C, they will enjoy their food more, may be true but does not specifically address the long-term consequences of their food choices. Option D, they will be healthier than those who don't, is contradictory to the information provided in the context. Step 4: Choose the correct option - Based on the information from the context, option B, they will have an increased risk of disease, is the correct answer. This is because the context discusses how unhealthy food choices can increase the risk of health problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Another popular argument for affirmative action is the compensation argument. Blacks were mistreated in the past for a morally irrelevant characteristic of being black so society today should compensate for the injuries. This causes reverse discrimination in the form of preferential hirings, contracts, and scholarships as a means to ameliorate past wrongs. Many opponents argue that this form of reparation is morally indefensible because if blacks were harmed for being black in the past, then preferential treatment for this same trait is illogical. In addition, arguments are made that whites today who innocently benefited from past injustices should not be punished for something they had no control over. Therefore, they are being reverse discriminated against because they are receiving the punishment that should be given to people who willingly and knowingly benefited from discriminatory practices Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In the compensation argument, who should supposedly have to make up for past discrimination against blacks?","completion":"In the compensation argument for affirmative action, the responsibility to make up for past discrimination against blacks is generally placed on various entities involved in perpetuating or benefiting from past discriminatory practices. The justification for this approach is rooted in rectifying historical injustices and promoting social equity. Here, we will examine some stakeholders that may hold this compensatory responsibility: 1. Government: Since governments either promoted or failed to prevent discriminatory practices in the past, they hold a significant responsibility to make amends. Affirmative action policies instituted by governments at various levels can help in addressing historical imbalances. Examples include the establishment of quotas in educational institutions, preferential treatment in public sector hiring, and increased spending on social programs targeting disadvantaged groups. 2. Private institutions and businesses: Many private institutions and businesses benefited, either directly or indirectly, from past discriminatory practices against blacks. As a result, they hold some responsibility in addressing this issue. Companies could implement diversity hiring policies, create targeted scholarships and training programs, and establish partnerships with minority-owned businesses. 3. Society at large: Society as a whole played a role in perpetuating racial discrimination, so it can be argued that every member of society should contribute to remedying past wrongs. Educating individuals about historical injustices, fostering racial understanding, and encouraging open conversations about race can help achieve social equity. Additionally, supporting non-profit organizations working for racial justice can be a way for members of society to contribute. 4. Educational institutions: Schools and universities have a responsibility to promote diversity and address historical inequalities. They can do this by implementing affirmative action admission policies, offering targeted scholarships for underrepresented communities, and creating inclusive curricula to understand and appreciate various cultures and their histories. With regard to the concern of reverse discrimination, affirmative action policies ideally do not seek to punish innocent individuals who have unintentionally benefitted from past discrimination. Instead, the primary goal is to level the playing field for those who have faced historical disadvantages and to ensure equal opportunities for all. However, it is essential to maintain a balance in these policies to avoid unfairly disadvantaging any particular group. This requires constant monitoring and adjustment of affirmative action policies based on their effectiveness and fairness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although they both address the same situation and the hypothesis negates the possibility of conclusion, there is no direct logical connection between uncertainty and certainty.

Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Iron Man 2 Movie plot: The movie opens several months after the events in the first Iron Man movie. We are introduced to a man named Ivan Vanko. Ivan's father Anton is slowly dying and telling Ivan his final wishes. Ivan thinks he should have the fame that Tony Stark is enjoying but Anton tells him to \\"ignore that garbage.\\" All Anton can give Ivan is his knowledge. Ivan takes a blueprint that has his father's name on it, and also the name of Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father. Ivan then sets about recreating the Arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the \\"Stark Expo\\" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony's new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony's usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon. Colonel Rhodes presents the investigation into the events surrounding Iron Man's creation, but Senator Stern, the committee chairman, takes his remarks out of context. Tony gives a rebuttal showing that... My question: Who is the Iron Man?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes? ? Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of... A:","completion":"The specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes in the given article is \\"angels.\\" These angels form circles around the heavenly figures, creating a sense of harmony and unity in the composition. The artist, Lochner, employs these stylistic elements, such as circular shapes and haloes, to enhance the visual appeal and draw the viewer into the scene, ultimately leading to a feeling of empathy with the revolving forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The music for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series was primarily composed by renowned German composer Hans Zimmer, with contributions from other composers and music producers such as Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and Rodrigo y Gabriela. The series, which comprises five installments so far, features individual scores for each movie. The first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), had its soundtrack composed by Klaus Badelt, with Hans Zimmer serving as a score producer and contributing some themes. This score has been recognized for its memorable and iconic themes, most notably \\"He's a Pirate,\\" which became the main theme of the entire series. For the second and third installments, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Hans Zimmer took over as the primary composer. These scores included several well-known themes such as \\"Davy Jones,\\" \\"The Kraken,\\" and \\"One Day.\\" Zimmer maintained the unique sound from the first film while developing the music further to suit the evolving storylines and characters. Zimmer continued his work on the series with the fourth installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). For this film, Zimmer collaborated with acclaimed Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela to create a distinct sound that blended classical orchestral elements with traditional Latin American and Spanish guitar. The soundtrack includes cues like \\"Angelica\\" and \\"Blackbeard\\" which added to the rich musical tapestry in the series. In the fifth and most recent film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), Zimmer passed on the compositional baton to his long-time collaborator, Geoff Zanelli. Zanelli had worked with Zimmer on all previous installments as a member of Zimmer's team. While he composed the original score for this movie, Zanelli built upon and incorporated some of the themes created by Zimmer and Badelt, maintaining the characteristic musical atmosphere tied to the series. In summary, the music for Pirates of the Caribbean primarily comes from the creative genius of Hans Zimmer, with vital contributions from Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and the guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela. The iconic music from the series is cherished for its adventurous, swashbuckling, and action-packed sound that perfectly complements the films' legendary pirate tales."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What album featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts? After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous. What was the emperor's rule in Rome?","completion":"In ancient Rome, the emperor's rule was acknowledged as divinely approved and constitutional through state cult to a living emperor.

As more people continue to notice the shift, the online debate becomes heated, with users expressing their opinions on various platforms. Twitter users are split into two camps - the \\"traditionalists\\" who strongly believe that Twitter should maintain its original features and characteristics, and the \\"innovators\\" who think that mixing features borrowed from other platforms can drive user engagement and growth. The debate on Twitter and other websites eventually catches the attention of major news outlets and tech blogs who begin covering the story. Meanwhile, Victoria Woollaston picks up on the response and curates an article about the ongoing debate. Her piece highlights various tweets and posts from both sides of the argument, showing the depth of the controversy. The article generates more buzz, leading people to express opinions on what separates Twitter from Facebook and how the platform should evolve. The resulting immense pressure on Twitter eventually forces the company to listen to its users' concerns. Twitter decides to conduct a poll to seek user input on whether to revert to the classic 'Retweet' button or stick with the new 'Share with followers' option. Users express a strong preference for the traditional 'Retweet,' leading Twitter to announce that they will be bringing back the beloved icon. After a few weeks, Twitter rolls back the update and reinstates the 'Retweet' button. The move is praised by the majority of users who value the platform's unique identity. However, a small group of innovators is unhappy with the decision and forms a Twitter-based community to brainstorm and discuss ideas about possible future changes to the platform. Ultimately, Twitter learns a valuable lesson about preserving its identity and balancing it with user feedback when implementing new features. The traditionalists celebrate the decision, while the innovators continue to work on ways to enhance the user experience on the platform.

Please answer this question: Lewis Hamilton was born in which home counties town?","completion":"Lewis Hamilton, the highly successful British Formula One racing driver, was born in Stevenage, a town located in the home county of Hertfordshire, England. Stevenage is situated to the east of junctions 7 and 8 of the A1(M), and is located between Letchworth Garden City to the north, and Welwyn Garden City to the south. It is known for its fast intercity train links provided by the East Coast Main Line and has a blend of a modern town centre and the historic Old Town. Hamilton was born on January 7, 1985, to Carmen Larbalestier and Anthony Hamilton. As a child, Hamilton quickly showed his prowess for racing, famously approaching McLaren team principal, Ron Dennis, at the Autosport Awards ceremony at the age of 10 and telling him, \\"I want to race for you one day...I want to race for McLaren.\\" Only three years later, McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to their Young Driver Support Programme. Hamilton's early years in Stevenage were marked with a strong interest and participations in car racing. He began his racing career at Rye House Kart Circuit and rapidly ascended up the ranks of motorsport from there. His precocious talent and relentless determination brought him to the apex of his sport, becoming one of the World Champions in Formula One with an astounding record. He has proven himself as one of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport and has carved out a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. His success brought a great deal of pride to his hometown, and he has been quoted saying that his upbringing in Stevenage played a huge role in his success as it taught him to \\"aim higher\\". Despite now living in Monaco, Hamilton often speaks affectionately of the town where he was born and raised. His story is a testament to the fact that talent, drive and determination can come from anywhere, even a quiet town in the home counties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Will Bernie supporters withhold their vote for Clinton even though that helps Trump? Will Bernie Sanders supporters support Clinton or withhold their vote? What percentage of them will vote for Clinton? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To provide answers to both questions and analyze their similarity, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Understand the context and background of the questions Both questions are related to the 2016 US Presidential election. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were both running for the Democratic nomination, while Donald Trump was the Republican candidate. The questions are concerned about the voting behavior of Bernie Sanders supporters if Clinton secures the Democratic nomination. Step 2: Analyze the first question \\"Will Bernie supporters withhold their vote for Clinton even though that helps Trump?\\" This question asks whether Bernie Sanders supporters would not vote for Clinton in the general election, even if it might increase Trump's chances of winning. Step 3: Analyze the second question \\"Will Bernie Sanders supporters support Clinton or withhold their vote? What percentage of them will vote for Clinton?\\" This question is similar to the first one, asking whether Bernie Sanders supporters would vote for Clinton or not. Additionally, it also asks what percentage of them might vote for Clinton. Step 4: Determine similarity between the two questions Both questions ask whether Bernie Sanders supporters would choose to vote for Hillary Clinton or not. However, the second question provides an additional layer of specificity by asking for a percentage of supporters who would vote for Clinton. The first question mentions the potential impact of not voting for Clinton (i.e., it could help Trump win). This context is not explicitly present in the second question but is related. Conclusion: The two questions are not exact paraphrases of each other, but they are related and have significant overlap. The first question provides an implication of not voting for Clinton (helping Trump), while the second question seeks a specific percentage of Bernie Sanders supporters who would vote for Clinton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The group, known as 'The Global Emancipators,' conspires to create a hidden underwater cache of nuclear warheads, intending to use them to threaten the world's governments into submission. CIA intelligence reports reveal a top-secret message sent by a rogue US government operative named Houghton. The message indicates that Houghton has sent an American submarine named 'USS Poseidon' to deliver the last piece of the puzzle to The Global Emancipators - a state-of-the-art control chip that would enable the separatists to launch the nuclear warheads remotely. The US government assembles a highly skilled and diverse team of Navy SEALs and intelligence operatives to foil this plot. The mission, known as 'Operation Crimson Tide,' involves an underwater infiltration and the recovery of the submarine and its potentially devastating cargo. The team is tasked with boarding the USS Poseidon and retrieving the control chip while, at the same time, neutralizing the onboard threat - including the notorious operative Houghton. The team, led by Commander James Carter, embarks on the treacherous mission. As they near the submarine, they discover that the situation is more complex than initially anticipated. In addition to The Global Emancipators, there is also a rogue Russian faction called the Red Wolves involved - aiming to hijack the submarine for their endgame. While the team successfully infiltrates the submarine, they find themselves in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Houghton, The Global Emancipators, and the Red Wolves. Trust is tested in a series of intense battles and psychological warfare, as the mission's stakes grow ever higher. Members of the team start to doubt the extent of their loyalties, creating tensions within the group. As the race to secure the control chip and avert a global catastrophe intensifies, Houghton's true motivations come to light - he is a double agent, secretly working to sabotage The Global Emancipators and Red Wolves from within. Houghton sends a cryptic message to Commander Carter, offering a plan to not only save the world from mass destruction but to dismantle both extremist groups in the process. In a nerve-wracking climax, the team faces off against the enemies in an underwater battle royal, successfully recovering the chip. However, devastating sacrifices must be made, and not everyone makes it back to the surface alive. The Houghton Assignment is a thrilling, action-packed story that combines elements of military, espionage, and psychological drama. It highlights themes of loyalty, trust, and the personal costs of heroism, all within an intricate plot that keeps the audience guessing until the very end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write an article that answers the following question: When did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant?","completion":"Title: The Life of Zia'eddin Tabatabaee: From Small Beginnings to Serving Others Once upon a time, in a faraway land called Iran, there was a man named Zia'eddin Tabatabaee. He was an important person who helped take care of a big group of people called the members of the Majlis. The Majlis was like a big team of people who made decisions for the country. One day, Zia'eddin changed his job and started helping people in a new way. We call becoming this kind of helper a \\"servant\\". So when did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant? To answer this question, let's look back in time to when Zia'eddin was born. He came into this big world on February 3, 1889. He was a very smart kid, and he grew up learning a lot in school. Eventually, he became a wise and important grown-up who helped make big decisions for Iran. Zia'eddin Tabatabaee had many different jobs in his life. For example, he was a journalist, which means he wrote articles, just like this one! He also taught others important knowledge that he learned. But when did Zia'eddin become a servant to help people? It was around 1910 when Zia'eddin started a newspaper called Nowbahar. This is when many people say he changed into a servant, because he started using his new job and his writing skills to help the people of Iran. He wrote about the things that mattered to the people so they could understand what was going on in their country. Let's fast forward to 1925. This was another important time in Zia'eddin Tabatabaee's life. He was chosen to be someone very important, called the Prime Minister of Iran. This meant that he was in charge of helping the people and making decisions for the whole country. Some people say Zia'eddin Tabatabaee really became a servant when he stepped up as Prime Minister because he took on a bigger responsibility to serve and protect his people. But it was when he was a journalist that he first started to help people by writing about important things and sharing important information. So, we could say that Zia'eddin Tabatabaee became a servant around 1910 when he started his newspaper, Nowbahar. In conclusion, Zia'eddin Tabatabaee was a very important man who helped his country in different ways. Though we might not know for sure the exact moment when he became a servant, we do know that he started helping others from early on in life. And as he grew up and took on bigger and bigger jobs, he continued to be a helper and a servant to the people of Iran."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy? from the following article ? Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Certainly lives down to its title, which sounds like a caveman giving travel advice. 4. the proverbial sound and fury, filled with typical Asian action film gravitas yet signifying nothing.

Couldn't the Pangs have spent some of that studio money on more lights? 7. All it proves is that on their home turf the Pangs can make an international hit-man tale every bit as trashy and dull as the ones made in Hollywood or Europe. 8.

I hope we don't read about him flat-lining on the commode, face down in the \\"Ghost Rider 3\\" script. 9. Bangkok Dangerous pretends to have a lot on its mind. It moves slow as molasses and has the same general coloring. 10.

The general consensus is that the film is watchable but lacks the charm and excitement of the original. Cage, who is usually a talented actor, is viewed as wasting his time in this seemingly lackluster endeavor. The film's title is mocked as uninteresting, with comparisons to cavemen giving travel advice. Additionally, the movie is said to be filled with sound and fury but ultimately signifying nothing, pointing to its disappointing and unengaging nature. Cage's character, a contract killer, is made fun of for his poor hairstyle, while the film's production is criticized for its low budget and poor lighting choices. The Pangs, the film's creators, are seen as having failed in their attempt to create a thrilling international hit-man tale, as reviewers found it to be just as trashy and dull as similar stories from Hollywood and Europe. Cage's involvement in \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is likened to the unfortunate downfall of Elvis Presley, foreshadowing possible grim consequences for Cage's career. In summary, \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is seen as a stylish yet slow and laborious thriller that lacks the excitement and engagement one would expect from such a film.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion.

Zibo is a renowned prefecture-level city in central Shandong province in eastern China. Shandong province, known for its significant historical and cultural heritage, is located on the eastern coast of China, bordering the Yellow Sea. Zibo, as a crucial city in this province, is recognized for its booming industries, including the production of ceramics and glass. Additionally, it is known for being rich in natural resources, particularly coal and iron, playing a crucial role in the economic development of Shandong province. The city of Zibo is divided into several districts, each with its own unique characteristics and strengths. As a whole, Zibo has a robust economic infrastructure. It is also home to several tourist attractions, such as the Zhoucun Ancient City, Zibo Chinese Ceramics Museum, Zibo Museum, and Mount Tai, offering rich experiences in history, culture, and art. On the other hand, Huaiyin District of Huai'an is located in the Jiangsu province, which is situated to the south of Shandong province where Zibo is located. Similar to Shandong, Jiangsu province possesses a distinct historical and cultural heritage but is universally recognized for its prosperity and well developed higher education and research institutions. Huaiyin District in the city of Huai'an, like Zibo, is an economic hub with a vast industrial park and numerous companies contributing to Jiangsu's economy. The district is famous for its abundant water resources, being surrounded by lakes and canals, resulting in fertile land perfect for agriculture. Huai'an, and notably Huaiyin District, is also known as the birthplace of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, adding to its historical significance.

Many visually-impaired individuals automatically assume there is no place for them in the workplace due to their affliction. Fortunately, this is absolutely not the case. Before you even start sending out resumes, it's a good idea to nurture a positive attitude. Stamp out negative thoughts, and replace them with something positive. For example, if you find yourself thinking something like \\"I'll never find a job. No one will ever hire me because I'm blind,\\" replace the thought with something constructive: \\"I may be blind, sure, but it doesn't stop me from being a worthwhile and valuable human being.\\" In many ways, living in today's society comes with the expectation that you have full use of your eyes. If this isn't the case with you, it can be easy to feel hopeless about one's situation. However, the vast majority of modern professions are available for the visually-impaired to pursue. You should never let yourself get down. Being visually impaired may be tough in many situations, but if you take a moment to look, you'll find hundreds of success stories of people who have gone on to do great things in spite of their disability. Many of these success stories end up using their disability as a motivator to excel in other ways. Never let a disability keep you from doing what you are capable of. People with visual impairment are sometimes stigmatized in the workplace. However, anti-discrimination laws have made it so that it's never been easier to find work as a blind person. Mid-size and larger corporations are often offered incentives to hire the legally blind and visually impaired. Although you'll still need to have the other skills in order to be hired, you should never see your disability as an obstacle with the vast majority of jobs. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was enacted to help ensure equal opportunities for people with disabilities. Depending on the country you're currently residing in, there should be similar laws passed to make it easier for you to find work. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how blind people might have trouble finding a job because they feel bad about themselves and think they can't do the work. But the truth is, they can do a lot of jobs just like everyone else! There are even special laws to help them find work and make sure they are treated fairly. So, it's important for blind people to think positively and remember they are valuable just like everyone else."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

An Ohio distributor is recalling about 6 million Chinese-made tire valve stems after concluding that some of them were improperly made and could increase the risk of accidents. An Ohio distributor is recalling 6 million Chinese-made car tire valve stems. Tech International, the part's Johnstown, Ohio-based distributor, estimates that just 8,600 of roughly 6 million of those valves are defective. The valve is a replacement snap-in tire valve -- Model No. TR413 -- manufactured between July and November 2006. It was imported by Tech International from manufacturer Shanghai Baolong Industries Co. in Shanghai, China, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Continuing to drive on underinflated tires can cause them to burst, possibly leading to crashes. Tech International told the NHTSA that the company doesn't have records of the final purchasers of the valve stems. According to the company, the defect was identified after \\"a small number\\" of the valves were reported by customers and one distributor to have failed.

Please answer this question: Someone who has an abnormal fear of dogs is suffering from what?","completion":"Someone who has an abnormal fear of dogs is suffering from a specific phobia known as cynophobia. The term cynophobia originates from the Greek words \\"Kyón\\" and \\"Phóbos,\\" which mean \\"dog\\" and \\"fear\\" respectively. Cynophobia is classified under \\"specific phobias,\\" a category defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a diagnostic reference book used by clinicians and psychiatrists. Cynophobia, like other specific phobias, is characterized by an excessive and irrational fear towards a specific situation, object, or animal-in this case, dogs. People suffering from cynophobia experience extreme anxiety or panic attacks at the sight of dogs, the thought of getting close to dogs, or even the mere mention or depiction of dogs. The fear is so intense that the person goes out of their way to avoid dogs or anything associated with dogs. Several factors can lead one to develop cynophobia. It could be due to a traumatic experience in the past involving dogs, such as being bitten or attacked, or witnessing someone else being harmed by a dog. Such traumatic incidents may imprint a fear in the person's mind, causing an automatic fear response whenever they encounter dogs. Even hearing about these incidents second-hand or watching traumatic scenes involving dogs on TV can potentially trigger cynophobia. Cynophobia may also be learned behavior. Children can inherit fears and phobias from their parents or other adult role models through observational learning. If a child sees their parent showing fear of dogs, they may adopt the same fear, believing that dogs are something to be afraid of. Genetic factors may also play a significant role. Some people might be genetically disposed to anxiety disorders, including phobias. If a person has family members suffering from any kind of phobia, they may be at a higher risk of developing a phobia themselves. The symptoms of cynophobia can vary based on the person's level of fear. Physical responses can include sweating, rapid heart rate, trembling, dry mouth, nausea, or having trouble breathing. Behavioral responses can include an earnest effort to avoid areas where dogs might be present, even if it disrupts their regular routine. Psychological symptoms may include intense fear, panic, dread, or terror. They might also experience anticipatory anxiety, where they feel anxious even thinking about coming in contact with a dog. Treatment for cynophobia, as with other specific phobias, can be conducted through various therapeutic interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly used, where the person learns how to manage their fear responses and change their thought patterns regarding dogs. Exposure therapy can also be helpful, where they are gradually and repeatedly exposed to dogs (or images and sounds related to dogs) in a safe environment, to extinguish the fear response. In severe cases, medication might also be considered to manage acute symptoms of anxiety, although it won't cure the phobia itself. In conclusion, cynophobia is a specific type of phobia where one has an intense and irrational fear of dogs. Not all people who fear dogs suffer from cynophobia as the fear has to be extreme and interfere with their daily life, causing intense distress. It's essential to remember that people with this condition aren't just afraid of dogs; their fear is deeply rooted, often linked to past trauma, and can greatly impact their quality of life. Treatment can be very effective, so seeking help from a healthcare professional is crucial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries of nature. Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car.

Help as much as you can. This article: George Frideric Handel was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear?, what is it ?","completion":"The last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear is Handel."},{"prompt":"Information: - Megacorporation, or megacorp, a term popularized by William Gibson, derives from the combination of the prefix \\"mega-\\" with the word \\"corporation\\". It has become widespread in cyberpunk literature. It refers to a corporation (normally fictional) that is a massive conglomerate, holding monopolistic or near-monopolistic control over multiple markets (thus exhibiting both a horizontal and a vertical monopoly). Megacorps are so powerful that they can ignore the law, possess their own heavily armed (often military-sized) private armies, hold \\"sovereign\\" territory, and even act as outright governments. They often exercise a large degree of control over their employees, taking the idea of \\"corporate culture\\" to an extreme. Such organizations as a staple of science fiction long predate cyberpunk, appearing in the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick (\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", 1968), Thea von Harbou (\\"Metropolis\\", 1927), Robert A. Heinlein (\\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\", 1957), Robert Asprin (\\"The Cold Cash War\\", 1977), Andre Norton (the \\"Solar Queen\\" novels) and David Weber (\\"the \\"Honorverse\\" novels). - , abbreviated as media (and sometimes as OAV, original animated video), are animated films and series made specially for release in home video formats without prior showings on television or in theatres, though the first part of an OVA series may be broadcast for promotional purposes.

The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor.

These preparations may contain a combination of milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and other essential ingredients. The resulting product, known as milk crumb, is often an intermediate step in producing milk chocolate that has a consistent texture and a rich, pleasing taste. The request for packings of greater than 2 kg suggests that this product is intended for industrial or large-scale use. Bulk packaging in larger quantities is beneficial for chocolate manufacturers and businesses that produce significant amounts of milk chocolate. Some advantages of purchasing milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg include: 1. Cost-effective: Purchasing chocolate milk crumb preparations in bulk can significantly lower the price per kilogram, allowing manufacturers to save money on production costs. 2. Consistent quality: Purchasing a large package of chocolate milk crumb helps ensure consistent quality across different batches, leading to a more uniform final product. 3. Efficient production: Having a larger package of milk crumb on hand enables the chocolate manufacturer to produce more batches without having to reorder the product frequently, ultimately enhancing production efficiency. 4. Storage convenience: Chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of more than 2 kg are usually vacuum-packed or packed in moisture-proof bags or containers, protecting the product from humidity and contamination. This packaging format ensures that the product will be safely stored until it is needed. 5. Sustainability: Using larger packages can also help minimize waste by reducing the amount of packaging materials required for smaller quantities, which is beneficial for both the environment and cost reduction.

Mixing and blending ingredients: Milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and any additional ingredients are blended together to create a uniform mixture. The specific ratios of the components may vary depending on the desired final product. 2. Heating and caramelization: The blended mixture is heated in a controlled environment, which allows the sugar to caramelize and react with the milk proteins. This process develops the desired flavor and aroma of the milk crumb. 3. Cooling and pulverizing: The resulting caramelized mixture is cooled and then processed into small crumbs using specialized equipment. This step prepares the milk crumb for incorporation into chocolate products. 4. Packaging: The milk crumb is weighed and packaged into appropriate quantities greater than 2 kg, ensuring it is properly sealed to preserve its freshness and quality. By following these general guidelines, chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg can be efficiently produced and distributed to chocolate manufacturers, ultimately contributing to the creation of delicious milk chocolate products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Find a word with meaning to you. Use a pop culture or literary reference. Get inspiration from common products or things. Pick a random name. Use your own name (or your initials). Make up a new word.","completion":"Title: From Life's Ordinary to the Extraordinary: Discovering Personalized Words with Profound Meaning Introduction: In the age of digital communication and constant exchange of information, it can seem like all the words we use have lost their spark and value. They fade into the background of our daily lives, passing by almost unnoticed. But what if we could find or create words that truly resonate with us, that hold inherent meaning and can act as a representation of who we are? From pop culture and literary references to random names and even our own initials, there is a world of inspiration out there waiting to be untapped. Let's explore how! Step 1: Drawing from Pop Culture or Literary References A great starting point for discovering words that carry personal meaning is to reflect on the pop culture and literary references that have profoundly impacted your life. Whether it was a spellbinding movie, a thought-provoking book or even a catchy song, think past the surface and dive into the deeper symbolism and significance of those works. As you do, you're likely to find special words and phrases that reach beyond their original context and strike a chord with your own beliefs and experiences. Step 2: Seeking Inspiration from Common Products or Things It may sound unconventional, but taking a closer look at the products and items that surround us daily can open up a trove of potential words. The names or labels of everyday objects often contain interesting or lesser-known terms, which can be repurposed or combined to create a truly unique word. By doing so, you can inject creativity into your language, imbuing even mundane items with new and exciting layers of meaning. Step 3: Picking a Random Name Sometimes, the simplest solution can be the most rewarding. When all else fails, taking a leap into the unknown by selecting a random name or word generator can be the catalyst for finding a word that holds profound personal significance. Give destiny a chance – let the universe guide you toward an unexpected gem that you connect with on an emotional and intellectual level. Step 4: Embracing Your Own Name or Initials Our own names and initials are deeply tied to our identity and can serve as a source of inspiration for finding a word that truly represents us. By taking a closer look at the components of your name and its history, or by blending your initials into a single, harmonious expression, you can leverage your own background and experiences to create a word imbibed with your essence. Step 5: Inventing a New Word Ultimately, the search for a distinctive and meaningful word may lead you to the ultimate act of creativity: inventing a brand new word from scratch. The process may require careful thought, self-analyzing, and consideration of etymology to ensure it fulfills the criteria of representing who you are. But, the end result will be a linguistic embodiment of your personality, values, and aspirations – a custom-made word that serves as an extension of your identity. Conclusion: In a world full of words, it's easy to let them lose their magic. But by opening your mind to the possibilities and taking inspiration from every facet of life, you can rediscover the power of language and find (or create) words imbued with personal meaning. Be it a pop culture reference, random name, or a word of your own making, allow these words to serve as a testament to your uniqueness and the beauty of self-expression."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Possible answers: a). remorseful; b). be ignored by friends; c). be given a party; Q: Aubrey sent text messages to all of her friends telling them she was leaving. Given the context: What will happen to Aubrey? A:","completion":"Given the context provided, it is not possible to definitively predict the outcome for Aubrey after sending the text message. However, I can present an analysis of the possible scenarios listed, and evaluate the likelihood of each one based on typical human behavior and response patterns. a) Remorseful: There is a possibility that Aubrey may feel remorseful after sending the text messages. Remorse is a feeling of regret or guilt that may arise from realizing that an action might have had negative consequences. If Aubrey is someone who tends to feel guilty or concerned about the potential negative impact of her actions on others, she may be more likely to experience remorse in this situation. Factors that may contribute to Aubrey feeling remorseful could include her reasoning for leaving, the emotional connection she shares with her friends, and her past experiences in similar situations. b) Be ignored by friends: Aubrey's friends may choose to ignore her after receiving the text messages. This response may be a result of them feeling hurt, shocked, or betrayed by Aubrey's decision to leave. Depending on the relationships Aubrey shares with her friends, the bond between them, and whether they could have sensed or anticipated Aubrey's departure, the decision to ignore her may be perceived as justified or unreasonable by her friends. However, this response may not be permanent, as some friends might need time to process the new situation or confront their own feelings before reaching out to Aubrey for dialogue or closure. c) Be given a party: In some cases, Aubrey's friends might decide to throw her a farewell party. This would typically happen if her friends empathize with her reasons for leaving and wish to show their appreciation and support for her. Organizing a party for Aubrey would demonstrate the strength of their bond, as well as their understanding of her situation. Factors that could influence the decision to host a party for Aubrey might include the quality of her friendships, the reasons for her departure, and her friends' willingness to cherish the positive aspects of their relationships. In conclusion, the nature of Aubrey's relationships with her friends, her motive for leaving, and her friends' reactions and emotions contribute significantly to forecasting the most probable outcome. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine with certainty which scenario would play out for Aubrey. Each of the options presented — feelings of remorse, being ignored by friends, or being given a party — has potential connections to different circumstances and relationship dynamics."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes. Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip. - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805. - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, \\"Orchids, The Bulletin of the American Orchid Society.\\" The society's website American Orchid Society website has the answer to all questions orchid, including helpful, reliable information on how to grow your orchids. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. - Colmanara, abbreviated Colm. in the horticultural trade, is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids between the orchid genera \\"Miltonia\\", \\"Odontoglossum\\" and \\"Oncidium\\" (Milt. x Odm. x Onc.). - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences. - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids. - Odontocidium , abbreviated as Odcdm . in the horticultural trade , is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids of the two orchid genera Odontoglossum and Oncidium ( Odm . x Onc . ) . Many orchids formerly classified as Colmanara have been reclassified as Odontocidium by the American Orchid Society . - Oncidium altissimum, Wydler's dancing-lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to the West Indies (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles), with an 18th-Century citation from Jamaica. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world.

Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, focused on the period when more people settled down in cities. This conclusion can be drawn from the hint provided, which states that human beings invented agriculture around 10,000 years ago. The development of agriculture was a significant turning point in human history, as it led to a stable and reliable food supply. This allowed people to transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more settled way of life, as the practice of farming led to the establishment of permanent villages and eventually cities. Since Brad studied much earlier ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago, the evidence suggests that greater urbanization was not yet a feature of human society during that time. His research would have centered primarily on the lifestyle and practices of early human populations that were still reliant on hunting and gathering for their sustenance. With the advent of agriculture, human societies experienced changes in their birth and death rates. The accessibility to more food and the benefits of a settled life led to increased birth rates. However, the growth of dense human settlements resulted in the spread of diseases, often transmitted from domestic animals, which contributed to higher death rates as well. Despite the rise in both birth and death rates, overall population growth remained slow, but more people began to settle in villages and cities. In conclusion, Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, researched the period when more people began to settle down in cities, following the invention of agriculture."},{"prompt":"Given this review: \\"Its ok\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Maybe"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking? Why do so many people think dolls are creepy? Possible answers: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"The answer is (1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking?\\" is inquiring about a specific human behavior which is often unintentional. It is asking about the reasons why people might shake their leg when they're not consciously controlling their movement, or when they are deep in thought. The question would likely be answered with explanations about habits, cognitive processes, or possibly even neurological responses. The possible underlying reasons could be due to restless leg syndrome - a neurological disorder that creates an irresistible urge to move the legs, or it could be a subconscious mechanism for releasing nervous energy or stress. Furthermore, leg shaking could be a kind of stimming behavior - repetitive movements that some individuals use for self-stimulation, which is often common in people with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD or Autism. The second question, \\"Why do so many people think dolls are creepy?\\" is looking for answers about a largely psychological response to a specific object, namely dolls. It's delving into the area of phobias, fears and, more specifically, an aspect of culture known as uncanny or eerie feelings. What the question essentially asks is why dolls, objects meant for amusement, manage to inspire feelings of fear and discomfort in many people. Dolls can often create what is called an 'uncanny valley' effect - they look human, but not convincingly so, which can cause a sense of unease or discomfort. One theory from the discipline of psychology suggests that this reaction could be a primitive defensive mechanism: humans have evolved to recognize and react with alarm to things that look similar to us but are \\"off\\" in some way as they could indicate illness or danger. In conclusion, while both questions are centered on understanding human behaviors and responses, they are significantly different in focus. One is about physical, often unconscious action (shaking legs), and the other is about emotional and psychological reactions to inanimate objects (dolls). The apprehension to 'creepy' dolls is more psychological and influences our emotion, while the act of shaking legs usually is a physical reaction to various internal and external stimuli."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","completion":"The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Christian denomination that observes the Sabbath on Saturday, following the biblical example of seventh-day rest as described in the Holy Bible. This religious group upholds the belief that Saturday, the seventh day of the week according to the Gregorian calendar, should be observed as the day of rest and worship, rather than Sunday. The origin of the Seventh-day Adventist Church can be traced back to the Millerite movement in the United States during the early 19th century. The movement was named after its leader William Miller, a Baptist preacher who predicted the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, based on his interpretation of the prophecies in the Book of Daniel. When Miller's predictions failed, the event known as the \\"Great Disappointment\\" ensued, causing disillusionment among his followers. However, several groups emerged from the ashes of the Millerite movement, and one of them became the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Officially established in 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church not only observes the Sabbath on Saturday but also emphasizes other key beliefs, such as the imminent return of Jesus Christ, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and adherence to the teachings of the Bible. They follow the Ten Commandments, with a particular focus on the fourth commandment, which states the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, sanctified by God in the book of Genesis after he created the world in six days. The practice of Saturday Sabbath observance by the Seventh-day Adventist Church is rooted in the early Christian Church's tradition, which observed the Sabbath as per Jewish custom. However, the majority of Christianity shifted to Sunday observance under the influence of the Roman Empire and its traditions. The Seventh-day Adventist Church continued with the practice of the original Sabbath observance as they believe that it is a direct commandment from God. Today, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is a large international community with millions of members across the globe. They are known for their commitment to education, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, as well as their dedication to evangelism and sharing their beliefs with others. Their practice of observing the Sabbath on Saturday underscores their devotion to adhering to what they believe are the original teachings of the Bible and God's plan for his followers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: You and your ex will need to handle logistical details like canceling the venue rental, the entertainment, the flowers and décor, the cake and the honeymoon plans. Because of the strong emotional fallout after the wedding, you might ask family and close friends to assist you in handling these matters. Regardless, the burden for cancelling everything and retrieving deposits (if possible) should be shared by the would-be bride and groom. Once the wedding has been fully cancelled, you and your ex need to discuss what will happen to the engagement ring. This decision varies among couples. The general rule of thumb is whoever decided to call off the wedding didn’t hold up their end of the bargain, and therefore, doesn’t get the ring. One exception to this rule involves rings of extraordinary value or family heirlooms. In such cases, the ring should be returned to the family it belongs to. If your home is surrounded with reminders of your failed engagement and wedding (if not relationship), put them away - at least for the time being. Ask friends to help you toss out any wedding-related items such as invitations. Donate any wedding decor that could be used for other events, or try to resell them to recoup costs. If the failed engagement also brings the end of the relationship (NOT necessarily!), then cutting the entire thing out of your life would be cutting a part of yourself out - rather, put it away so that it is out of sight, out of mind.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is \\"inhaling or taking a breath.\\" This step is crucial as it initiates the respiratory system by drawing in oxygen-rich air from the environment into your lungs. The detailed and long answer to the entire process is as follows: 1. Inhaling or taking a breath: The process of respiration begins when you inhale oxygen-rich air from the environment. The act of breathing relies on the movement of your diaphragm, a large dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. When the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, it creates a partial vacuum in the chest cavity which allows air to be sucked into your lungs. 2. Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli: After entering your lungs, the air travels through a complex system of passageways called bronchi and bronchioles, which further divide into smaller branches. These passageways eventually lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are crucial for gas exchange as they have thin walls and a large surface area, making it easier for the oxygen to pass through and into your bloodstream. 3. Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries: As the oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, it encounters a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. These capillaries are in close contact with the walls of the alveoli, making it possible for efficient gas exchange to occur. The oxygen molecules diffuse from the air in the alveoli and pass through the walls of the alveoli into the nearby capillaries. 4. The oxygen goes into the bloodstream: Once inside the capillaries, the oxygen molecules bind to a protein called hemoglobin, found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body - a process known as oxygenation. The oxygen-rich blood now flows from the capillaries and into larger blood vessels called veins, which carry the blood back to the heart. 5. Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up: As the oxygen-rich blood circulates throughout your body, the oxygen molecules are delivered to your cells, where they participate in cellular respiration to produce energy needed for various bodily functions. During this process, cells consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. Carbon dioxide then diffuses from the cells and into the surrounding capillaries. 6. You breathe it out through your lungs: The carbon dioxide-rich blood is carried by veins back to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs. In the lungs, the carbon dioxide molecules pass from the capillaries into the alveoli by diffusion, essentially reversing the earlier process of oxygen crossing the walls of the alveoli. As you exhale, the carbon dioxide exits your body, and the process begins anew as you take another breath, inhaling oxygen-rich air to maintain the continuous and vital process of respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A dinosaur from the Middle-Late Jurassic period, found in China, gives scientists new understandings of how birds evolved, according to a Wednesday report from the journal Nature. The newly discovered species is called Aurornis xui. \\"Aurora\\" is Latin for \\"daybreak\\" or \\"dawn.\\" Ornis is Greek for \\"bird.\\" The last part of the name, xui, honors paleontologist Xu Xing. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Pascal Godefroit, lead author and researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. Read about more dinosaur discoveries The critter was 51 centimeters -- about 20 inches -- long. It had teeth and probably fed on insects, Godefroit said. It was found in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, China. This is the skeleton of the newly discovered dinosaur, which is about 150 million years old. This dinosaur appears to have had four wings, two along the arms and two along the legs, Godefroit said. It could probably glide but not actively fly off the ground. The specimen, exceptionally preserved in a clay sediment, appears to be an adult. This dinosaur ate like a falcon Another fossil from about 150 million years ago, called Archaeopteryx, was previously considered the most primitive known bird. Godefroit said the newly discovered dinosaur throws that into question, as the new find appears to represent an even more primitive, older bird. Alan Turner, assistant professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the study, said in an e-mail that the find was \\"a very interesting fossil discovery.\\" It demonstrates just how similar the earliest birds were to the earliest members of the dinosaur groups, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, Turner said. These groups are all theropods, small meat-eating dinosaurs that walked on two feet. Michigan cousins go after crayfish, hook a mastodon Because of how well-preserved and well-prepared the specimen is, it provides useful information about the creature's evolutionary position and the changes that were taking place in the lineage that led to birds, he said. Still, Aurornis xui's exact position in its family tree is likely not set in stone, he said. The relationships between the earliest bird species and their dinosaur relatives can change in subtle ways depending on the data set being used by particular groups of researchers. That means that species that were once called \\"birds\\" can become considered \\"troodontids,\\" or vice versa. The exact details are still being worked out, Turner said. \\"That's why new discoveries like Aurornis xui are both very exciting and frustrating because they often raise as many questions as they answer,\\" he said.

Relative atomic mass is just a way to compare the weights of different types of marbles (atoms) by choosing one marble (like a hydrogen atom) as a reference. So, instead of saying \\"this marble weighs 4 grams,\\" we say \\"this marble is 4 times heavier than the reference marble.\\" Question 2: To find the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium, we need to know the weight of one potassium atom and then multiply it by 11. Let's say that 1 potassium atom (like one of our marbles) has a weight of 39 grams. So, if we have 11 potassium atoms, we'll use: 11 atoms x 39 grams/atom = 429 grams So, the mass of 11 potassium atoms would be 429 grams. Answer: The two questions are different and their answers are not the same. Question 1 talks about various ways to describe the mass of atoms like marbles, whereas Question 2 provides the answer to the mass of a specific number of potassium atoms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!). what arrived for the woman just in time?

Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie), making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson (William Katt), reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while apparently \\"cutting himself up\\" on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner), the buyer, Jenna McCarty (Christy Carlson Romano), and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis).

Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of TV show is Kaufman's first? ? Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \\"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\\" Answer:","completion":"Kaufman's first TV show is a sitcom called Taxi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Each year a taxpayer must calculate and then pay the greater of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax.

Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ brings the funny and the feels Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” isn’t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original — but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch. Any big-budget superhero movie willing to place the opening action sequence to soft-focus background while a baby tree jams to ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky” is all right by me. The original “Guardians” (2014) was like the class clown of superhero movies, if the class clown also had a strong heart and a supple brain lurking beneath the goofball exterior. It was cool and snarky and warm and fuzzy at the same time. It was one of those movies you know you’re going to see again and enjoy just as much the second time around. “Guardians of the Galaxy 2” follows the same recipe, from the return of that lovable ragtag band of universe-saviors to the constant bickering and bantering to the “Mix Tape” soundtrack of pop-rock hits from the 1970s. (And of course, in the tradition of just about every sequel ever, we’re introduced to new, important characters as well.) I’ve always liked the corny, AM-friendly, storytelling hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. It’s put to good use here, just to the brink of overkill. I’m good with not hearing “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass until about 2020. One of the most impressive special effects in this candy-colored, explosion-riddled, 3-D extravaganza is the appearance of a young Kurt Russell in a 1980 prelude at the top of the story, in which Russell’s character of Ego is romancing Meredith Quill, who will become the mother of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. (Reports say a combination of CGI and makeup and other tricks of the trade gave us the young Kurt. I’d rather not know. It’s just pretty amazing to see what appears to be a 30ish Kurt Russell, awesome ’80s haircut flowing in the breeze.) They’re zipping down the highway, clearly in love, singing along to “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. And then Ego shows Meredith a strange orb glowing in the woods, and he talks about his master plan, and … Cut to 34 years later, with the Guardians of the Galaxy gearing up for battle. In addition to Chris Pratt’s wisecracking but noble Peter, there’s Zoe Saldana’s brave (and green) but emotionally cautious Gamora; Dave Bautista’s hulking and ferocious but rather dim and goofy Drax; the sly and outwardly selfish Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the adorable Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The Guardians get mixed up in all kinds of dangerous intergalactic hijinks interspersed with sticky-sweet sentimental moments. Songs such as Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” and Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son” set the tone (and in some cases hammer home the point). At times the special effects are wondrous and cool; other times, they’re so cheesy and obviously CGI one can’t help but wonder if that’s the effect director James Gunn and the army of special effects wizards were trying to achieve. (Scenes on various planets when oozing blue goop spreads across landscapes, apparently killing thousands of humans and other human-like species, are straight out of a B-movie.) Michael Rooker has one of the best roles in the movie as Yondu, the infamous space pirate with the blue skin and startlingly horrible teeth and red, Mohawk-like device atop his head. Yondu’s the worst! Or is he? Either way, things liven up quite a bit whenever Yondu starts controlling the deadliest arrow ever by whistling. (Man, Yondu better hope nobody ever stuffs a bunch of crackers down his throat at the wrong moment and quells the whole whistling thing.) There’s a whole lot of family dynamic at play, with the vengeful and deeply warped Nebula (Karen Gillan) intent on killing her sister Gamora; Drax establishing some kind of weird sibling kinship with the nice but creepy Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who if anything is even more socially awkward than Drax; and the major unresolved relationship in the story, between Peter and his dad, a celestial being that calls himself Ego and rules a planet (and maybe more than just one planet) of his own creation. Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell are terrific together as a father and son who have a lot of baggage to deal with, even in a superhero universe where it sometimes feels as if MOST fathers and sons are dealing with a lot of baggage. As the story gets deeper and darker and more convoluted, it’s hard to care about the particulars of the plot — especially when the screenplay is constantly reminding us not to take it too seriously, what with the references to David Hasselhoff and “Cheers” and Mary Poppins and other pop-culture touchstones. Oh, and we haven’t even talked about Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), a golden-skinned warrior princess who leads an army of supposedly perfect creations who are rather terrible at remote-control bombing missions. And yet even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat when someone suffers a serious setback, or someone does a solid and risks everything to save someone else. We look forward to the next adventure, with the hopes the Awesome Mix Tape will be the soundtrack for something just a little smarter, a little less bloated, a little more focused. ★★★ Marvel Studios presents a film written and directed by James Gunn. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content). Running time: 136 minutes.

Written and directed by James Gunn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 136 minutes.

Vol. 2 sees E.T.-abducted Earthling Peter “Star-Lord” Quill (Chris Pratt), blade-wielding warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana), tattooed muscleman Drax (Dave Bautista), hybrid handyman Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorable offshoot Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) confronting not just an expanded universe of villains but also more complicated family and romantic connections. They’ll be joined, with mixed motives and outcomes both comic and dramatic, by Gamora’s angry adopted sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), insect-faced alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and blue-skinned Ravagers bandit Yondu (Michael Rooker), the latter in a significantly enlarged role from the first Guardians, where he played Peter’s crime mentor, surrogate father and nemesis all in one. All of the above has already been revealed in multiple trailers, along with the supposed shocker that Peter’s long-gone birth father is suddenly back in his son’s life. He’s a celestial planet builder aptly called Ego, played by Kurt Russell. He wants to make up for not being there when Peter was grieving his mother’s cancer death and being kidnapped by aliens. Frome left, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 ( Disney-Marvel via AP ) The movie opens on Earth in 1980 with the man now called Ego and Peter’s mom-to-be Meredith (Laura Haddock) as they cruise a Missouri highway with the soft-rock hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” on the radio, immediately establishing itself as this movie’s main ear worm. Jump ahead 34 years and Peter and the other Guardians are fighting a giant space thingie, in a colourfully rendered battle set to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky.” They’re also irritating a superior celestial race called the Sovereign, who look like angry Oscar statues and who quickly develop a murderous grudge against the Guardians. Elizabeth Debicki is wonderfully pompous as Ayesha, their diva of a leader. And so it goes with this pinball game of a movie. The Guardians ricochet from one confrontation to another, some involving galaxy-saving and others just affairs of the heart — such as whether Peter and Gamora are ever going to acknowledge this love thing they feel coming on. Article Continued Below Fortunately, Gunn is savvy enough not to let the proceedings or the characters get too serious or too sappy. He punctures Ego’s balloon in one scene by having him interrupt his bloviating with a need to urinate. In another, Ego explains to Peter why “Brandy” is Earth’s finest song ever, which is like that moment in Dumb and Dumber when Jim Carrey says the Beatles were a huge influence on the Monkees. So even if the gags go on too long — the David Hasselhoff and Cheers references are just plain goofy — and the cheeseball soundtrack isn’t quite the retro joy it was three years ago, these Guardians are still worth hanging with, if only to marvel at the imaginative characters and production design. To those who disagree, I quote the knuckleheaded but weirdly profound Drax: “You Earthlings have hang-ups.” ||||| Disney/Marvel What an oddball corner of the Marvel space-time continuum the Guardians of the Galaxy occupy! They can do quantum leaps between interstellar dimensions while bopping to carefree ’70s dance-pop on a cassette player. They battle big, bad aliens while name-checking Mary Poppins and David Hasselhoff, and discuss their complicated interpersonal relationships through references to Sam and Diane from “Cheers.” Their high-flying dogfights happen amid audiovisual arcade game nods to Galaga and Pac-Man. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ★★★★ out of 4 stars Rating: PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive content. You don’t get more back to the future than this wholehearted embrace of sci-fi and golden oldies nostalgia. No franchise is so gifted at exploiting the popularity of superhero movies while satirizing the genre. “Deadpool” was too over the R-rated top. “Ant-Man” was too small-scale for non-geeks. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is just right. It’s hyperbolic nonsense wrapped in the colors of a neon rainbow, bouncing from one artfully wacky scenario to the next. Here it’s sleekly futuristic, there it’s older than mud. It’s the galaxy’s silliest thrill show. The film continues the threads we saw formed in the Guardians’ initial appearance as small-time mercenaries turned halfhearted defenders of the universe. We know that Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, is a cocky swashbuckler with a neurotic core, the kind of fixable bad boy Chris Pratt was born to play. Zoe Saldana is his female counterpart as Gamora, a hard-fighting green gladiatrix with an ornery streak and a tendency to tell the girlfriend-craving Peter to drop the mushy stuff because such a thing as romance between their species could never happen for real anyway. Dave Bautista’s Drax is a comically plain-spoken goliath, now trying to understand humor and laughing at every wrong moment. Vin Diesel has his deep bass tuned to a squeak in voicing Groot, the massive walking extraterrestrial tree that was felled and returned to life as a cute little humanoid twig, while Rocket the genetically enhanced raccoon (spoken by Bradley Cooper) remains as abrasive as an electric grinder. His interest in once again staving off Armageddon is purely financial: “We’re really gonna be able to jack up our prices if we’re two-time Galaxy savers!” The threats arrive on jumbled story lines. A society of gold-colored tech nerds attack the Guardians for running off with a bag of priceless light bulbs. Gamora’s jealous sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) arrives to prove she’s the family’s most efficient assassin by killing her sibling. A space army of Ravagers led by blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker), who snatched young, orphaned Peter from Earth and became his shady papa figure, comes after them to settle scores of their own. Meanwhile, in a nearby subplot, Peter meets Ego (Kurt Russell), the universal life force that actually created him. Peter and Ego have a heart-to-heart while interpreting the lyrics to Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son,” giving the maudlin song a feeling of real pathos. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) flying high in \\"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.\\" Written and directed again with tongue-in-cheek flair by James Gunn (of “Slither” and “Super” fame), this is first-rate goofy escapism. While the mentality and much of the dialogue is adolescent again, this time the adventure includes some interesting concepts and emotional undercurrents, adding a neat bonus of heart. Russell gives a nuanced turn as Ego reveals where the root word for egomania came from. Russell moves through Ego’s lifelong neglect of Peter, to his amiable warmth, and then his mercurial storming as if Ego were a classic alcoholic father. Of course there are oooh-and-aaah-worthy special effects, but they’re not the entire story. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is touching and bawdy, violent and hilarious, glamorous and goofy. It’s as close as comic book movies come to being all things to all people. ||||| Correction: A previous version on this review incorrectly described the planet of Berhert. The story has been updated. From left, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Star-Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reprise their roles in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.” It’s more expansive, more beautiful, funnier and nuttier than the first film — and it features another great soundtrack. (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) With a title slyly evoking the music-compilation aesthetic embodied by its 1970s-hit-heavy sound track, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” manages to re-create the formula of self-aware, snarky humor and unapologetic action that made the original 2014 film such a pleasing package of ear and eye candy, while at the same time avoiding the sophomore slump of sequels that risk audience fatigue by repeating rather than building on what worked the first time. The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film. The team of five quarrelsome superheroes returns intact, or mostly intact, with the barely articulate tree-man Groot having been reduced, at the end of the last film, to the sapling-size Baby Groot, still voiced by Vin Diesel, but as if he were exhaling helium from a party balloon. And the film kicks off like a party, with an opening credit sequence featuring Groot shaking his adorably twiggy booty to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” on a boombox as Chris Pratt’s Peter “Star-Lord” Quill, Zoe Saldana’s Gamora, Dave Bautista’s Drax and Bradley Cooper’s CGI raccoon Rocket do battle with an alien starbeast intent on attacking the Anulax batteries they have been hired to protect. Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) The Guardians may be mercenaries, but they’re far from all business, occasionally pausing to queue up one of Peter’s favorite tracks as a sonic backdrop to the impending action. (The filmmakers, led by returning director and co-writer James Gunn, also oblige, as in the film’s tour-de-force set piece: a scene featuring mass killing, set to “Come a Little Bit Closer” by Jay and the Americans, as a flying arrow on autopilot — the signature weapon of Michael Rooker’s Yondu the Ravager — pierces through multiple bodies over the course of the tonally inappropriate yet perfectly curated song.) That’s not the only dazzling visual, in this sharply ­choreographed and ravishingly designed comedic space opera. One scene, featuring Gamora’s green body, silhouetted against a red landscape, is so painterly pretty, a la “Avatar’s” moon of Pandora, that my eyes hurt — in a good way. The real story doesn’t get underway until our ­ethically tarnished heroes — having stolen some of the same batteries they had previously been guarding against theft — crash-land on the planet of Berhert. There, Peter meets his long-lost father, the appro­priately named Ego (Kurt Russell), leading to what appears to be a tender family reunion — and striking a tone that will characterize the rest of the film, much of which takes place on Ego’s home planet. Family — the kind that is defined by blood, and the kind for whom you will spill blood, even without sharing DNA — is the theme of this tale, which manages to evoke genuine, deep feelings, along with belly laughs. Much of the film’s humor has to do with stupidity resulting from efforts to look cool. One villain character, who has given himself the moniker Taserface (Chris Sullivan of “This Is Us”), is mocked repeatedly for the ­ineffectuality of his meant-to-be-threatening handle. In another scene, Peter compares Yondu — his surrogate father, who raised him as a child — to Mary ­Poppins, as Yondu descends from the sky, like the famous nanny, ­holding his arrow aloft like her umbrella. “Mary Poppins? Is he cool?” asks the clueless Yondu. Yes, Mary Poppins is cool, Peter reassures him, with an implied wink to the audience. Winks, of a more literal variety, are a recurring sight gag, as the cynical Rocket tries, unsuccessfully, to signal his sarcastic digs, by repeatedly batting the one eye that everyone can see. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” suffers from no such fatal exertions. Gunn, whose film includes more world building than the original movie — and the introduction of a charming new character, the buglike empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) — delivers backstory, story and the promise of stories to come with the breezy, effortless skill of a master raconteur. This is not a superhero movie in the ponderous mold of DC Comics’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” or even its fellow Marvel movies centering on Captain America and the Avengers. Falling somewhere ­between the sardonicism of the “Iron Man” trilogy and the self-aware meta-movie high jinks of the R-rated yuk-fest “Deadpool,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"\\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\" is basically the sequel to the first \\"Guardians of the Galaxy,\\" but with a lot more fun and laughs.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?, using the article: In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

He had spent years maintaining control of his darker urges, integrating with Chicago's society, and generally trying to act like a human being. This was no easy task for someone with supernatural abilities and a dark past, but it was necessary for his survival and to protect those he cared about. As a member of the White Court of vampires, his primary concern was concealing his true nature from the humans he interacted with daily. My protagonist, let's call him John, had worked hard to establish a new life in Chicago and to distance himself from the negative aspects of his vampiric heritage. His life was a delicate balancing act, as he needed to keep his kinship a secret from a number of different groups: the White Court who controlled the city's supernatural underworld, the human society he was part of, and the Council who were a powerful force within the supernatural community. The Council was a major concern for John because they had the power to expose and destroy him if they ever found out about his presence in their territory. They would have used him as a pawn to bring down the White Court, and in doing so, they would have placed him and his loved ones in great danger. The same went for the vampires who might use him to get closer to the Council. John had to be very cautious about the relationships he formed and the friendships he cultivated, always wary that his secret might be discovered. This constant state of vigilance was a heavy burden for John, but he managed to bear it while maintaining the facade of a normal human being. He formed friendships, found love, and even built a career in Chicago. He became a valuable member of that society, using his abilities to help others in need without revealing his true nature. Over time, his resolve grew stronger, and he was determined to never let his darker instincts control him again. However, nothing lasts forever, and eventually, something terrible happened to John that shattered his carefully constructed world. He was attacked by an unknown supernatural force, and in the process of defending himself and his friends, he was forced to reveal his secret to someone close to him. This exposed him not only to the Council, but also to other supernatural factions within the city who sought to exploit or eliminate him. The revelation of his secret also shattered the trust and relationships he had built over the years with those who knew him only as a human. Despite the adversity he faced, John did not give up. Understanding the gravity of the situation, he realized that his only chance of survival was to face his fears and confront his past demons. He stopped trying to blend into human society and instead embraced his true nature as a member of the White Court. This was a difficult transition, as he needed to learn how to navigate life without hiding who he was and face the many supernatural challenges that lay ahead. In doing so, John reconnected with his White Court siblings and began to forge alliances with other supernatural beings in the city who were willing to aid him in his battles against the forces that sought his destruction. It was during this time that he discovered that whoever had attacked him was part of a larger plot by an unknown enemy who wanted to control not only the White Court but all of the supernatural factions within Chicago. Together, John and his newfound allies fought back against their enemies and strove to protect not only their own, but also the innocent humans who were caught in the crossfire. Throughout his journey, John learned that it was possible to accept his vampiric heritage without succumbing to the darkness within him. Only by embracing his true self - both the light and the darkness - could he hope to protect his loved ones, vanquish his enemies, and ultimately find peace with his dual identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. On 22 August, nearly two months after the main uprisings had been defeated, about 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed in the north-west of the country, at Kilcummin in County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 local rebels, they had some initial success, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the British in Castlebar and setting up a short-lived \\"Irish Republic\\" with John Moore as president of one of its provinces, Connacht. This sparked some supportive uprisings in Longford and Westmeath which were quickly defeated, and the main force was defeated at the battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798. The Irish Republic had only lasted twelve days from its declaration of independence to its collapse. The French troops who surrendered were repatriated to France in exchange for British prisoners of war, but hundreds of the captured Irish rebels were executed. This episode of the 1798 Rebellion became a major event in the heritage and collective memory of the West of Ireland and was commonly known in Irish as Bliain na bhFrancach and in English as \\"The Year of the French\\". On 12 October 1798, a larger French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including Wolfe Tone himself, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a larger Royal Navy squadron, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. Wolfe Tone was tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. He asked for death by firing squad, but when this was refused, Tone cheated the hangman by slitting his own throat in prison on 12 November, and died a week later. How many days after soldiers under General Humbert landed at Kilcummin did Wolfe Tone, attempted to land in County Donegal","completion":"Soldiers under General Humbert landed at Kilcummin in County Mayo on August 22, 1798. Wolfe Tone attempted to land in County Donegal on October 12, 1798. There are 51 days between these two dates. Therefore, it was 51 days after General Humbert's landing that Wolfe Tone attempted to land in County Donegal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process is the muscle fiber getting a signal from its nerve. This occurs when the nervous system sends an electrical signal, called an action potential, to the muscle fiber through a specialized nerve cell called a motor neuron. The motor neuron's axon terminal makes contact with the muscle fiber at a junction known as the neuromuscular junction. At this junction, the action potential reaches the nerve terminal, causing the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). The acetylcholine molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to the receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane, which subsequently results in the generation of an action potential within the muscle fiber. This action potential initiates the series of steps involving proteins and chemicals that release energy, leading to the contraction or relaxation of the muscle and ultimately the movement of the bones connected to the muscle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The history of the Ottoman Empire during World War I began with the Ottoman engagement in the Middle Eastern theatre. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut. The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, and set the partition of the Ottoman Empire under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The occupation of Constantinople and İzmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname \\"Atatürk\\"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Why is bistro called like that? Context: In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.

Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, the large sign's electrons are at a higher energy level.

A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71. Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem.

The San Francisco police faced criticism and numerous inquiries following their statement concerning the search. Apple did not initially return an official's request for comment, leading to uncertainty around the search until the police could confer with Apple. According to an interview with the man whose house was searched, he had consented to the search, believing that the individuals conducting it were police officers. It was later revealed that they were Apple employees, which led to concerns about misrepresentation and potential legal implications. Misrepresenting oneself as a police officer is a crime, but police are allowed to mislead suspects in certain circumstances. The investigation into this case was confirmed by Lt.

The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily.

PUBLISHED:. 14:10 EST, 12 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:54 EST, 12 May 2013. Astronauts making a rare, hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the International Space Station this weekend in the hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak. The prospects of success grew as the minutes, then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared. Mission Control said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged, although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory. 'I will tell you that we're happy. We're very happy,' said Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy space station program manager. The spacewalk outside the International Space Station was captured on film by the tweeting, Facebooking, social media maven and space station commander Chris Hadfield. 'Amazing day,' he said. 'EVA (extra-vehicular activity) went off without a hitch. Great crew, phenomenal ground support and a supportive audience. Who could ask for anything more?' Space: Cassidy and Marshburn work outside the ISS in the 'approaching orbital sunset, the harshest of light, a blackness like endless velvet,' said Hadfield. Illuminating: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn turn on their helmet lights 'doing their best to light the universe on the dark side of the Earth,' said Chris Hadfield. One small step: 'Climbing out of the airlock, quite the commute to work!' said Chris Hadfield via Twitter. Chris Cassidy, Navy SEAL and lead spacewalker on Saturday. Say cheese: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn take a minute with visors open to have their picture taken by Chris Hadfield, inside the ISS. Dr. Tom Marshburn, well-dressed for a day's work outdoors. 'We didn't see any obvious signs of a leak, but it's going to take some. time...for us to look at the system, evaluate the system and make sure. we did, indeed, stop the leak.' Montalbano expects it will take 'a good four weeks, five weeks, maybe even a few weeks longer.' 'Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,' he told reporters. Christopher. Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn installed the new pump after removing the. old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days. earlier. They uncovered 'no smoking guns' responsible for the leak and. consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear. from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side. Spacewalk: Astronaut Chris Cassidy took photos as he worked on repairs to the ISS on May 11, 2013. Cassidy and crewmate Tom Marshburn are believed to have repaired the dangerous ammonia leak. Concern: NASA emphasized that the lives of the multinational crew were not in danger but both Russian and US space experts were scrambling to swiftly fix the problem. Emergency: This picture shows the astronauts being prepared for their spacewalk at the International Space Station. Ammonia: Astronauts discovered a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system. 'Let. us know if you see anything,' Mission Control urged as the fresh pump. was cranked up. Thirty minutes later, all was still well. 'No snow,' the. astronauts radioed. 'We have our eyes on it and haven't seen a thing,' Marshburn said. NASA. said the leak, while significant, never jeopardized crew safety. The. space agency never before staged such a fast, impromptu spacewalk for a. station crew. Even during the shuttle program, unplanned spacewalks. were uncommon. The. ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into Saturday's spacewalk. So. it was disheartening for NASA, at first, as Cassidy and Marshburn. reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump. 'All. the pipes look shiny clean, no crud,' Cassidy said as he used a long,. dentist-like mirror to peer into tight, deep openings. 'I can't give you any good data other than nominal, unfortunately. No smoking guns.' Engineers. determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump, despite. the lack of visible damage to the old one. The entire team - weary and. stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days - gained more and more. confidence as the 5 1/2-hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks. of ammonia popping up. 'Gloved. fingers crossed,' space station commander Chris Hadfield said in a. tweet from inside. 'No leaks!' he wrote a half-hour later. Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized. Crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station on Thursday. Flight. controllers in Houston worked furiously to get ready for Saturday's. operation, completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours. The astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they. rocketed into orbit. This area on the space station is prone to leaks. The. ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space. station's electronic equipment. There are eight of these power channels,. and all seven others were operating normally. 'We. may not have found exactly the smoking gun,' Cassidy said, 'but to pull. off what this team did yesterday and today, working practically 48. straight hours, it was a remarkable effort on everybody's behalf.' NASA. officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted. Ammonia already. had been seeping ever so slightly from the location, but the flow. increased dramatically Thursday. Montalbano. did not know, as of Saturday evening, how much ammonia was lost. Another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply. With. the repair work behind them, the astronauts and ground controllers. turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six. crewmen. Marshburn. has been on the space station since December and is set to return to. Earth late Monday, along with Hadfield, a Canadian, and Russian Roman. Romanenko. Cassidy is a new arrival, on board for just 1 1/2 months. By coincidence, the two Americans performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before, during a shuttle visit in 2009. 'This. type of event is what the years of training were for,' Hadfield said in. a tweet Friday. 'A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in. space.'

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long has Donald Trump probably been in politics?

Answer the following question: Question: what is a lapping machine I found the following answer on Google: This can take two forms. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, that answer does not provide a clear or detailed explanation of what a lapping machine is. A lapping machine is a precision finishing device used in various industries for the purpose of smoothing, polishing, or achieving the required surface finish on a workpiece. It functions by rubbing two surfaces together with an abrasive material between them. This process helps to achieve a high level of surface accuracy and to remove burrs, surface irregularities, and other defects. Lapping machines typically consist of a lapping plate, which is either flat or cylindrical, and various fixtures to hold the workpiece in place. The abrasive material, also known as a lapping compound, is a loose mixture of various grain sizes, suspended in a liquid medium like water or oil. Lapping machines are used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, and precision manufacturing for refining and finishing critical components, including fuel injection nozzles, mechanical seals, valve seats, and optical lens elements, among others. The lapping process can be carried out using machines with manual control or through automated machines with computer numerical control (CNC) for better precision and efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a hypothesis: The falls are one of the largest in Japan. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is true. It is important to consider that the premise and hypothesis are two distinct statements, and there is no direct correlation between the two that proves the hypothesis true if the premise is true. In the premise, it is mentioned that the Shiraito Falls are located due south of Motosu-ko and are a great location for a picnic. However, this information does not offer any insight into the size of the falls or their ranking among the largest waterfalls in Japan. Furthermore, the hypothesis asserts that the Shiraito Falls are one of the largest waterfalls in Japan. To validate this claim, one would need additional information regarding the size and ranking of waterfalls in Japan, including the width, height, volume, and any other relevant factors that contribute to their size or popularity. Comparing these factors against those of the Shiraito Falls could potentially verify the hypothesis. In conclusion, without any additional information linking the two statements or validating the hypothesis separately, it is not possible to establish that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. To confirm the hypothesis, one must gather more information about the size and ranking of waterfalls in Japan and directly compare them with the Shiraito Falls."},{"prompt":"Question: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A? Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...

Solve -41 - 31 = -12*b for b.","completion":"To solve the equation -41 - 31 = -12*b for b, you should follow these steps: 1. First, simplify the left side of the equation so that it becomes easier to deal with. The operation -41 - 31 equals -72, therefore the equation becomes -72 = -12*b. 2. Next, you want to isolate 'b'. To do this, you have to divide both sides of the equation by -12. 3. When you divide -72 by -12, the result is 6. And on the right side of the equation, -12b divided by -12 just leaves b. Therefore, the solution to the equation becomes b = 6. The reason we divide both sides of the equation by the same number is to keep the equation balanced, while allowing us to isolate the variable. This gives us the solution. Now we can substitute b = 6 into the original equation to check if it holds true: -41 - 31 = -12*6 => -72 = -72 which is True. Therefore, b = 6 is the correct solution to this equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

What is the best way to: How to keep bread from going off?","completion":"To determine the best way to keep bread from going off, I will consider various storage methods and factors that affect bread's freshness. Step 1: Understand the factors causing the bread to go off There are a few factors that cause bread to spoil or become stale: - Exposure to air causing the bread to dry out - High humidity, promoting mold growth - Temperature: too much heat may speed up the staling process, whereas too much cold may affect the bread's texture Step 2: Consider various storage methods for bread There are several methods for storing bread to keep it fresh: - In a bread box or container - In a plastic bag or wrap - In a paper bag - In a cool and dry place - In the refrigerator - In the freezer Step 3: Evaluate the pros and cons of each storage method - Bread box/container: It provides an environment with reduced airflow, slowing down mold growth. However, it may still be prone to drying out or staling if not properly sealed. - Plastic bag/wrap: It helps retain the moisture, but increases the potential for mold growth. - Paper bag: It allows the bread to \\"breathe\\" and can prevent mold, but the bread might still dry out quickly. - Cool and dry place: It prevents mold growth, but the bread will still be exposed to air, causing it to stale or dry out. - Refrigerator: While it can slow down mold growth, refrigeration can actually cause bread to stale faster due to a process called \\"retrogradation.\\" - Freezer: Freezing bread prevents mold growth and staling, but the bread has to be thawed before use, which might not be as convenient. Step 4: Determine the best storage method Based on the evaluation, the freezer seems to provide the best solution for keeping bread fresh for a longer period of time without promoting mold growth or staling. However, the bread will require thawing before consumption. Step 5: Implement the best storage method To store bread in the freezer: 1. Slice the bread if it is not already sliced. 2. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or a freezer-safe plastic bag to minimize air exposure. 3. Place the wrapped bread in a resealable freezer-safe plastic bag. 4. Label the bag with the bread type and date of storage. 5. Put the bag in the freezer, and store the bread up to three months. To use the frozen bread, remove the desired number of slices, and allow them to thaw at room temperature for about 30 minutes or gently toast them in a toaster or oven. By following these steps, you can keep bread from going off for a longer period and enjoy its freshness whenever desired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 2: Identify the key components in both sentences. - Sentence 1: (Location: Sacred Heart Medical Center), (Situation: in surgery), (Information about injuries: extent not available), (Source: Bragdon) - Sentence 2: (Location: Sacred Heart Medical Center), (Situation: in critical condition), (Source: police news release) Step 3: Compare the key components in both sentences. - Both sentences mention the same location: Sacred Heart Medical Center. - The situation differs in both sentences: Sentence 1 mentions the teen undergoing surgery, whereas Sentence 2 mentions the teen in critical condition. - Sentence 1 states that the extent of injuries is not available, while Sentence 2 does not provide any information about the injuries but mentions that the teen is in critical condition. - The sources of information are different : Bragdon in Sentence 1 and police news release in Sentence 2.

But the possibility existed that BP would be required to open it in the event of a storm and the evacuation of underwater robots and other equipment that are keeping a close watch for any new leaks. Allen said that after days of consultations and careful monitoring, federal scientists were confident enough in their knowledge of the surrounding seabed to leave the well sealed and will no longer require BP to get daily extensions for the seal. “What we’re slowly doing is understanding the neighborhood, creating a 3-D model of the neighborhood,” Allen said. with winds exceeding 39 mph is expected to reach the vicinity of the well site 50 miles off the Louisiana coast early Saturday, possibly forcing evacuation of the fleet of response and drilling vessels.

Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

He quickly became a favorite with child audiences, and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy On with the Show (1929). He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor Warner Brothers musical comedies including: Sally (1929), Hold Everything (1930), Song of the West (1930), and Going Wild (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared. He appeared in Fireman, Save My Child (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Elmer, the Great (1933) with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd and Alibi Ike (1935) with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs. In 1933 he starred in Son of a Sailor with Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in A Very Honorable Guy with Alice White and Robert Barrat, in The Circus Clown again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess, and with Maxine Doyle in Six-Day Bike Rider. Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) and was highly praised for his performance. He starred in Polo Joe (1936) with Carol Hughes and Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher, and in Sons o' Guns. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top ten earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic Film Fun for twenty years from 1933. He left Warner Brothers to work for producer David L. Loew, starring in When's Your Birthday? (1937). In 1938, he starred in The Gladiator, a loose film adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator that influenced the creation of Superman. He gradually switched to making \\"B\\" pictures.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls? ? Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \\"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man – jokers and jesters too – devoted above all to art rather than to business.\\" Answer:","completion":"The name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article.

Which person learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean? Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","completion":"Barry learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. His specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor is directly related to the processes occurring in the Ring of Fire, such as the subduction of oceanic crust along plate boundaries, which leads to volcanic activity. Will's specialization in montology, the study of mountains, is less directly related to the complex geological processes taking place in the Ring of Fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To successfully complete his mission, the spy had to carefully devise a plan which involved multiple steps. Step 1: Gather intelligence on the facility Before making any moves, the spy had to gather as much information as possible about the facility. This included identifying the layout, security measures, and employee routines. By doing so, the spy could pinpoint the location of the note and prepare for possible obstacles. Step 2: Infiltrate the facility After acquiring a thorough understanding of the facility, the spy had to find an inconspicuous way to enter. Opting for a disguise, the spy posed as a maintenance worker to bypass initial security and gain access to restricted areas. Step 3: Reach the note's location With the disguise in place, the spy redirected the attention of the guards to create a clear path to the note’s location. This involved tampering with security systems, such as disabling CCTV cameras, to ensure that any suspicious activity went unnoticed. Step 4: Retrieve the paper Once at the note's location, the spy used advanced lock-picking skills to access the room where the paper was stored. The spy quickly grabbed the paper and concealed it in their tool bag, making sure not to leave any traces behind. Step 5: Attempt to acquire the note While obtaining the paper went smoothly, the note proved to be more challenging. It was stored in a highly secure vault, guarded by both heavy surveillance and reinforced doors. With the limited time the spy had before arousing suspicion, they made the difficult decision to abandon the quest for the note. Step 6: Exfiltrate the facility The spy knew that escaping with the paper was crucial, and any further effort towards acquiring the note would jeopardize the mission. Therefore, the spy carefully retraced their steps and left the facility, using their disguise to blend in with the exiting employees. Step 7: Deliver the paper to headquarters After successfully leaving the facility, the spy covertly handed over the retrieved paper to their handler. Although the note was not recovered, the information on the paper served as valuable intelligence that contributed to the overall success of the mission. In conclusion, the spy's resourcefulness, adaptability, and strategic thinking allowed them to retrieve crucial information despite facing numerous challenges. While the mission was not completed entirely as planned, the spy's actions still made a significant impact on the ongoing intelligence operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The story is set in an alternate reality America circa 1985 under the authoritarian control of President Fremont. It makes liberal references to the collected works of Philip K. Dick. Berkeley record store clerk Nick Brady lives modestly with his wife Rachel and their infant son. Nick has been experiencing strange visions and dreams. He confides in Rachel and his best friend, science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS. One recurring symbol that he has been seeing is an ichthys. While he and Phil sit at a table, an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick's head. He rushes his son to the ER, convinced that he has an inguinal hernia. The skeptical doctor is stunned to find that Nick is right. Nick has subsequent visions that tell him that he should relocate to Los Angeles, where he lands a job at a record label. Philip gets visited by two members of FAP (Friends of the American People). They press him for information about Nick's visions. The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip. After their liaison, she pretends to be underage, hoping to coerce him into revealing what Nick is seeing from VALIS. Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick. Meanwhile, Nick has a dream where a woman is singing. During the dream, someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive. Eventually, the woman turns up at Nick's record label, looking for a clerical job. She introduces herself as Sylvia, and Nick just assumes that she is a singer. Sylvia gradually reveals that she also receives visions from VALIS.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Input: Background Paragraph: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Story: There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but have different characteristics. For example, cell Z is smaller than cell X. Furthermore, scientists studying the two cells have recorded that cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z.

Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity. Question: Which of the following can we infer from the passage?

When we rounded the corner, I couldn't believe what I saw. There was the biggest waterfall I could ever imagine, right in front of me. \\"Cool!\\" I said, and I could feel my eyes getting bigger and a smile tugging at my mouth. \\"Still think there's nothing here for you?\\" asked Gary. \\"Because there's a whole lot more of this kind of 'nothing' around here.\\" I had to admit, the waterfall was impressive. \\"Look,\\" said Gary, \\"camp is what you make it.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis? is inside the article: Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian..., can you guess it ?

Stepping in to DeFalco's takes me back to the days where we'd spend all day in Grandma's kitchen preparing for Sunday family dinner. Preparing everything from homemade sauce, meatballs, chicken parmesan, and almond biscotti to name a few. DeFalco's offers an extensive menu (both for takeout and dine-in), and although I venture here 2-3 times per week I remain loyal to a few selections on their menu. If you are feeling like a sandwich I urge you to order the homemade Meatball Sandwich on the crispy baguette - or - if you're feeling like chicken then I must recommend you try the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (again, on the crispy baguette). I'm a hot/toasted sandwich type of girl so I can't speak for the cold sandwiches, but I can assure you won't be disappointed with any selection given that all their breads are delivered fresh daily, meats and cheeses are sliced to order in house, and their toppings are fresh to boot! To complete my go-to list I also recommend trying the Chicken Pesto Salad and a few side salads including the tuna pasta salad (BEST EVER), the chicken caesar pasta salad, pesto pasta salad, and....the tomato and basil salad (of course you must drizzle a little evoo and balsamic to make it truly Italian). They also offer many pasta dishes, pizza/calzones, soups & sides, salads and desserts, oh my, and nothing will leave you disappointed or starving for more since their portions are generous in size (it's an Italian thing)!! And not only does DeFalco's do Italian favorites just right, but their store is also stocked with Italian specialty foods for purchase (hint grocery in the name), and many wonderful and rare wine selections only to be found in their store.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? spirited film Pick your answer from: (a). negative; (b). positive;","completion":"(b). positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"spirited film\\" is positive. The term \\"spirited\\" when used to describe a movie or film generally implies a sense of liveliness, energy, enthusiasm, or vivacity. It usually means that the film is full of heart or passion that it manages to convey through its storytelling, acting, direction, cinematography, and other elements. Typically, this would refer to a film that is engaging, dynamic, uplifting, or inspirational in some way. Therefore, the sentiment is certainly positive as it implies a degree of enjoyment and appreciation. The phrase would most likely be used as praise by a reviewer or audience member, in both informal conversation or formal critique. In evaluating sentiment, we are looking at the tone or mood conveyed by the language used. Sentiment may be positive, negative, or neutral. Positive sentiment indicates a favorable or optimistic view of the subject in question. Negative sentiment, on the other hand, suggests an unfavorable or pessimistic view. Neutral sentiment indicates a lack of particularly strong feelings either way; the language used is neither strongly positive nor negative. In this case, the use of 'spirited' indicates a positive sentiment. To further analyze this sentence, one must understand the role of adjectives and how they convey sentiment. The word \\"spirited\\" is an adjective that is being used to describe the noun \\"film\\". Adjectives in language are used to add characteristics or attributes to the noun, these can include emotions, qualities, amounts, size, condition, origin etc. The adjective used here express an emotional state - spirited being positive here. This notion of sentiment analysis plays a significant role in fields such as data mining, social media monitoring, brand management, and consumer reviews, where understanding public opinion or mood towards a particular item, product, or event is of utmost important.

Liverpool’s penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers’s side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made a number of changes throughout Wednesday’s match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium …. Scroll down for videos. First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly. Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side a much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn’t the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City’s opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be a key player in that deep-lying role again this season. ‘We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got a toe on it,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘But he’s been playing that role for the last 12 months and I’m sure he’ll play it this season as well. He’s got a wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he’s very committed.’ Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield. Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time. It’s early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure’s effort as the Ivorian made a subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: ‘We played two different formations – a 4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of a 4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations. Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties. ‘We had a connection through Coutinho who played a lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.’ City lined up in more of a conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium. In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time. ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.’ Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool’s substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied a sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening’s exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from a goal down. ‘Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive,’ he said. ‘The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased. Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. ‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ said the City boss. ‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.’ Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted a gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence. City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero, a new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out a work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead. Trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \\"Diane Selwyn\\".

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. Paragraph: Two brothers have a piece of land each, situated 2 miles from each other.

How do you do this: How to store some chips you've already opened?","completion":"Storing opened chips properly is essential for keeping them fresh, crisp, and tasty for as long as possible. Here are several methods and tips for storing your opened chips: Method 1: Using a chip clip or a clothespin 1. Roll down the top: Once you have opened the bag of chips, consume the desired amount and shake any remaining crumbs down to the bottom. 2. Press the air out: Gently press the top of the bag to push out the excess air while being careful not to crush the chips. 3. Roll the top: Roll the top of the bag down tightly to create a good seal. It is essential to minimize contact with air to prevent the chips from going stale. 4. Secure the top: Use a chip clip or a clothespin to secure the top of the bag, ensuring that no air can enter. Method 2: Plastic storage container or zipper bags 1. Choose the right container: Select an airtight plastic container or a resealable zipper bag that can comfortably accommodate the quantity of chips you have remaining. A tight seal is vital to preserve freshness. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully pour or place the chips into the chosen container. Seal the container or zipper bag. 3. Store the container: Place the container in a dry, cool place, such as a cupboard or pantry to preserve taste and protect from sunlight and heat. Method 3: Using a rubber band 1. Prepare the bag: After consuming the desired amount of chips and shaking the crumbs down, gently press the air out of the bag. 2. Roll and twist the top: Roll the top of the bag down a bit and then twist the top to create a makeshift seal. 3. Secure with a rubber band: Wrap a rubber band tightly around the twisted top of the bag, ensuring that it grips and holds the twist in place. Method 4: Using airtight glass jars 1. Choose an appropriately sized jar: Find a glass jar with an airtight seal and wide opening to accommodate the remaining chips. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully place or pour the chips into the jar with minimal crushing. 3. Seal and store: Close the lid tightly to preserve the chips' freshness and store the jar in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Method 5: The water displacement method (great for camping) 1. Prepare a large zipper bag: Pour the remaining chips into a large resealable zipper bag. 2. Submerge the bag partially in water: With the bag's top open, submerge it gently into a container of water, just enough to displace the air inside but not allowing any water to enter the bag. 3. Seal the bag: As you reach the end of the submersion, seal the bag tightly to trap the air out of it. The water's pressure should have forced out the remaining air. Whichever method you choose, make sure to consume the opened chips within about 1-2 weeks to enjoy their freshness and taste fully. Remember not to expose the stored chips to direct sunlight, heat, or humid environments, as these factors will compromise their quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\\"? A:","completion":"Question: Which figures in medieval paintings were often depicted wearing red mantles, and how does the use of red in these paintings and other historical contexts symbolize authority and importance? The passage highlights the significance of the color red throughout history, particularly in the context of authority figures and religious settings. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne chose red for his palace and shoes during his coronation as a symbol of his authority. This association with royalty continued as kings, princes, and eventually Roman Catholic cardinals began wearing red costumes. Abbe Suger's rebuilding of Saint Denis Basilica introduced stained glass windows featuring red glass tinted with copper, which imbued the space with a mystical light. The incorporation of these windows extended to other cathedrals across France, England, and Germany. The passage then specifically mentions that in medieval painting, red was often utilized to attract attention to important figures. The striking color highlighted the significance of both Christ and the Virgin Mary, who were frequently depicted wearing red mantles. The recurring theme of red representing power, authority, and holiness exemplifies its enduring symbolism throughout various aspects of history and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story takes place entirely in New York. Armando works part-time at his parents' restaurant and is also a custodian at a dance studio, where he secretly practices dance moves. He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin, a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel. She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves. When Armando realizes that Mia has left her scarf behind, he calls out to her from the studio's second floor window. On the sidewalk below, Mia turns to cross the street, when she struck by a taxi and rendered a paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. Upon learning of this, Daniel jilts her. Armando tries to boost her confidence and persuades her and other disabled people in the local rehabilitation center, including a \\"punky\\" Latina, Nikki and a wounded Iraq-war veteran, Kenny, (Morgan Spector) to enter a wheelchair ballroom dancing competition. Despite the opposition of his mother, Armando and Mia gradually fall in love and enter into a relationship, while Armando's uncle Wilfredo falls in love with Chantelle, a disabled trans woman at the rehab center. Before the competition, Armando's mother, who has been maneuvering to get Armando hooked up with the beautiful Rosa, does her best to undermine (even to the point of \\"casting spells\\") the relationship between him and Mia, which has become sexually intimate by now. But Rosa understands, and generously breaks off with Armando.","completion":"The first names of the two people who Daniel catches dancing together briefly are Armando and Mia."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},R={key:1};function z(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
