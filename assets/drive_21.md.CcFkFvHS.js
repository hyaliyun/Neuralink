Given the question: As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable. Doctors who have toys in their waiting rooms also are advised to see if any of them have been recalled and to check for chipped, flaking paint-even on those that haven't yet been recalled--since new announcements of toy risk continue.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you harvest the leaves off of a Yucca plant?","completion":"To harvest leaves from a Yucca plant, it is important to consider several factors to ensure that the plant is not harmed or damaged. Both the following solutions offer safe and efficient methods, and by examining their advantages and drawbacks, we can determine the better option: Solution 1: Manual harvesting with a sharp knife and gloves 1. Advantages: a. No need for specialized equipment; only a sharp knife and gloves are required. b. Direct control over the process, ensuring minimal damage to the rest of the plant. c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations. d. Environmentally friendly as no power tools are used. 2. Drawbacks: a. Time-consuming, especially for larger Yucca plants or multiple harvests. b. Physically demanding as it requires precise cutting and potential bending or reaching. c. Risk of injury if proper care is not taken with the sharp knife. Solution 2: Using specialized hand pruners or shears 1. Advantages: a. Designed specifically for cutting leaves or stems, providing a clean and accurate cut. b. Less physically demanding as the pruners/shears provide leverage for the cutting process. c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations. d. Faster process compared to using a simple knife. 2. Drawbacks: a. Cost of purchasing specialized hand pruners or shears. b. Potential for causing damage to the plant if not used correctly or if pruners/shears are dull. c. Still requires manual labour and time investment, although typically less than with a knife. Both solutions can effectively harvest leaves off a Yucca plant. However, the better solution should address the key concerns of efficiency, ease of use, and minimal damage to the plant. Based on the advantages and drawbacks, Solution 2 (using specialized hand pruners or shears) emerges as the better option. Using specialized hand pruners or shears offers a faster and less physically demanding process compared to manually cutting the leaves with a knife. This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with multiple plants or larger specimens. The specialized pruners/shears are designed specifically for this type of task and provide clean and accurate cuts, further minimizing the risk of causing unnecessary harm to the plant. While Solution 2 does involve some investment in purchasing the right tools, this cost is typically justified by the improved harvesting process and higher overall efficacy. However, it is crucial to ensure that the pruners or shears are well-maintained and used correctly and that the users are familiar with the proper techniques to minimize damage to the Yucca plant while harvesting its leaves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stick each pair of suction cups on either side of the granite seam.\\"","completion":"The Art of Granite Installation: Seamlessly Uniting Two Pieces for a Sleek Finish Granite countertops are renowned for their durability, aesthetic appeal, and easy maintenance. Natural stones like granite are known for their unique appearance, making them a popular and sought-after choice for kitchens and bathrooms. The beauty of these stones lies not only in their individual patterns and hues but also in how well they are installed, leaving a seamless connection between the pieces. The process requires precision, patience, and skillful techniques. In this article, we will explore one such technique that professionals use to achieve a beautifully joined granite seam: connecting two granite pieces using turnbuckles and suction cups. # Before You Begin Carefully plan and prepare for the granite installation. It is wise to entrust the task to skilled professionals as it involves precise measurements and handling of heavy materials. Granite countertops are custom made, ensuring that they match perfectly with the existing room dimensions and the desired design. Consult with your granite fabricator for expert guidance, who will take detailed measurements before procuring the granite. # Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting Two Granite Pieces using Turnbuckles and Suction Cups Follow these steps to seamlessly unite two pieces of granite for polished and well-connected countertops: 1. **Prepare the workspace**: Clean the area where the granite countertops will be installed, ensuring that there is no dirt or debris that might hinder the installation process. It is necessary to have a flat and stable surface, such as plywood, for the granite to rest upon. 2. **Clean the granite**: Use a lint-free cloth and stone cleaner to remove any dust or dirt from the granite pieces. This ensures that the suction cups stick securely to the granite surfaces and promotes proper adherence of the epoxy during installation. 3. **Position the granite pieces**: Neatly lay the two pieces of granite side-by-side, aligning the edges to make sure they match perfectly. Pay attention to the seam, ensuring that it appears straight and follows the flow of the granite pattern. 4. **Thread turnbuckles through suction cups**: Prepare 2-3 pairs of suction cups with attached turnbuckles (metal devices used for tightening or loosening ropes). Turnbuckles usually consist of a threaded loop attached to two hooks. Thread the turnbuckles through the suction cups so that they can be used to hold and adjust the granite pieces during the seam connection process. 5. **Attach suction cups to granite**: Stick one of each suction cup pair on either side of the granite seam, directly opposite each other. Ensure that the turnbuckles are properly connected so that they can pull the granite pieces together. 6. **Apply epoxy**: Apply a color-matched epoxy along the seam to connect the two granite pieces. Ensure that the epoxy completely fills the seam, starting from the center and working your way outward. The epoxy should match the color and pattern of your granite, creating a seamless appearance when cured. 7. **Tighten the turnbuckles**: Use the turnbuckles to pull the granite pieces together, tightening the seam and allowing the epoxy to settle properly. Adjust the turnbuckles to ensure that the granite surfaces are flush with each other. 8. **Remove excess epoxy**: Once the epoxy is sufficiently cured, remove any excess using a razor blade or putty knife. Be careful not to create any scratches or marks on the granite surface. 9. **Perform a final inspection**: Inspect the seam to ensure that it is smooth, flush, and matches your granite's original pattern. Check the surrounding areas as well, making sure that no damage has occurred during the installation process. 10. **Seal the granite**: Apply a high-quality stone sealer to the granite countertop, following the manufacturer's instructions. This step helps protect the granite from stains and ensures the longevity of your beautiful countertop. In conclusion, uniting two pieces of granite using turnbuckles and suction cups is an effective, professional technique to attain a sleek, seamless finish for your granite countertops. With careful planning, measurement, and execution, you can achieve a beautifully connected granite surface that will stand the test of time and add style and value to your home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Explanation: The premise states that the Administrator is responsible for allocating allowances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, subject to the provisions of section 417. The provisions mentioned in section 417 are not defined in the given context, but it can be assumed that these provisions give guiding principles, limitations, or conditions for the allocation of allowances. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts that the Administrator has no power to allocate allowances. This hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly outlines the Administrator's responsibility in allocating allowances, albeit subject to certain provisions. The presence of section 417 provisions does not negate the Administrator's power to allocate allowances; it just implies that the power must be exercised according to the specified provisions. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While both statements address the role of the Administrator in allocating allowances, the premise assigns this role to the Administrator with certain conditions, while the hypothesis denies the Administrator's authority altogether.

Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

Why do some VPN tunnels go down when they don’t see traffic for a while? What is the danger of doing P2P while VPN is on? Available options: (1). no; (2). yes; The answer is:","completion":"(1). No; The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of VPN usage. Let's take a closer look at the two questions to understand the differences between them. 1. Why do some VPN tunnels go down when they don’t see traffic for a while? This question is about the behavior of VPN tunnels in regards to traffic flow. VPN tunnels provide a secure and private channel for data transfer between your device and a remote server by encrypting and encapsulating data. In some cases, when there is no traffic or data transfer happening for a certain period of time, the VPN tunnel may go down. This can happen due to various reasons: - Timeout settings: Many VPNs have a timeout setting or control inactivity period, during which they wait for the next data packet. If a packet is not received within this time, the VPN tunnel might be disconnected for security reasons or to save resources. - Network instability: If the internet connection is unstable, it might cause the VPN tunnel to go down every once in a while. - VPN server maintenance or reboots: Sometimes, servers need to undergo maintenance, updates or reboots, which can momentarily affect VPN tunnels connected to them. 2. What is the danger of doing P2P while VPN is on? This question addresses the potential risks associated with using peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks while connected to a VPN. P2P networks allow users to share and download files directly from others, without the need for a central server. However, these networks can pose several risks, especially when users share copyrighted or illegal content. Using a VPN while engaging in P2P file sharing can help protect your privacy and anonymity by masking your IP address, making it harder for other users or authorities to identify or track your activities. However, there still are some dangers: - VPN reliability: If the VPN connection drops while connected to a P2P network, your real IP address could be exposed, which could lead to possible legal consequences or surveillance by third parties. - Logs and privacy policies: Some VPN services may keep logs or have weak privacy policies, which can leave traces of your P2P activities. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to choose a reliable VPN with a strict no-log policy. - Malware and cyberthreats: P2P networks are known for being an easy target for cybercriminals to distribute malware among unsuspecting users. Using a VPN can mask your IP address, but it does not provide protection against downloading malicious files. In conclusion, both questions touch on different aspects of VPN usage. The first question deals with VPN tunnel stability and possible causes of disconnection. The second question discusses the potential risks associated with P2P file sharing while using a VPN. Therefore, the answer is (1). No, the questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"The wife, or okugatasama (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend the home forcibly.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did samurai wives' duties include when their husbands were away?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The wife, or okugatasama (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend the home forcibly.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What did samurai wives' duties include when their husbands were away?\\" However, it would be more helpful to provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to properly address the question. In feudal Japan, samurai wives, or okugatasama, had several important duties and responsibilities while their husbands were away. These duties can be broadly categorized into household management, child rearing, and defending the home, as mentioned in the given sentence. Here is a more detailed breakdown of their roles: 1. Household management: Samurai wives were expected to manage the day-to-day affairs of the household. This included overseeing the servants, maintaining the finances, and ensuring that everything ran smoothly in their spouse's absence. They were highly skilled in various domestic tasks and often played a crucial role in maintaining the family's social standing by hosting and entertaining guests of the samurai household. Furthermore, they were responsible for managing the family's resources, including land and property, as well as organizing agricultural activities. 2. Child rearing and education: The okugatasama played a vital role in nurturing their children, both physically and mentally. They provided primary care and support, overseeing their children's health and overall well-being. In addition, they played an important role in the education of their children, passing on important moral and cultural values. Especially for daughters, the mother was responsible for teaching essential skills a woman needed for her future role as a samurai wife, such as etiquette, household management, manners, and appropriate behavior. They also needed to ensure that their sons received the necessary martial arts and military education to become successful samurai in their adult years. 3. Defending the home: It is essential to mention that, in some cases, samurai wives were responsible for defending the home when their husbands were away. They were often trained in martial arts, including the use of the naginata (a long pole weapon with a curved blade) and archery, to protect their homes and families against possible threats. The wives had to be prepared to fight, support their fellow samurai's spouses, and show courage in times of conflict or danger. In cases where the husband fell in battle or was incapacitated, the responsibility of heading the household could also fall upon the samurai wife. In conclusion, the sentence given does provide a valid answer to the question about the duties of samurai wives when their husbands were away. However, it only offers a brief overview of the various essential roles and responsibilities a samurai wife had to undertake in her husband's absence, which included household management, child-rearing, and home defense. These wives were trained, skilled, and resilient, playing an important role in maintaining the social and economic stability of the samurai household."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop RPG that allows players to create their own characters, embark on adventures, and engage in battles within a fantasy world. The game masters (also known as Dungeon Masters or DMs) are responsible for controlling and describing the world, providing challenges, and managing the story, which often includes a menagerie of monsters and creatures. The provided data specifically refers to Elemental creatures, which are a particular type of monster in the D&D universe. These creatures originate from the elemental planes, which are the foundational building blocks of the universe. Elementals can be comprised of many forms, most commonly embodying either earth, air, fire, or water. Some elementals can also arise from more obscure elements or combinations thereof. Elemental creatures can possess varying strengths and abilities depending on their elemental affinity. Within the detailed data, the mention of 'D&D Expert Rules (1981)' and 'D&D Expert Rules (1983)' hints at the appearance of Elemental creatures within these two rulebooks. It is likely that the authors of these rulebooks laid out essential guidelines on how to incorporate Elemental creatures into the game, such as their unique abilities, hit points, and game statistics. This information enables game masters to present engaging challenges to players when they encounter Elementals during play. Furthermore, the data lists the 'Rules Cyclopedia (1991)' as another source containing Elemental creatures. The Rules Cyclopedia is a comprehensive compilation of the D&D Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master rules that were released during the game's early edition years, consolidating them into a single tome. It covers information on how to create characters, how to play the game, and what creatures players may encounter. The inclusion of Elemental creatures in this sourcebook confirms their importance within the D&D universe as iconic and easily recognizable adversaries players might face in their adventures. The data also classifies Elementals as 'CREATURE_(OTHER_PLANES)', a label that further emphasizes the creature's origin. The term 'OTHER_PLANES' refers to the various planes of existence that exist within the multiverse of D&D; in the context of Elemental creatures, this indicates their connection to the elemental planes from which they hail. This distinction sets Elementals apart from other monster types that emerge from different planes, each with unique traits and characteristics. Overall, the given data highlights a list of Dungeons & Dragons monsters from 1977 to 1999, with a particular focus on Elemental creatures. These creatures inhabit the otherworldly planes associated with the game's core elements and have appeared in various rulebooks and source materials throughout the game's history.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"These two questions, although similar, are not asking the same thing. They both pertain to the valuation of a silver dollar, but the coins in question are from different years and may hold different values due to varying factors. I will address both questions separately to provide a clear understanding of each coin's value. Question 1: How do I determine the value of a 1985 silver dollar? To determine the value of a 1985 silver dollar, you should consider the following factors: 1. Mint location: Silver dollars may have been minted at different locations, which is usually denoted by a letter mintmark. The mintmark for Philadelphia is 'P', for Denver 'D', and for San Francisco 'S'. Coins minted in different locations may have different values. 2. Condition: The value of a coin often depends on its condition or grade. Uncirculated coins, meaning those that have not been in circulation, will usually be of higher value than circulated ones. The Sheldon Scale, which ranges from 1 (poor) to 70 (perfect mint condition), is commonly used to grade coins. 3. Rarity: A coin's rarity can also have a significant impact on its value. The mintage number or the number of coins produced can help to determine the rarity. 4. Metal composition: The metal content of the coin can also influence its worth. As of 1985, U.S. silver dollars were often made from a copper-nickel composition. However, some commemorative coins were produced with a higher silver content, which would increase their value. 5. Demand: Market demand for the coin and collectors' interest in the piece also play an essential role in determining its value. To get an accurate assessment of your 1985 silver dollar, you should consult price guides and online resources, or consult a professional coin dealer or appraiser. Question 2: What is a silver dollar from 1921 worth? The value of a 1921 silver dollar depends on the following factors: 1. Series: In 1921, there were two series of silver dollars: the Morgan Silver Dollar and the Peace Silver Dollar. The Peace Silver Dollar was only minted in high relief in that year, making it quite valuable. 2. Mint location: As mentioned previously, mintmarks indicating the coin's place of minting can influence its value. For the 1921 silver dollar, check for the mintmark 'P' for Philadelphia, 'D' for Denver, or 'S' for San Francisco. 3. Condition: The coin's state is crucial for its valuation, with higher grades corresponding to higher values. Look to the Sheldon Scale to grade your coin appropriately. 4. Rarity: The rarity of the coin will similarly impact its value. The number of coins minted and surviving examples are factors to consider when assessing rarity. 5. Metal composition: Both the Morgan Silver Dollar and the Peace Silver Dollar were composed of 90% silver and 10% copper, which will also contribute to their value. 6. Demand: As with the 1985 silver dollar, the market demand and collectors' interest can impact the coin's value. To determine the exact value of your 1921 silver dollar, consult price guides, online resources, or a professional coin dealer or appraiser."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ACTION1: Agreeing with my girlfriend's cousin and not her. This action involves interpersonal relationships.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Trudeau to be questioned over reports of fundraisers offering privileged access Justin Trudeau will be questioned by Canada’s ethics watchdog over reports of political fundraisers that allegedly offered privileged access to the prime minister and his cabinet ministers for a price. The development marks the first time in a decade that the ethics commissioner has questioned a sitting prime minister and is a turning point for Trudeau who swept to a majority government last year on broad promises to run a transparent administration that would abide by the highest standards of ethics. The scandal began brewing in October, after a series of media reports documented Liberal party fundraisers being held in the homes of wealthy Canadians and which offered access to members of Trudeau’s government for up to C1,500 (1,100) a ticket. The reports raised questions of whether the government was opening itself up to behind-the-scenes lobbying, such as a report by the Globe and Mail that quoted a British Columbia multimillionaire who said he had urged the prime minister to allow Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development just as the government was reviewing a bid by a China-based company to purchase a majority stake in one of British Columbia’s largest chains of retirement homes. The allegations, which have left Trudeau and his government fending off daily accusations of wrongdoing, triggered complaints to the ethics commissioner from the opposition Conservatives and the New Democratic party. Responding to the complaint from the Conservatives, Mary Dawson, Canada’s ethics commissioner said in a letter on Thursday that while there is no evidence to date to suggest that Trudeau violated the country’s conflict of interest act, she would query Trudeau over his involvement with the fundraising events. A copy of the letter was provided to the Guardian. Addressed to interim Conservative leader, Rona Ambrose, the letter noted Dawson’s unease over the issue. “While the information provided in support of the allegations is not sufficient to cause me to initiate an examination under the act at this time, your letter and media articles leave me with concerns in relation to Mr Trudeau’s interactions with individuals involved with the canola export agreement, Wealth One Bank and Anbang Insurance Group,” Dawson wrote. No timeline was given as to when she would question Trudeau. A spokesperson for the ethics commissioner confirmed that Dawson is looking into the matter and noted that it is the usual practice of the commissioner to follow up with questioning when the office receives a letter containing allegations. Based on the answers provided by the prime minister, the ethics commissioner will then determine whether a full-scale investigation should be launched. In late October, Canada’s lobbying commissioner announced it would launch an investigation into the fundraisers in order to determine whether any of the government rules around lobbying had been breached. The allegations of trading cash for access have come as a blow to Trudeau, as they appear to contradict accountability rules issued by the prime minister after his government came into power last year. The rules, which aim to go one step further than the fundraising rules that ban corporate and union donations and limit individual donations to a maximum of C1,500 annually, state “there should be no preferential access to government, or appearances of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organisations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties”. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trudeau said he would work with the ethics commissioner to answer any questions she may have. “We have very strict rules on fundraising at the federal level and no one is suggesting that we are not following those rules. And that’s something that is important for Canadians to remember,” he said. “Our commitment is to show the highest level of ethical standards, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” Earlier this week, Trudeau acknowledged that government business is discussed at the fundraisers – contrary to what officials from the Liberal party had previously told reporters – but insisted that donors have no special sway when it comes to government policy. Summary:","completion":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be questioned by the country’s ethics commissioner in relation to allegations that political fundraisers for his Liberal party offered privileged access to Trudeau and cabinet ministers in return for payments of up to CAD1,500 (1,100). Trudeau is the first sitting prime minister to be questioned in this way for a decade.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

Problem:Paragraph: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted Auwahi Wind Energy’s request to increase the number of allowed hoary bat deaths to 140 by 2037, The Maui News reported Friday. Auwahi Wind Energy submitted the amendments to the incidental take license and habitat conservation plan to federal and state agencies, officials said. The number is up from the 21 bats in its original permit received in 2012. The Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted the final environmental impact statement, the state department said. However, the federal decision must be published in the Federal Register to be made final. Auwahi was one of four Hawaii wind energy projects that applied for a federal permit, officials said. Its request was prepared and signed Sept. 3. The federal agency is expected to issue separate final decisions on each of the four requests through publication in the Federal Register, but the decisions have yet to be published. The risk that the wind turbines pose to bats in Hawaii “was largely unknown and underestimated,” Auwahi said in its original application. There is not enough information to determine the impact wind farms have on bat populations overall, experts confirmed. “We will certainly keep an eye on actual bat take numbers and oppose any additional increase in allowed take since there are known operational changes that would reduce the take to zero or close to it,” said Rob Weltman, president of the Sierra Club Maui Group. Auwahi experimented with changing turbine speeds, and fewer deaths at certain speeds were reported, Sierra Club officials said. Auwahi has worked to reforest bat habitat on Maui, sponsored U.S. Geological Survey bat research, conducted predator control and petrel burrow monitoring, and funded bat pens in the national park, the company said. American Electric Power acquired the west Maui wind farm from Sempra Renewables earlier this year, officials said. ___ Information from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com Claim: Hawaii wind farm allowed to increase incidental bat deaths. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. Usage: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted Auwahi Wind Energy’s request to increase the number of allowed hoary bat deaths to 140 by 2037. Explanation: This sentence directly supports the claim by stating that the authorities accepted the request to increase the allowed number of hoary bat deaths, providing evidence for the claim. Part #2: There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. Usage: Auwahi experimented with changing turbine speeds, and fewer deaths at certain speeds were reported, Sierra Club officials said. Explanation: Although there isn't a direct correlation to the claim about increasing the allowed bat deaths, this sentence shows that the company has tried to reduce the number of fatalities at certain turbine speeds, which indirectly supports the claim that it's trying to be environmentally responsible. Part #3: The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Usage: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted Auwahi Wind Energy’s request to increase the number of allowed hoary bat deaths to 140 by 2037. These authorities approved the amendments to the incidental take license and habitat conservation plan despite the increase from 21 bats in its original permit. This development confirms the claim that the Hawaii wind farm is allowed to increase incidental bat deaths.

Iris woke up to the sweet aroma of pancakes wafting from the kitchen, her favorite. The first part of the day went by as usual, her mom being extra careful not to give the surprise away. Iris frolicked about, blissfully unaware of the epic soirée waiting for her later in the day. As the day wore on, her mom prepared to 'run some errands,' taking Iris to her grandmother's house. Little did Iris know, this was the perfect strategy to allow time for her mom and helpers to set up the house for the party. Iris's friends, already clued in, began to arrive one by one at the agreed time. Colorful streamers hung from the ceiling, balloons adorned every free corner, and the heavenly scent of freshly baked cake snaked its way around the house. An aura of excitement permeated the atmosphere as everyone waited for the guest of honor to arrive. Upon her return, the twinkle in Iris's eyes outshone her glittery birthday tiara, astonished to see the transformation her house had undergone. A chorus of \\"Happy Birthday\\" engulfed her as she stood awestruck at the doorway. Iris was in a paradise of her own, surrounded by her friends, family, and a pile of wrapped presents that were just waiting for her tiny hands to rip them open. Navigating through the crowd of hugs and birthday wishes, Iris finally made her way towards the mountain of gifts. Excitement bubbled within her as she tore apart the first wrapping paper, revealing a set of beautifully illustrated children's books. She smiled wide, her eyes sparkling with delight. Her friends looked on, their hearts filled with joy seeing Iris so happy. This excitement persisted through each gift. Stuffed animals, craft supplies, puzzles, dresses - each present was more exciting than the last. But oh, the pièce de résistance of the evening was yet to come. Following the frenzy of presents, it was time for the birthday cake. Iris’s mother wheeled in a majestic princess cake, topped with five little candles. Iris's eyes were sparkling with anticipation, her hands eagerly twitching to cut the cake. She took a deep breath, blew the candles, and with a gleam in her eyes, she sliced the cake. Her friends echoed her giggles, their laughter filling the room as they indulged in the delicious cake. As night fell, the children left one by one, each carrying a small return gift, their faces beaming with joy. Iris, though tired, could not wipe the smile off her face. Her fifth birthday was indeed memorable, filled with love, surprises, and a room full of friends. As the excitement of the day dwindled down, Iris drifted off to sleep, her dreams filled with the day's events and the memories she had made. The house fell silent, yet echoing with the residual happiness, touched by the magical birthday party that her mom had so lovingly planned for Iris."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The original equation is: 34*j + 332 - 92 = 14*j First, let's simplify the left side of the equation by combining the constants. Subtract 92 from 332 to get 240. The equation then becomes: 34*j + 240 = 14*j Now we need to get all the terms with 'j' on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side. We'd do this by subtracting 14*j from both sides of the equation. Subtracting 14*j from 34*j leaves us with: (34-14)*j + 240 = 0 or, 20*j + 240 = 0 Next, we solve for 'j' by subtracting the constant term from both sides: 20*j = -240 Lastly, to isolate 'j', we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'j', which is 20: j = -240 / 20 So, j = -12 So, the solution to the equation 34*j + 332 - 92 = 14*j is j = -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - West Point is the oldest continuously occupied military post in the United States. West Point was established in 1775 by George Washington who considered it the most important strategic position in America. Until January 1778, West Point was not occupied by the military. On January 27, 1778, Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and his brigade crossed the ice on the Hudson River and climbed to the plain on West Point and from that day to the present, West Point has been occupied by the United States Army. It comprises approximately including the campus of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which is also frequently called \\"West Point\\". It is a Census Designated Place (CDP) located in the Town of Highlands in Orange County, New York, located on the western bank of the Hudson River. The population was 6,763 at the 2010 census. It is part of the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. - The high-water mark of the Confederacy refers to an area on Cemetery Ridge near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, marking the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863. Similar to a high water mark of water, the term is a reference to arguably the Confederate Army's best chance of achieving victory in the war. The line of advance was east of \\"The Angle\\" stone wall at various distances, e.g., the Virginians pushed the Union line back. - Jeffry D. Wert (born May 8, 1946) is an American historian and author specializing in the American Civil War. He has written several books on the subject, which have been published in multiple languages and countries. - Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \\"the captain of the men of death\\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \\"the old man's friend\\". - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson (January 21, 1824 May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War, and the best-known Confederate commander after General Robert E. Lee. His military career includes the Valley Campaign of 1862 and his service as a corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia, under Robert E. Lee. Confederate pickets accidentally shot him at the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863. The general survived but lost an arm to amputation; he died of complications from pneumonia eight days later. His death was a severe setback for the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the morale of its army and of the general public. Jackson in death became an icon of Southern heroism and commitment, and became a mainstay in the pantheon of the \\"Lost Cause\\". - The Battle of Gettysburg (with an sound) was fought July 13, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's attempt to invade the North. - The United States Military Academy ( USMA ) is an undergraduate college in West Point , New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army . Confederate President Jefferson Davis , himself a former officer and West Point graduate ( class of 1828 ) , preferred West Point trained officers for the Confederate States Army ( CSA ) . This article lists those alumni . Also included are a number of officers who were cadets at West Point but for reason unknown never graduated , such as Lewis Armistead . There are several ( indicated ) familiar relations between the officers , so we e.g. have several members of the Lee family of Virginia . Other notable Confederate officers include James Longstreet ( class of 1842 ) , Stonewall Jackson ( class of 1846 ) , and J.E.B. Stuart ( class of 1854 ) . - The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War, and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville Campaign. It was fought from April 30 to May 6, 1863, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near the village of Chancellorsville. Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size, General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Chancellorsville is known as Lee's \\"perfect battle\\" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory. The victory, a product of Lee's audacity and Hooker's timid decision making, was tempered by heavy casualties and the mortal wounding of Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson by friendly fire, a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm. - A field hospital is a small mobile medical unit, or mini hospital, that temporarily takes care of casualties on-site before they can be safely transported to more permanent hospital facilities. This term is used overwhelmingly with reference to military situations, but may also be used in times of disaster. The concept was inherited from the battlefield (such as the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital or MASH), and is now applied in case of disasters or major accidents, as well as with traditional Military medicine. - Orange County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 372,813. The county seat is Goshen. This county was first created in 1683 and reorganized with its present boundaries in 1798. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - A brigade is a major tactical military formation that is typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements. It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. Two or more brigades may constitute a division. - The Hudson River is a river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord, which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy. - Col. Richard Lee I (16171664), later nicknamed \\"The Immigrant\\" was the first member of the Lee family to live in America; he emigrated from Shropshire, England to Virginia in 1639. Lee was a lawyer, planter, soldier, politician, and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - Pickett's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Union positions on Cemetery Ridge on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. - The President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 October 12, 1870) was an American general known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until his surrender in 1865. The son of Revolutionary War officer Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the MexicanAmerican War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - Braxton Bragg (March 22, 1817 September 27, 1876) was a career United States Army officer, and then a general in the Confederate States Armya principal commander in the Western Theater of the American Civil War and later the military advisor to the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The Army of Tennessee was the principal Confederate army operating between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River during the American Civil War. It was formed in late 1862 and fought until the end of the war in 1865, participating in most of the significant battles in the Western Theater. It should not be confused with the Union Army of the Tennessee, named after the Tennessee River. - Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation, a congenital disorder, where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. Unlike some non-mammalian animals (such as lizards that shed their tails, salamanders that can regrow many missing body parts, and hydras, flatworms, and starfish that can regrow entire bodies from small fragments), once removed, human extremities do not grow back, unlike portions of some organs, such as the liver. A transplant or a prosthesis are the only options for recovering the loss. - The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary military force of the Confederate States of America in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War, as well as the primary command structure of the Department of Northern Virginia. It was most often arrayed against the Union Army of the Potomac. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - James Longstreet (January 8, 1821January 2, 1904) was one of the foremost Confederate generals of the American Civil War and the principal subordinate to General Robert E. Lee, who called him his \\"Old War Horse.\\" He served under Lee as a corps commander for many of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, but also with Gen. Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater. Biographer and historian Jeffry D. Wert wrote that \\"Longstreet ... was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.\\" - Jefferson Finis Davis (June 3, 1808 December 6, 1889) was an American politician who was a U.S. Representative and Senator from Mississippi, the 23rd U.S. Secretary of War, and the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He took personal charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to defeat the more populous and industrialized Union. His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country, and at home, the collapsing Confederate economy forced his government to print more and more paper money to cover the war's expenses, leading to runaway inflation and devaluation of the Confederate dollar. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - The Lee family of the United States is a historically significant Virginia and Maryland political family, whose many prominent members are known for their accomplishments in politics and the military.

In March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a more permanent Confederate States Army. - Lewis Addison Armistead (February 18, 1817 July 5, 1863) was a career United States Army officer who became a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. On July 3, 1863, as part of Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead led his brigade to the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during the charge, a point now referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. However, he and his men were overwhelmed, and he was wounded and captured by Union troops; he died in a field hospital two days later. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America.

Richard John Santorum (born May 10, 1958) is an American attorney, author, politician, and CNN Senior Political Commentator. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007 and was the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007. He ran as a candidate for the 2012 Republican Party presidential nomination, finishing second to Mitt Romney. Santorum was elected as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania in 1994. Santorum served in the United States Senate representing Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. From 2001 until 2007, he was the Senate's third-ranking Republican. He was first elected to the Senate during the 1994 Republican takeover, narrowly defeating incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford, 49% to 47%. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was \\"Join the Fight!\\" During the race, he was considered an underdog, as his opponent was 32 years his senior. He was reelected in 2000, defeating U.S. Congressman Ron Klink by a 52-46% margin. In his reelection bid of 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59-41% margin. After his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to \\"practice what [he] preached\\" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid. In 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill. In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican Arlen Specter in his short-lived campaign for president. Reporters have observed that though Santorum and Specter differed on social policy, Specter provided him with key political staff for his successful run in 1994. The National Taxpayers Union, a fiscal conservative organization, gave Santorum an \\"A-\\" score for his votes on fiscal issues, meaning that he was one of \\"the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies\\" during his tenure, and ranked fifth in the group's rankings out of 50 senators who served at the same time. Did he make a big impact?","completion":"Richard John Santorum made a significant impact in his time as a United States Senator and in his pursuit of the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2012. Some of the ways he made an impact include: 1. Welfare Reform: As the Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform in 1996, Santorum contributed to the legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. This reform represented a major overhaul of the welfare system in the United States, and his leadership in the effort highlights his influence in this area. 2. Fiscal Responsibility: Santorum's \\"A-\\" score from the National Taxpayers Union demonstrates his commitment to responsible tax and spending policies. Ranking fifth among 50 senators in this regard, it is evident that Santorum played a crucial role in supporting fiscal conservatism during his time in office. 3. Influence on his party: Santorum's ability to serve as the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007 demonstrates his influence within the Republican Party. Additionally, his 2012 presidential campaign, in which he finished second to Mitt Romney, also shows the impact he made on the political landscape and within his party. 4. Advocacy on social issues: While serving in the Senate, Santorum was a prominent voice on socially conservative issues such as opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights. He used his platform to advocate for his views on these matters, which resonated with many conservative voters and shaped public discourse on these subjects. In summary, Richard John Santorum made a substantial impact during his time as a United States Senator, as well as in his pursuit of the presidency in 2012. His influence on welfare reform, fiscal responsibility, the Republican Party, and social issues showcase the ways he contributed to American politics and policymaking during his tenure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But the tragic death of Australian batsman Phil Hughes has prompted the \\"gentlemen's game\\" to ask itself serious and searching questions about safety. The 25-year-old was struck on the head by a ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott during a state match in Sydney and died on Thursday from his injuries. Tributes have flooded in for Hughes but the cricket family has also shown acute concern for Abbott, who, at just 22, has been shattered by his inadvertent role in a former teammate's death.

It's crucial for Abbott to persevere through the inevitable emotional turmoil and focus on his love for the game that has driven him this far. Former players and coaches can offer their expertise to help him regain his confidence and gradually reintegrate into competitive cricket. By working closely with other players, acknowledging and learning from the past, and implementing enhanced safety protocols, both Abbott and the cricket world can use this tragedy as an opportunity for growth and positive change. With the right approach and mindset, there's hope that Abbott can continue pursuing his passion and eventually rebuild the promising career that lies ahead of him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Is it necessary for a young man to have an apartment as a prerequisite for marriage? Housing has become a major obstacle for Chinese young men hoping to start a family. China may breed a new group of bachelors, men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses. Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority and that women see an apartment as essential to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas. Social housing, provided by European authorities, offer the less wealthy people their own piece of real estate. Such housing is usually apartments in tall buildings with 10 or more floors on the _ of town, whose main advantage is the low rents. For many Americans, houses don't pose an obstacle to getting married. They often buy a house after the wedding, because more and more people are reconsidering their real estate worship, and going back to a more rational mode of consumption. In Japan, renting is the custom for newly married young couples. Few young couples can afford to purchase property. Up to 67.1 percent of young couples choose to rent. Generally speaking, renters account for most... Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the text? Options: A: Home prices have been extremely high since early 2009.

L'église y est comme il se doit, pervertie et inféodée au Pouvoir, l'homosexualité, synonyme d'intelligence et d'ouverture d'esprit est persécutée, et le Coran constitue la relique émouvante d'une culture bannie.

Il n'hésite pas « pour la bonne cause », à tuer, brutaliser, terroriser, ou à faire sauter joyeusement les symboles même de la démocratie que sont le Parlement et le Palais de Justice en se servant du métro pour véhiculer ses bombes... Au final le sentiment qui domine, c'est celui d'assister à une farce sinistre qui s'épuise en bavardages sentencieux et invraisemblances ridicules.

In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which group tended to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers? Concurrently with designing churches and building railways, Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering sanitary reform. By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission. He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a \\"chief magistrate\\". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor housing, open sewers, overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration. Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including \\"cleansing, lighting and watching\\" the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers. The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Why we won’t have tablet-native journalism Last week, when the Daily died, I declared that the reason, in part, was that tablet-native journalism was impossible. And I got a lot of rather vehement pushback, including some smart commentary from John Gruber, taking the other side of the argument. That most existing iPad magazine apps are slow, badly-designed, can’t search, etc. does not mean iPad magazine apps cannot be fast, well-designed, and searchable. Salmon says “This wasn’t The Daily’s fault” but he’s 180 degrees wrong. All of these problems were entirely The Daily’s fault. All impossible tasks have not been accomplished; but not all tasks that have not yet been accomplished are impossible. When it comes to media, what strikes many as The Daily’s cardinal sin is eschewing the open Web for the closed garden of a subscriber-only iOS app. The idea being that you can’t win without a web-first strategy. But that’s what “everyone” said about social networks too — until Instagram came along and became a sensation with an iPhone-only strategy. I’ve since talked about this issue at some length, with both David Jacobs of 29th Street Publishing — someone who specializes in developing iPad-native apps — and with Ben Jackson, another one of my critics. And I still think that tablet-native journalism is an idea which isn’t going to take off any time soon. Gruber’s point, which Jackson also made, is that you can’t tar an entire platform with a few bad apps. Maybe The Daily was bad; maybe lots of Condé Nast apps are bad; maybe the people selling ads on iPad apps are responsible for degrading the experience of using them so as to maximize ad revenues. But in theory, all of these problems can be overcome — and in fact, in practice, many of the problems I cited in my post have already been overcome, at least by one or two publishers. (For instance, the Businessweek app does have search, and the NYT app will let you start reading stories before the whole thing has downloaded.) Be that as it may be, however, no one’s been able to convince me that there even is such a thing as tablet-native journalism, let alone that it has any chance of really taking off. Certainly there’s lots of journalism which appears on tablets, and sometimes even exclusively on tablets. The Magazine, from Marco Arment, is the most cited, but one might also point to (what’s left of) Newsweek, where something called Newsweek Global “will be supported by paid subscription” and available on tablets. In both cases, however, the main reason for moving to the tablet seems to be revenue-related: it’s just vastly easier to charge for subscriptions on a tablet than it is on the web, and Newsweek needs to have a subscription product, to prevent itself from being forced to refund all the money it’s already been paid by print subscribers. And if The Magazine is really the best thing we’ve found so far in the tablet-journalism space, that’s pretty depressing. For one thing, there’s pretty much zero journalism in it; it’s mostly first-person essays by Marco’s friends. And then there’s the fact that it deliberately abjures all the clever things that the iPad can do, opting instead for a very clean and simple interface: what Craig Mod calls “subcompact publishing”. Subcompact publishing helps in terms of making great writing immersive: there are no distractions, just text (and maybe the occasional link or illustration) on a white background. Once you get lost in the story, the medium becomes invisible, just like all great storytellers should. It’s taking journalism and doing to it much the same thing that Readability does, or Apple’s “Reader” button in Safari. But when all you have is text, the journalism itself isn’t really tablet-native: it doesn’t shape itself to the contours of the medium in the way that radio journalism does to radio, or TV journalism does to TV, or tabloid-magazine journalism does to tabloid magazines. You’re basically left with a high-tech means of reading the kind of thing which could have been written centuries ago. But Jacobs makes a good point: if you look at these publications at the story level, you’re missing something very important. Jacobs has worked on apps for websites like Gothamist and the Awl, where the content in the app is exactly the same as the free content on the website, but the way that content is presented is different in important ways. Websites need to be fresh and constantly-updated; apps can be a bit more curated. And importantly what’s not there makes a big difference: one of the great things about The Magazine is that each issue is an easily-digestible length. Marco has a lot of information, from Instapaper, about the stories people like to read on their tablets, and specifically how long the sweet spot is. Each issue of The Magazine, or the Awl’s Weekend Companion, is much shorter than the daunting downloads one might get from The Daily or Wired or Businessweek. These smaller apps are not trying to present everything; they’re acting as real editors, and serving up something much more digestible. In the case of the Awl, the value (4 per month) is actually in the way that the editors have subtracted a huge amount of the content available on the website. Similarly, Matter publishes just one article at a time, and doesn’t even force you to use its own app: you can call it up online and then read it using Instapaper, if you like. So my feeling is that insofar as tablet journalism is going to have any success in the foreseeable future, you’re not going to see it in elaborate downloads with glossy production values. Jackson made this point: every time someone demonstrates ability in putting together great, intuitive iOS applications, they tend to be hired (or acqu-hired) very quickly by some big company like Facebook or Google. Radio journalists know how to edit radio shows, and TV producers can put together TV shows, but there are basically no journalists who can produce an iOS app to tell the stories they want to tell, and the coders they might conceivably work with, as part of a team, tend not to work for news-media organizations. Instead, we’re going to see universal journalism, which can be accessed — and possibly edited — in different ways on different devices. It might be free on the web, for instance, while costing a couple of bucks in the form of a simple iOS app. Maybe it will only be available on iOS, but for business-model reasons, not because it couldn’t work on the web. Or maybe, as in the case of Matter, it will be available in any format you like, for a single flat price. I’m quite excited about what Ev is doing at Medium, in terms of creating a new and intuitive way of writing online — it’s long past time that we managed to move away from the evil tyranny of Word. And then, once a Medium post has been created, it looks great on any device. That’s the future, I think: write once, look great anywhere. Rather than anything tablet-specific.

Options: - store - office - cuba - photographs - pond The answer is \\"pond\\" because A:","completion":"Jellyfish can be found in various aquatic environments, including ponds, as well as oceans, seas, and even some freshwater bodies of water. While it's accurate to say you can find jellyfish in a pond, it's essential to provide further context and information to better understand this answer. Jellyfish are members of the phylum Cnidaria and class Scyphozoa, known for their bell-shaped body and gelatinous appearance. Typically, jellyfish reside in saltwater environments such as oceans and seas, where they can be found at various depths, from shallow coastal waters to deep ocean regions. This means finding jellyfish in Cuba's waters, a Caribbean Island, is highly plausible. However, you can also find jellyfish in freshwater and brackish environments, such as ponds. This is mostly applicable to a unique and rare species of jellyfish called Craspedacusta sowerbii or the freshwater jellyfish. The species is small, with a translucent appearance, and is native to China's Yangtze River Basin. Due to its invasive nature, it has spread to other parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Australia, where it has been found in ponds, reservoirs, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Although the given options include a store and an office, jellyfish are not naturally found in these environments unless they are held in an aquarium for educational or aesthetic purposes. As for photographs, one can find images of various jellyfish species within books, magazines, or online, it's not their natural habitat. In conclusion, the answer being \\"pond\\" is justified since some jellyfish species can be found in freshwater bodies of water like ponds. It's essential to note that the presence of jellyfish in a pond may vary depending on the region, species, and specific environmental conditions.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

Please answer this question: In Christianity, ‘Holy Wednesday’ is also known as ‘what’ Wednesday?","completion":"In Christianity, Holy Wednesday is also known as Spy Wednesday. This day, traditionally observed within the Holy Week, carries special significance in the Christian liturgy, as it commemorates the betrayal of Jesus Christ by one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot. The name 'Spy Wednesday' alludes to the act of espionage committed by Judas when he made a secret deal with the religious authorities to betray Jesus in exchange for 30 pieces of silver. Holy Week, in general, refers to the week preceding Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The week begins with Palm Sunday, followed by Holy Monday, Holy Tuesday, Spy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday (also known as Holy Thursday), Good Friday, and Holy Saturday, culminating in the joyous celebration of Easter Sunday. Spy Wednesday holds special significance because it serves as a reminder of human fallibility and the consequences of betrayal. In the biblical narrative, Judas' decision to betray Jesus set in motion a series of events that led to the crucifixion. These events are crucial to the Christian faith, as the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus form the cornerstone of Christianity, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice and triumph over sin and death. During Holy Week, many Christians attend special church services that commemorate and reflect on the events leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. On Spy Wednesday, services may focus on Judas Iscariot's betrayal and the role that his actions played in the unfolding of Jesus' Passion. In some Christian traditions, particularly those of Greek Orthodox and Eastern origin, Holy Wednesday is also known as Holy and Great Wednesday. In these traditions, the day is not characterized by the theme of betrayal and espionage but is rather marked by their focus on the healing power of Jesus' divine presence. The Orthodox Church emphasizes Jesus' act of forgiving the repentant woman who anoints his feet with oil and wipes them with her hair in preparation for his burial. This act, along with the sacrament of Holy Unction, commemorates Jesus' selfless and redemptive love and serves as a reminder of the healing available to all who seek it. In summary, Holy Wednesday in Christianity is also known as Spy Wednesday due to the betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas Iscariot. It is an important day within Holy Week as it symbolizes human fallibility and serves as a reminder of the consequences of betrayal. Christians around the world observe this day with solemn reflection and participate in services that highlight the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. In some traditions, the day commemorates Jesus' healing and forgiveness, emphasizing the divine and redemptive nature of his love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

See options at the end We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the Options: (i) tomboy was inanimate.; (ii) plane was inanimate.;","completion":"We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. While both the tomboy and the plane are interesting subjects, our focus in this particular story was to develop rich and multifaceted characters with personal struggles, aspirations, and growth. Since a tomboy is a human character, she can induce emotions and empathy in the audience, allowing for a more engaging story. Concentrating on a human character like the tomboy offers numerous benefits compared to highlighting an inanimate object like the plane. Firstly, human characters have emotions, thoughts, and different perspectives, enabling us to create a more diverse and intricate narrative. The tomboy's character arc can be shaped by her experiences and interactions with other characters in the story, providing opportunities for the complexities of human relationships to be explored. This would be difficult to accomplish if the central character were an inanimate object like the plane, as it lacks emotions and the ability to communicate through speech. Secondly, it is easier for readers to relate to and empathize with human characters. Audiences find it easier to become emotionally invested in a story when they can find aspects of their own lives mirrored in the characters. In the case of the tomboy, readers might identify with her struggles to find her identity, cope with societal expectations, or forge meaningful relationships with those around her. This emotional resonance might be lost if the plane were at the center of the story, as it would be more challenging to convey its significance to readers in a relatable manner. Furthermore, concentrating on the tomboy allows for a richer exploration of themes and messages. Human characters are capable of growth, change, and development over time, which encourages them to confront their flaws, learn from their mistakes, and persevere in the face of adversity. Such character arcs inspire readers and provoke thought about our own capacity for growth and transformation. But when we focus on an inanimate object like the plane, these themes of personal growth and resilience can become diluted or lost altogether. On the other hand, the plane could still play a vital role in the story. As a backdrop or plot device, the plane can contribute to the story's setting, create conflict for the characters, and shape the course of the narrative. For example, it could serve as a means of transportation for the tomboy on a life-changing journey, or as a potent symbol of her yearning for freedom and escape from societal pressures. In conclusion, we opted to write about the tomboy instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. It was crucial for our story to have a character that could engage the reader emotionally through relatable experiences and personal growth. The tomboy offered the depth and complexity that our narrative demanded, while the plane remained a valuable supporting element in the story. Overall, we believed this choice would create a more captivating and thought-provoking story for our audience to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I'm know 21 so I'm going to count that still as a kid because the world is still new to me. I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body. The building was closed for around a day and a half they had to repaint and do all sorts of things because of so much blood. Ill say they do not train you for seeing such horrible things or even mention that it can happen I'm lucky enough to have a strong head and can handle seeing such horror. Of course Im not 100% OK from it and now keep a close eye on the bathrooms. But I'm OK enough to continue working and only saw a psychologist twice about it. So yea that's the worst thing I have seen In my life. Question: What did the author probably do after the scene? Answer: Answer:","completion":"After the scene, the author likely continued their job as a security personnel but kept a closer eye on the bathrooms. They also sought professional help by seeing a psychologist twice to process the traumatic event and its impact on their well-being. Despite not being 100% OK from the experience, the author was able to continue working and manage the situation with a strong mindset."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Labour leader said he was \\"appalled\\" that after offering him a right of reply, the paper had repeated its original article and also now \\"described my father's legacy as evil\\". He said it raised questions about morality and boundaries for newspapers. The Mail says it will not apologise and stands by the story. However, its deputy editor later said it was an \\"error of judgement\\" for the paper to have published a picture of Ralph Miliband's grave on the website version of the story, prompting the Labour leader to say the newspaper \\"should now apologise\\". In Saturday's article, journalist Geoffrey Levy questioned how the beliefs of Ralph Miliband, a Marxist academic who died in 1994, may have influenced the Labour leader and his brother, former Foreign Secretary David Miliband. It highlighted a diary entry Ralph Miliband wrote at the age of 17 saying that the English were \\"perhaps the most nationalist people in the world... you sometimes want them almost to lose [the war] to show them how things are\\". The paper goes on to say \\"how passionately he would have approved today of his son's sinister warning about some of the policies he plans to follow if he ever becomes prime minister\\". In his piece in Tuesday's edition, Ed Miliband says his father, a Jewish refugee who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis, \\"loved\\" Britain and served in the Navy. He says: \\"There is no credible argument in the article or evidence from [Ralph Miliband's] life which can remotely justify the lurid headline and its accompanying claim that it would 'disturb everyone who loves this country'.\\" He says Britain \\"was a source of hope and comfort for him, not hatred\\". \\"Fierce debate about politics does not justify character assassination of my father, questioning the patriotism of a man who risked his life for our country in the Second World War,\\" Mr Miliband says. He says the diary entry described the \\"suspicion he found of the Continent and the French when he arrived here\\". \\"To ignore his service and work in Britain and build an entire case about him hating our country on an adolescent diary entry is, of course, absurd.\\" Mr Miliband says his father joined the Navy as he \\"was determined to be part of the fight against the Nazis and to help his family hidden in Belgium. He was fighting for Britain.\\" He adds: \\"My father's strongly left-wing views are well known, as is the fact that I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision. \\"The idea of me being part of some 'sinister' Marxist plot would have amused him and disappointed him in equal measure and for the same reason - he would have known it was ludicrously untrue. I want to make capitalism work for working people, not destroy it.\\" Later, in an interview with reporters, Mr Miliband said it was \\"perfectly legitimate\\" for newspapers to discuss his father's politics. But he said: \\"I was appalled when I read the Daily Mail on Saturday and I saw them say he hated Britain. It's a lie.\\" The Daily Mail's editorial on Tuesday - published alongside Mr Miliband's response and an abridged version of the original article - is headlined \\"an evil legacy and why we won't apologise\\". Mr Miliband said: \\"I'm even more appalled that they repeated that lie today and they've gone further and described my father's legacy as evil. Evil is a word reserved for particular cases and I wasn't willing to let that stand.\\" He added that there were \\"boundaries\\" that newspapers should adhere to. \\"It's not about regulation... but it is about me saying I think morality and our approach to these things matters.\\" He added that his brother and mother felt the same way he did about what the newspaper had said. The Mail's editorial said it stood by \\"every word\\" of the article. \\"We do not maintain... that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different,\\" it said. It suggested that Mr Miliband's plans to freeze energy prices and give councils powers to purchase land from developers, and his support for press regulation backed by law, were signs of his \\"own Marxist values\\". It later said in a statement: \\"We ask fair-minded people to read our editorial today. For what this episode confirms is that you cannot allow politicians anywhere near regulating the press. \\"While we respect Mr Miliband's right to defend his father... it is worth stressing that Ralph Miliband wasn't an ordinary private individual but a prominent academic and author who devoted his life to promoting a Marxist dogma which caused so much misery in the world. \\"He hated such British institutions as the Queen, the Church and the Army, and wanted a workers' revolution. Our readers have a right to know that.\\" Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Daily Mail assistant editor Jon Steafel said the picture of Ralph Miliband's grave, which included the caption \\"grave socialist\\", was removed after he personally took a call from Ed Miliband. But he continued to defend the article and headline itself as \\"entirely justified\\". Alastair Campbell, the former director of communications at Downing Street under Tony Blair, said the Daily Mail was \\"the worst of British values posing as the best\\" and its editor Paul Dacre should have appeared on Newsnight himself to defend the article. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: \\"We continue to believe that the article... and a subsequent article... were smears. The deputy editor of the Daily Mail showed tonight he could not justify either of them.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron was asked about the row on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, but said he had not read the original article or the response from the Labour leader. He added, though, that \\"if anyone had a go at my father I would want to respond vigorously\\" so totally \\"understand what Ed's done\\". The prime minister later rejected any comparison between attacks by Conservative-supporting newspapers on Labour politicians and smear campaigns led by Gordon Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride as \\" frankly ludicrous\\". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he supported the Labour leader, tweeting: \\"Politics should be about playing the ball, not the man, certainly not the man's family.\\" But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt challenged Ed Miliband to distance himself from his father's views on capitalism, saying \\"Ralph Miliband was no friend of the free market economy... I've never heard Ed Miliband say he supports the free market economy.\\" In a statement, the Labour Party said: \\"Ed Miliband wrote his right to reply article because he wanted to state clearly that his father loved Britain. \\"He wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late father's reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father... the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further.\\"","completion":"Labour leader Ed Miliband criticized the Daily Mail for publishing an article that claimed his father, Ralph Miliband, hated Britain and portrayed his legacy as evil. The paper refused to apologize and stood by the story, though its deputy editor admitted that including a picture of Ralph Miliband's grave on the website version of the story was an \\"error of judgement.\\" Ed Miliband responded to the article in a piece for the newspaper, highlighting his father's service in the Navy and defending his own political views as different from his father's. He called the article a lie, questioning its morality and boundaries."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by.

After snapping their three-game losing streak against the Seattle Seahawks the weekend before, the Packers returned home to face their first AFC opponent of the season, the 2007 AFC South Champion Indianapolis Colts. The game started with the Packers in possession and the Packers started off the game with a nice 14-yard run by RB Ryan Grant for a first down. On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards.

During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half.

DT Ryan Pickett batted down the pass intended for Marvin Harrison on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt. With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33-yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB Brandon Jackson for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18-yard line and took a time out with 9&#160;seconds left. Mason Crosby attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game. In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15.

RB Dominic Rhodes rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14. The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker Adam Vinatieri instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by Charles Woodson. Ryan Grant rushed for 9&#160;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two Aaron Rodgers kneel downs sealed the dominating victory.

Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the year 632, after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \\"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose beau's father forbids his son to associate with the Griffith family? Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many. To impress his six-year-old daughter Corinne, he spends the family's savings to buy his own circus, simply so the little girl can have her own pony. His elder daughter Augusta becomes distraught as her father makes some questionable business deals under the influence of alcohol. This causes strife within the Griffith household and makes her beau's father (the local bank president) forbid his son to associate with the Griffith family. After his squandering leaves the Griffiths in debt, wife Ambolyn packs up Augusta and Corinne and moves to Texarkana, Texas, where her father, Anthony Ghio, is the mayor. Griffith attempts to use his circus to help Ghio's bid for reelection, but accidentally causes Ambolyn to end up with a broken hand. Despondent, he leaves for Louisiana and is little seen or heard from by the family. Talked into an attempt at reconciliation, Papa is reluctant, believing the Griffiths want nothing more to do with him, but he is welcomed back with open arms.

He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity of an artist.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Please answer this question : Which jogger experienced less nausea? A:","completion":"There isn't enough information provided on Ted's situation and whether or not he experienced any nausea while jogging. However, we know that Randy had an unpleasant episode that led to him passing out and being taken to the hospital. It is likely that Randy experienced nausea during this episode because nausea is an early symptom of electrolyte deficiency, which Randy likely suffered from while jogging in the heat without water or supplements. Without further information on Ted, we can't definitively compare his experience to Randy's, so it's not possible to definitively answer which jogger experienced less nausea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? I am sure it takes somone knows nothing about farming to predict accurately looks at risk for an upcoming year and then design an assistance program which actually extends more help to the farmers in neighbouring provinces than the farmers that actually need it.","completion":"Based on the initial paragraph, it appears that the author is expressing a sense of irony or sarcasm when referring to a \\"particular form of genius.\\" The author essentially implies that the individual or system responsible for predicting provinces most at risk and designing assistance programs has failed, providing more support to farmers in neighboring provinces rather than those who actually need it. However, the rephrased sentence you provided, \\"I am sure it takes someone (sic) knows nothing about farming to predict accurately looks at risk for an upcoming year and then design an assistance program which actually extends more help to the farmers in neighbouring provinces than the farmers that actually need it,\\" is not entirely accurate when compared to the initial paragraph. The statement in the rephrased sentence explicitly suggests that someone with no knowledge of farming is responsible for this inaccurate prediction and assistance program design, which may not be the case. The original paragraph does criticize the individual or system in question, but it does so sarcastically by referring to a \\"particular form of genius\\" rather than directly stating their incompetence. In the rephrased sentence, the criticism is direct and harsher, asserting that someone who \\"knows nothing about farming\\" is responsible. This slight difference in tone impacts the overall meaning and connotation of the two sentences. In conclusion, while both sentences express criticism of the individual or system responsible for predicting at-risk provinces and designing assistance programs, they do so in different ways. The initial paragraph uses sarcasm to imply that the individual or system has failed, while the rephrased sentence directly states that someone with no knowledge of farming is the reason for the failure. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to conclude that the rephrased sentence is true based solely on the initial paragraph."},{"prompt":"Question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki. What is an example of International Style? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The International Style emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the need for simplicity, functionality, and a departure from historic architectural traditions. It emphasized rationality, the use of new materials and technologies, and the pursuit of a universally applicable design. The Seagram Building in New York City, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, is an excellent example of the International Style. Completed in 1958, the Seagram Building is a 38-story high-rise office tower located on Park Avenue. The structure embodies the International Style's key principles, such as minimalism, an emphasis on straight lines and geometrical forms, and the incorporation of steel and glass in its construction. The use of these materials not only simplified the design process but also allowed for the creation of large open spaces, a fundamental aspect of the International Style. The Seagram Building has a steel frame supported by large vertical steel columns, while the outer façade is made of glass and bronze. This was a pioneering effort in the use of curtain wall systems, in which the outer envelope is non-load bearing and functions solely as a protective skin. The innovative design not only provided a sleek, unadorned exterior but also maximized the natural light entering the building, thus increasing energy efficiency. One of the defining features of the International Style is the concept of “form follows function,” which means that buildings should prioritize utility and efficiency over ornamentation. The Seagram Building exemplifies this principle, as its design is rooted in the desire for an efficient, functional workspace. The simple rectangular form, with its open floor plans, allowed for maximum flexibility in interior design while also promoting a sense of openness and cohesion for the occupants. Additionally, the Seagram Building incorporates elements of urban design that were part of the International Style's philosophy. The generous plaza space in front of the building serves as an urban oasis and gathering space, a break from the dense fabric of Manhattan. This is a reflection of the International Style's dedication to the integration of architecture and urban planning principles, with an emphasis on creating cohesive and functional spaces for the public. In summary, the Seagram Building, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, is a prime example of the International Style in architecture. Its minimalist design, innovative use of new materials and technologies, and emphasis on functionality exemplify the key principles of the style. The building has since become an iconic structure and has greatly influenced the design of high-rise office buildings around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Packers played at Lambeau Field for the second time in five days, a Thursday night game versus their divisional rivals, the Minnesota Vikings. The game was played on the third anniversary of the passing of Irv Favre, Brett Favre's father. In the first quarter, the Packers entered the red zone on each of their drives, but only scored once on a 38-yard field goal from kicker Dave Rayner. Rayner would miss his next two field goals. The Packers defence forced the Vikings to punt on all their possessions in the first half. The Packers scored on the final play of the half with a 44-yard field goal from Dave Rayner. In the third quarter cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson, marking his seventh interception of the season extending a career-high. Later in the third quarter, Brett Favre was intercepted by cornerback Fred Smoot. Smoot returned the interception into the end zone, gaining the first lead of the game for the Vikings. In the fourth quarter the Packers drove the ball into Vikings territory, but tight end Bubba Franks fumbled the ball at the two-yard line, turning possession over to the Vikings. The Packers drove the ball 41&#160;yards on their next possession to set Dave Rayner in position to attempt a field goal. Rayner made a 44-yard field goal with 1:34 left in the game to give the packers a 9-7 lead. The Vikings were unable to score on their last possession which granted the Packers their seventh win of the season. Despite scoring only nine points, the Packers recorded 19 first downs and 319 total yards. Brett Favre completed 26 of 50 passes, gaining 285&#160;yards. Favre also recorded two interceptions. Defensively, the Packers limited the Vikings to three total first downs and a 2-14 first down rate. The Vikings punted ten times in the game. Packers defensive end, Aaron Kampman had three sacks in the game. The game marked only the third time in NFL history when the losing team scored the only touchdown off a defensive turnover, the first coming from another 9-7 result at Lambeau Field between the Packers and Vikings with the Vikings beating the Packers in that contest. How many passes did Brett Favre not complete?","completion":"Brett Favre tried to throw 50 passes in that game, and he completed 26 of them. If we want to know how many passes he did not complete, we can subtract the completed passes from the total tried passes like this: 50 (total tried passes) - 26 (completed passes) = 24 (not completed passes) So, Brett Favre did not complete 24 passes in that game."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

What's more, you don't even need to touch the egg to get it to go in! For this experiment you will need: *a hard-boiled egg *a glass bottle with a mouth just slightly smaller than the egg (a fruit-drink bottle works well) *a 8-cm by 8-cm(3-inch by 3-inch)piece of newspaper *a match Remove the shell from the egg. Set the egg on the mouth of the bottle to see that the egg does not fit through the mouth. Light the paper. Remove the egg from the mouth of the bottle and drop the burning paper into the bottle. Before the fire goes out, set the egg back onto the mouth of the bottle. Within a few seconds the egg will squeeze through the mouth and into the bottle. As it entered the bottle, the egg may have broken into pieces. This happens when the diameter of the egg is more than about 0.5 cm(about 3/16 inch) larger than the diameter of the bottle's opening. Why does the egg slide into the bottle, even though no one is pushing it? Because the pressure of the air is pushing it. Before the burning paper is put into the bottle, the pressure of the air inside is the same as outside. The burning paper, however, heats the air inside. This causes the air inside to expand. When the egg is placed on top of the bottle, it seals the bottle. When the fire goes out, the air inside cools. As it cools, the air contracts , and the pressure of the air inside becomes less than the pressure outside. Then, the higher outside pressure pushes the egg into the bottle! Question: Why will the egg break into pieces while entering the bottle? Options: A: Because of the burning paper. B: Because the diameter of the egg is too larger than that of the bottles opening.

The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter, who was followed by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.Humphreys, a Naval captain, had married Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere.

It showcases emotional turmoil, conflict, and resilience in the face of adversity. The protagonist, Aliah, is experiencing the weight of her sister Eliana's legacy as well as her struggle with accepting that legacy and the beliefs associated with it. Let us dissect this segment for a deeper understanding. The text starts with the action of someone tapping the pendant on Aliah's neck. This simple action is powerful as it serves both as a physical reminder of the pendant's presence and a metaphorical reminder of the weight of her sister's legacy. This weight appears to lie heavy on Aliah, which amplifies the importance and emotional impact of the pendant. As the person taps the pendant, Aliah's own heartbeat betrays her anxiety. This anxiety lies beneath the surface, and the fear of stepping into her sister's shoes as well as reconciling with her identity is palpable. By feeling her heartbeat, the audience can empathize with her emotions and understand her struggles in grappling with her legacy. The tears that blur Aliah's vision add an additional layer of emotional intensity to this scene. Aliah's tears signify the overwhelming pain, sadness, and uncertainty she is experiencing due to her attachment to Eliana's pendant. The fact that tears blur her sight serves as a metaphor for her uncertain outlook on life as she questions her path, identity, and the beliefs forced upon her. Aliah's words \\"it's Eliana's pendant. Not mine. So how can it be my reality?\\" express her denial and resistance to accept the legacy and the belief system attached to the pendant. It also showcases a fierce need to maintain her own identity, separate from her sister. Aliah's argument that \\"no one can force their beliefs on me\\" underlines her refusal to bend to the expectations and ideologies of others, defying her circumstances to remain true to herself. In conclusion, this scene portrays a complex emotional struggle within Aliah as she navigates her sister's legacy, the pendant, and the beliefs surrounding it. Her fierce determination to retain her own identity and avoid submitting to others' beliefs highlights her strength of character and the intense emotions she experiences in her journey. The vivid imagery of the pendant tap, the pulsing heartbeat, and the tears blurring her vision combine to form a powerful scene that draws the reader into the protagonist's world, making them empathize with and understand her pain and defiance in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"so it's that dry heat\\" This sentence describes a weather condition that is both hot and dry. The word \\"that\\" implies it is a specific type of heat - one known for being dry. Sentence 2: \\"It's arid.\\" This sentence describes a condition, \\"arid\\", which means it relates to an environment or weather condition that lacks moisture or experiences very little rainfall (and is typically dry and hot). Step 2: Assess the relationship between the two sentences. Both sentences seem to be describing similar conditions - dryness and heat. The first sentence specifically mentions \\"dry heat\\", while the second one refers to an \\"arid\\" condition, which implies a dry and hot environment. Step 3: Evaluate if the second sentence is true when the first one is. By understanding that both sentences describe similar conditions of dryness and heat, it can be deduced that when Sentence 1 is true (meaning there is a \\"dry heat\\"), it is likely that Sentence 2 is also true (the weather described by Sentence 1 is \\"arid\\").

And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is most likely the author's occupation?

Thin crust: This term implies that the pizza dough is rolled out or stretched quite thinly, resulting in a crispy and crunchy crust. Thin crust pizzas are often contrasted with thick crust or deep-dish pizzas, which have a denser, bread-like texture. 2. Pizza: Pizza is a widely popular Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread base, typically topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients. The term \\"pizza\\" is crucial in this sentence as it designates the type of food being described. 3. Cheese: This term refers to the dairy product that serves as the primary topping on the described pizza. Cheese is an essential component of most pizzas and provides flavor, texture, and richness to the dish. The mention of \\"just cheese\\" highlights that no other toppings are present, indicating a focus on simplicity and the classic combination of cheese and tomato sauce. 4. Top: The use of the word \\"top\\" in this context signifies the layering of ingredients on the pizza, with cheese being the final layer.

Q: The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle. On the pattern of the Byzantine system the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on march or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body. The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles.

Write an article based on this \\"The Conservatives have taken charge at two councils in Suffolk which previously had no overall control.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Conservative Party Claims Victory at Two Councils in Suffolk as Political Power Shifts Introduction: The political landscape of Suffolk has undergone a significant change as the Conservatives have recently gained control of two councils. These local government bodies were previously operating under no overall control, meaning that no single political party had held a majority representation. This accomplishment signifies an important step forward for the Conservative party, as they consolidate their power in the region. In this article, we will examine the factors and strategies that may have contributed to their success and how this political shift may impact the future of local governance in Suffolk. Background on Council Elections and the Prior Situation: Suffolk, a county in the East of England, has traditionally seen a mix of political parties in control at the local level. In recent years, both the Conservative and the Labour party have held power in various councils across the county. However, two councils that remained under no overall control signaled an opportunity for any of the competing political parties to claim a stronger foothold in the region. The Conservative Strategy that Led to Success: The Conservatives were able to claim victory in these two councils by deploying a targeted campaign strategy that resonated with local voters. They focused on key issues such as infrastructure development, improved social services, and economic growth to engender support from the community. Additionally, the Conservative party capitalized on any division or lack of coordination among the opposition parties. By presenting a united front and a clear message, the Conservatives were able to garner the support of undecided voters and those dissatisfied with the performance of the previous administration. The Impact of the Conservative Party Gaining Control of the Two Councils: The Conservative party taking charge in these two councils has several implications for the local political landscape. Firstly, it showcases their ability to mobilize support and secure key victories in councils that were once believed to be out of their reach. This may lead to increased confidence among party supporters and potentially draw more attention and resources to their campaigns in future elections. Secondly, this shift in power may result in new policies and initiatives that align with the Conservatives' views. Suffolk residents can expect to see changes in the way local government operates and delivers services, as the new administration begins to implement its political agenda. It will be crucial for constituents to engage with their local representatives and stay informed about how these changes will impact their lives. Lastly, this success may embolden the Conservatives to push for further political victories in other councils where they currently hold a minority or are in close competition with other parties. This could potentially enhance their influence across Suffolk and strengthen their position in future elections. Conclusion: The recent victories of the Conservative party in two Suffolk councils marks a notable shift in the local political landscape and demonstrates the potential for further changes in the coming years. As the Conservatives settle into their new roles, it remains to be seen how their political agenda will shape the future of governance in Suffolk. Residents and political observers alike will be keeping a close eye on policy changes and the overall impact on regional development and welfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Schwyz is a canton in central Switzerland between the Alps in the south, Lake Lucerne to the west and Lake Zürich in the north, centered on and named after the town of Schwyz. - Stauffacher is a tram junction ( lines 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 14 ) in Aussersihl , Zurich , next to the St. Jakob church , situated along the Badenerstrasse between the Bäcker and the Stauffacher streets . The tram stop was named after the street , which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893 . Stauffacher is officially just the name of the tram stop , not the square , and there was formerly a Stauffacherplatz some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl ( named in 1898 ) . Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate Stauffacherplatz with the tram stop , leading to confusion with the actual Stauffacherplatz , the latter was renamed to Ernst - Nobs - Platz in 2003 . St. Jakob was the site of a sick - house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century . The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221 . It was the site of the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl in 1443 . In 1677 , the sick - house was transformed into a Pfrundhaus ( senior citizens ' residence ) , disestablished in 1842 . The current St. Jakob church building was inaugurated in 1901 . - The Limmat is a river in Switzerland. The river commences at the outfall of Lake Zurich, in the southern part of the city of Zurich. From Zurich it flows in a northwesterly direction, after 35 km reaching the river Aare. The confluence is located north of the small town of Brugg and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The Sihl is a Swiss river that rises near the Druesberg mountain in the canton of Schwyz, and eventually flows into the Limmat in the centre of the city of Zürich.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat The answer to this question is:","completion":"survive The primary goal of a poor person having food is to survive. Every individual requires food to provide energy, essential nutrients, and sustenance for their body to properly function. Food is essential for maintaining good health, staying alive, and in the case of a poor person, this importance is magnified due to limited resources and the potential inability to access adequate nourishment. When a poor person has the opportunity to eat food, it helps them meet their essential nutritional needs and prevents the detrimental consequences of malnutrition. Adequate nourishment can improve overall well-being, physical and mental health, cognitive function, and resistance to various illnesses. Depending on the availability of food, a poor person may have inconsistent meals, making it even more critical for them to focus on food that will allow them to survive and maintain their health as best as possible. While the other options like digesting, being full, will not starve, and getting fat might apply to different contexts, the most suitable and comprehensive answer is 'survive.' The reason is that it broadly covers the foremost priorities and necessities of a poor person when it comes to consuming food. In these circumstances, a poor individual may not prioritize getting full or gaining weight, but rather obtaining the vital sustenance their body requires for survival and functioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write the next sentence in the following story. How to cook white rice without a rice cooker Place the rice in a colander. For the recipe, you'll need 1 cup (225 g) of white rice, though you can adjust the amount based on how many people you're cooking for. In general, you should have ½ cup (112 ½ g) of uncooked rice per person.","completion":"Once the rice has been measured, proceed to thoroughly rinse it under cool running water until the water runs clear, which will help remove any excess starch and prevent the rice from becoming too sticky when cooked. While rinsing, gently rub the rice between your fingers to further remove any debris or impurities that may be present. After the rice is properly rinsed, allow it to drain well in the colander for a few minutes to ensure that no excess water remains. Next, prepare a pot or saucepan with a tight-fitting lid to cook the rice. For each cup of rice, add 1 ¾ cups (414 ml) of water or broth to the pot. If desired, you can also add a pinch of salt or a small splash of oil for added flavor and to prevent any sticking. Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to high. Once the liquid begins to boil, give the rice a quick stir to prevent it from clumping together. As soon as the water is boiling, lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover the pot with the lid and allow the rice to cook undisturbed for approximately 15 to 18 minutes, or until it has absorbed all of the liquid and is tender. Avoid lifting the lid while the rice cooks, as this will release steam and may result in unevenly cooked rice. When the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it stand, still covered, for about 5 minutes. This will allow any remaining steam to be absorbed and will help to further fluff up the rice. After the standing time, gently fluff the rice with a fork, taking care to not compact it or break the grains. Before serving, taste the rice and adjust the seasoning if necessary. For added garnish or flavor, you can mix in chopped herbs like cilantro or parsley, or a small pat of butter or drizzle of sesame oil. Enjoy your perfectly cooked white rice as a versatile and satisfying side dish or as the foundation for countless recipes, from stir-fries and burritos to sushi rolls and rice bowls. By following these simple steps, you'll be able to consistently cook perfect white rice without a rice cooker, and you'll have the confidence to tackle a wide variety of rice-based dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The number of cranes that pepper the skyline is a useful indicator of economic activity.","completion":"Title: The Sky-high Impact of Cranes on Economic Activity: An In-depth Analysis Introduction Cranes, the majestic construction giants, silently dot the skyline of many cities around the world. They've become a visible embodiment of the growth and development taking place within these urban landscapes. As the global economy recovers from the downturn caused by COVID-19, many businesses and governments are eager to kickstart their development. In this context, it is interesting to explore the presence of cranes as an indicator of economic activity around the world. The number of these looming giants can provide insights into the extent of investment in infrastructure and the overall prosperity of a territory. What Do Cranes Signify? Cranes are heavy construction equipment used for lifting and transporting heavy materials during the construction process. Commonly found in the heart of urban territories, cranes are primarily utilized for the vertical transportation of equipment and materials at construction sites, including skyscrapers, roads, bridges, and other major infrastructure projects. The presence of cranes at a construction project indicates that capital investments are being made in the area, often leading to new businesses, homes, and infrastructure. With substantial resources being allocated, cranes signify confidence in the economic growth and an increase in economic activity in and around the region. The Crane Index Some industry analysts have come up with an informal metric they called the \\"Crane Index.\\" This index is a rough indicator of a city's economic health, wherein the more cranes visible, the better the economic condition. In order to determine the Crane Index, researchers compile the number of fixed cranes at active construction sites within a certain region. This index has been particularly useful for urban planners, economists, and real estate professionals seeking insight into construction activity and trends. The Crane Index has been credited for its accurate prediction of economic boom times in regions such as Australia, where the Sydney Crane Index in 2013 presaged economic growth in the construction sector. Similarly, the number of cranes in Dubai acted as a forewarning for the Dubai crisis in 2008. The Benefits of Crane-Driven Growth Cranes' presence can have several positive impacts on the economy of a region, which include: 1. Job Creation: An increased number of cranes in a city corresponds to more construction projects, which in turn generates employment opportunities for architects, engineers, construction workers, and a wide range of suppliers and support services. 2. Urban Revitalization: Construction activity depicted by the number of cranes often leads to better infrastructure, housing, and amenities, attracting more people to live and work in the area. This results in a positive cycle of economic activity as the inflow of people and businesses create demand for goods and services. 3. Increased Property Values: Infrastructure development drives up the value of the surrounding properties, as improved accessibility and better amenities make the area more attractive for investors and residents. This leads to capital appreciation for property owners and generates increased tax revenue for the government. 4. Confidence and Foreign Investments: A skyline peppered with cranes often signals a robust and growing economy, which can lure foreign investors to invest in the country. The increased perception of economic stability attracts additional foreign direct investments, further boosting the business environment and job creation. Conclusion The number of cranes gracing the skyline can provide an insightful glimpse into the immediate economic activity and overall health of a region. Although it may not be a scientific measure, the Crane Index serves as a useful, quick-reference tool for gauging the vitality of urban construction projects. Ultimately, the humble crane plays a vital role in the growth and wellbeing of communities and functions as an indicator of where an economy is headed, reflecting the aspirations of its people towards a prosperous future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Angela scornfully imagines herself Digivolving into Angelamon to defeat Mrs. Brinks and Nannette, removing all obstacles in enjoying her movie. However, everyone in the audience realizes they are in the wrong movie, so they quickly leave to go to the correct theater, leaving Mrs. Brinks and Nannette behind with the latter covered in food.Eight Years Ago[edit]Main article: Digimon AdventureIn Highton View Terrace, before their adventure in the Digital World, siblings Tai and Kari Kamiya witness a Digi-Egg emerging from their computer. The egg soon hatches, revealing a Botamon. The Digimon rapidly digivolves into Koromon and then a very large Agumon, who unintentionally destroys a good part of the neighborhood, Kari states that this isn't the same Agumon they become friends later with. A second Digi-Egg appears in the sky to reveal a Parrotmon. Agumon digivolves to Greymon, but brutally loses the battle. Tai wakes Greymon with Kari's whistle, who defeats Parrotmon and disappears with him.Four Years Later[edit]Main article: Our War GameAbout six months after the DigiDestined departed from the Digital World, Izzy discovers a Digi-Egg on the internet that has been infected by a virus. He rushes over to Tai's apartment to inform him about the newly hatched Digimon, Kuramon. Tai and Izzy monitor it and are astonished as Kuramon consumes large amounts of computer data to rapidly digivolve to Keramon. Gennai appears in a transmission from the Digital World, warning them about the dangers of his growth. He dispatches Agumon and Tentomon to stop the Digimon. Keramon digivolves into Infermon and easily defeats the Champion and Ultimate forms of Tentomon and Agumon. Izzy realizes that Keramon completely skipped over his Champion form and digivolved straight to his Ultimate level. Tai tries to alert the rest of the DigiDestined, but only succeeds in enlisting the help of Matt, T.K., Gabumon and Patamon. Agumon and Gabumon Warp Digivolve to WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, prompting Infermon to Digivolve into Diaboromon. A massive amount of emails are sent to Tai and Izzy from people around the world who are watching the battle from their computers. This causes WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon to slow down and they are severely injured in the fight. Diaboromon begins to duplicate himself at an exponential rate and infects computers at the Pentagon, launching two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles: one headed for Colorado, the other for Tai and Izzy's neighborhood in Odaiba, Tokyo. Refusing to lose hope, Tai and Matt's bond with their Digimon allow them to become digital and enter the internet to comfort WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon. Tai and Matt remind them about all the people around the world watching them and sending emails with encouraging words. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon are revived by the collective power of the millions of children around the world and DNA Digivolve to Omnimon. Omnimon easily defeats all of the Diaboromon copies, leaving only the original. With one minute left until the missile impact, Diaboromon is still too fast for them to hit. With seconds left on the clock, Izzy redirects the incoming emails to Diaboromon to slow him down. Omnimon destroys Diaboromon by stabbing him through the head just in time and the nukes are disabled just before detonation.

However, T.K. and Kari's train becomes derailed by Wendigomon on the way and they are unable to meet with the others. Meanwhile, after taking planes and taxis, Davis, Yolei, and Cody meet Willis in a truck. When Willis tries to get their group transportation to his house for some pizza, the ride leaves without him and Davis; however, Davis devises a plan to get themselves to Colorado faster with the help of Raidramon. At the rendez-vous point, Davis, Yolei, and Cody began to question Willis' knowledge about Wendigomon. Hesitantly, Willis reveals that he, as a child, tried to create a digi-egg after experiencing the joys of having his twin Digimon (Terriermon and Kokomon). However, this only resulted in Diaboromon's creation. Willis assumes full responsibility for the situation. However, Davis and Terriermon convince him to let them help, as they are friends and are on the same team. At Willis's home the next morning, Wendigomon expectedly reappears, but Digivolves to Antylamon and easily defeats the DigiDestined. Once digivolved into Cherubimon, he proceeds to eat their Digimon, but T.K. and Kari arrive at the nick of time to provide back-up with Angemon and Angewomon.

Veemon and Terriermon Golden Armor Digivolve to Magnamon and Rapidmon and allow themselves to be swallowed by Cherubimon. Inside, they see a manifestation of Wendigomon's true self, who begs them to destroy the virus. After doing so, Cherubimon succumbs to his injuries and dies.

To better understand the revision of the Julian calendar and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, let's delve into the calendar's history and the role Pope Gregory XIII played in its creation. The Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE, was widely used across the Roman Empire and in European territories that had contact with the Romans. It was designed as a solar year model, meaning it was intended to accurately depict the time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the Sun. The calendar year lasted 365.25 days, with an additional day added every four years as a leap year. Although the idea behind the Julian calendar was innovative for its time, it had a significant flaw: the actual solar year is about 11 minutes shorter than 365.25 days. This slight miscalculation began to cause a shift in the calendar, leading to the dates of important Christian celebrations like Easter gradually moving away from their originally intended timeframes. This issue concerned religious leaders, including Pope Gregory XIII, who sought to revise the Julian calendar to correct this discrepancy. Pope Gregory XIII, born Ugo Buoncompagni, was elected to the papacy in 1572. His interest in reforming the calendar led him to assemble a team of scholars, mathematicians, and astronomers under the supervision of physician and astronomer Aloysius Lilius. This group proposed a more accurate solar year length of 365.2425 days, which would reduce the miscalculation of the Julian calendar. The new calendar system became known as the Gregorian calendar, named in honor of Pope Gregory XIII. To officially implement this new calendar, Pope Gregory XIII issued the papal bull Inter gravissimas on 24 February 1582. This decree detailed the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, including instructions for adjusting the date. The change included the removal of ten days in October 1582 and a revised leap year system that omitted leap years in years divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. While the Gregorian calendar was initially only adopted within Catholic countries, it progressively gained acceptance across the globe. Today, the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used civil calendar in the world, though its implementation was a collaborative effort involving several individuals and teams. To summarize, the statement that the Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted by Pope Gregory XIII is essentially correct, but it's important to recognize the team of scholars who contributed to the project and the multi-faceted process that led to the calendar's development and widespread adoption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.

Information: - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian. He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for \\"LA Weekly\\" and \\"Rolling Stone Australia\\". - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner. - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Write an article with the title: \\"Angel of the North won't turn green for St Patrick's Day\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Angel of the North Won't Turn Green for St Patrick's Day\\" The iconic, emotionally resonant symbol of the North, lovingly christened the Angel of the North, doesn't intend to turn green in celebration of St Patrick's Day this year. Despite various global landmarks routinely participating in the \\"Global Greening\\" initiative on this festive day, the Giant of Gateshead remains a notable exception. Dressed in its perennial rust-red apparel, the Angel of the North stands as a silent paragon of Britain's industrial heritage. Ever since its inception in 1998, the towering statue by Antony Gormley started diplomatically ignoring St Patrick's Day's color-themed tradition. This decision, while initially prompting some discontent among certain quarters, has gradually gained acceptance and understanding among locals and visitors alike. The trend of transforming world landmarks into lush green on St Patrick's Day, also known as \\"Global Greening,\\" started in 2010 with the initiative of Tourism Ireland. The aim was to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick, and promote Ireland as a tourist destination worldwide. However, the Angel of the North maintains its stance of neutrality. The reasons behind this decision derive from the statue's deep-rooted symbolism. The Angel of the North is more than a statue. It is a testament to the industriousness and resilience of the Northern communities. It is a proud tribute to the coal miners who toiled beneath the statue's site for over two centuries. It is an eternal monument signifying time and change, reflecting the transition from an industrial age to the information age. To paint or light the Angel green for a day would be to overlay another story on top of the one the statue already tells – and has been telling for over two decades. The consensus is that such an act might inadvertently dilute the potency of its original narrative and what it stands for, thereby potentially diverting from the intended focus of this emblem of northern resilience and rebirth. Worthy of mention is the fact that not conforming to this global tradition on St Patrick's Day doesn't mean disrespect or disregard for the celebration itself. Numerous other UK landmarks participate with thorough enthusiasm. London Eye, the Eden Project in Cornwall, Nelson's column, and many more typically deck themselves in green lights, showcasing solidarity with the Irish community and fostering the spirit of inclusiveness that constitutes the bedrock of the United Kingdom's societal fabric. St Patrick's Day celebrations will continue in all their vigor, the world turning a shade greener with collective enthusiasm. Even as the Angel of the North chooses to stand in its rust-red glory, it does so respecting this global gesture, not belittling it. The Angel bears silent testimony to the fact that on St Patrick's Day, everyone can be Irish, each in their own unique way. Wrapping up, the Angel of the North, a titanic sentinel rooted firmly in the soils of northeastern England, will persist in its rusty-red color regardless of the holiday. It's not about rebuffing a tradition, but about holding onto its own, an enduring depiction of resilience and the history of the North. True to its role as a perennial northern icon, the Angel will remain as is, its calm, rust-red exterior narrating the saga of an era bygone, even as the world celebrates St Patrick's Day in varying shades of green.---"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Richard Francis Dennis Barry III (born March 28, 1944) is an American retired professional basketball player who played in both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in history by the NBA in 1996, Barry is the only player to lead the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), ABA and NBA in scoring for an individual season. He was known for his unorthodox but effective underhand free throw shooting technique, and at the time of his retirement in 1980, his .900 free throw percentage ranked first in NBA history. In 1987, Barry was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In Barry's first season in the NBA with the Warriors, the team improved from 17 to 35 victories. In the All-Star Game one season later, Barry erupted for 38 points as the West team stunned the East squad, which featured Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell and head coach Red Auerbach among other all-time greats. Later that season, Barry and company extended the mighty Philadelphia 76ers to six highly competitive games in the NBA Finals, something that Russell and the Boston Celtics could not do in the Eastern Conference playoffs. That 76ers team is considered to be one of the greatest in basketball history. Nicknamed the \\"Miami Greyhound\\" by longtime San Francisco-area broadcaster Bill King because of his slender physical build and remarkable quickness and instincts, the 6'7\\" Barry won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 25.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game in the 1965-66 season. The following year, he won the 1967 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 38-point outburst and led the NBA in scoring with a 35.6 point per game average -- which still ranks as the eighth- highest output in league annals. Teamed with star center Nate Thurmond in San Francisco, Barry helped take the Warriors to the 1967 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in six games. Including a 55-point outburst in Game 3, Barry averaged 40.8 points per game in the series, an NBA Finals record that stood for three decades. Upset that he was not paid incentive monies that he believed due from Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli, Barry jumped to the ABA's Oakland Oaks, who offered him a lucrative contract and the chance to play for Bruce Hale, his then father-in-law. The three-year contract offer from Pat Boone, the singer and team owner, was estimated to be worth 500,000, with Barry saying \\"the offer Oakland made me was one I simply couldn't turn down\\" and that it would make him one of basketball's highest-paid players. The courts ordered Barry to sit out the 1967-68 season before he starred in the ABA, upholding the validity of the reserve clause in his contract. He preceded St. Louis Cardinals' outfielder Curt Flood, whose better-known challenge to the reserve clause went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, by two years as the first American major-league professional athlete to bring a court action against it. The ensuing negative publicity cast Barry in a negative light, portraying him as selfish and money-hungry. However, many NBA players at the time were looking at jumping to the ABA for more lucrative contracts. Barry would star in the ABA, twice averaging more than 30 points per game. did he win any awards?","completion":"Yes, Richard Francis Dennis Barry III, or simply Rick Barry, did win several awards during his basketball career. As a player, Barry was outstanding and was awarded numerous times. In his first year, he was honored as the NBA Rookie of the Year because he was the best new player. That's like being the best new kid in a school full of really good students. Besides that, he also won the NBA All-Star Game MVP award, which is kind of like being named the best player at a special game where all the best players play. His high scoring in a season also led to him being recognized as the scoring champion in the NBA, the ABA, and even in college games. And despite losing in the NBA finals, his super high scoring earned him the record for highest points per game in the NBA Finals for 30 years. Imagine scoring so many points in important games that nobody could beat your record for a long time! Then, after he retired, which means stopped playing professionally, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is a huge honour. It's like your school putting up a picture of you to remember how great you were.

Write some highlights for the following article: A 23-year-old online poker star has beaten the reigning World Series of Poker Player of the Year in a 1million buy-in charity poker tournament. Holden, Massachusetts, resident Daniel Colman won 15.3million on Tuesday in the Big One for One Drop poker event in Las Vegas. It's the second-largest payout in the series' history, behind only the 18million paid out in the inaugural Big One event in 2012. Mr Colman, a professional card player, refused to talk to reporters after winning the tournament, or even smile, according to The Las Vegas Sun. Daniel Colman of Massachusetts outlasted 41 other poker players to win this 15.3million pile of cash at the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas. Eventually he was persuaded to pose with his winnings and special bracelet, but declined every request for an interview to discuss how he outlasted 41 other players during the three-day event. He wouldn't even talk to ESPN, which is planning to air a six-hour documentary later this month chronicling his victory. Instead Mr Colman sped out of the Rio's Amazon Room within five minutes of the high point of his short career, accompanied by Olivier Busquet and Haralados Voulgaris, high-rolling gamblers presumed to have bankrolled part of his buy-in, the paper reported. Mr Colman, or one of his handlers, apparently said as they rushed out the door that he had 'no interest in promoting poker.' Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native who took second place at the tournament, discussed the event afterward. Just two months ago Mr Colman had just 350,000 in live tournament earnings to his name. Now he's earned more than 18million, the fourth-most any American has made playing poker, according to the Hendon Mob poker database. 'Really he’s a class act, a good kid and I really like the way he plays,' said Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native whom Mr Colman bested, according to Card Player. 'He plays a lot different than a lot of the other young kids, because he’s a lot more careful.' Mr Negreanu took home 8million for his second-place finish. In a 2013 interview with HUSNG.com, Mr Colman said he almost gave up poker the year before to pursue his education. 'Summer of 2012, I was making plans to go back to college and give up poker, but I messed up my applications and then ultimately decided to give poker one last go around,' he said. 'It was winter in Montreal and I was playing every single day. After that, I moved to Rio de Janiero where I definitely didn’t play as much, and now I am back in Montreal in the summer when the weather is nice so my grind isn’t ideal here, but it’s still pretty good. I’ve also made a lot of trips to Vegas, New York, and back home in Massachusetts, as well as one trip to Sweden for a week.' The Big One tournament raised 4.6million for the One Drop Foundation, a nonprofit created by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and dedicated to providing clean water to developing countries.

Does the sentence \\"Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state.\\" answer the question \\"What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?\\" However, it does provide some contextual information that can lead to a better understanding of why tornadoes might be less frequent in the western piedmont area. To answer the original question, it is important to consider various factors that may provide some level of protection or contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont. These factors may include: 1. Topography: The western part of the piedmont region typically has a more varied and hilly terrain compared to the flatter areas in the eastern part of the state. This terrain can have a disrupting effect on the formation and path of tornadoes, as the airflow can become disrupted or redirected by hills and valleys. As a result, tornadoes may be less likely to occur in areas with a more complex topography. 2. Climate: The climate in the western piedmont region can also play a role in tornado development, or lack thereof. It may be characterized by weather conditions that are less conducive to the formation of severe thunderstorms, which are necessary for tornadoes to form. Differences in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure between the western piedmont and the eastern part of the state can limit the formation and intensity of thunderstorms. 3. Prevailing wind patterns: Wind patterns can play a significant role in the development of tornadoes. In some regions, the wind patterns may help to steer atmospheric disturbances and thunderstorms to certain areas, while providing protection to other areas. It is possible that the western piedmont may be less prone to tornadoes due to prevailing wind patterns that reduce the likelihood of severe thunderstorms in the region. 4. Proximity to weather systems: The location of the western piedmont in relation to major weather systems, such as frontal boundaries, jet streams, and low-pressure systems, can influence the likelihood of tornadoes. If the western piedmont is less prone to interacting with such weather systems, it may experience fewer tornadoes than other areas. 5. Urban modification: Lastly, though not a natural protection, urban development and land use changes can also impact the likelihood of a tornado forming or tracking across a specific area. The western piedmont may have more forests, parks, or agricultural lands that serve as barriers to tornado development. This added protection could result in a lower tornado risk compared to the eastern part of the state. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not explicitly address the factors protecting the western piedmont from tornadoes, it provides an indirect clue by mentioning a higher risk of tornadoes in the eastern part of the state. To answer the question comprehensively, one must consider topography, climate, prevailing wind patterns, proximity to weather systems, and urban modification that contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

Congo continued preserving their picturesque beaches. Which country caused less turbidity in the coastal water? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Considering the information provided, it is evident that Congo has caused less turbidity in its coastal waters compared to Nigeria. This conclusion is based on the different approaches each country has taken concerning their coastal environments and the consequences of their actions. Nigeria chose to invest in sand mining and began mining its coastal barriers. Sand mining has several negative effects on the coastal environment, including increased erosion and disturbances to local wildlife. As mentioned, sand mining has contributed to the near extinction of gharials in India, as it destroys nesting grounds for various animals that rely on sandy beaches. In addition to the destruction of fauna, sand mining also impacts the turbidity of water in the coastal region. When underwater and coastal sand is disturbed, it causes an increase in the amount of suspended particles in the water, resulting in greater turbidity. This increase in turbidity is harmful to marine organisms that rely on sunlight, such as coral reefs. The diminished water quality can also have a negative effect on the financial stability of local fisheries, as their primary source of income becomes increasingly jeopardized. Furthermore, the removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, can lead to flooding in beachside communities. The damage caused by sand mining extends beyond the environment and into the local economy, as the attractiveness for tourists degrades, resulting in a decrease in tourism-generated income for these areas. On the other hand, Congo has opted for preserving their picturesque beaches, which has an overall positive effect on maintaining the turbidity of their coastal waters. By not engaging in sand mining and preserving the natural environment, Congo is effectively allowing essential ecological processes to remain intact and undisturbed, specifically those crucial to the health of their coastal ecosystems, such as dune systems and the habitats that rely on them. This decision results in lower levels of turbidity in the water, ensuring the well-being of marine organisms that depend on sunlight and clear waters to survive. Moreover, Congo's beautiful beaches can remain attractive tourist destinations contributing positively to the local economy. In conclusion, based on the comparison between Nigeria's sand mining activities and Congo's focus on preserving their beaches, it is clear that Congo has caused less turbidity in their coastal waters. By maintaining their natural ecosystems and avoiding destructive activities such as sand mining, Congo has safeguarded the health of their coastal environment and the organisms that inhabit it, while also allowing for the continued benefit of tourism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to who won the final hoh big brother 20??","completion":"Big Brother 20, the 20th season of the popular reality television series, aired in 2018 on the CBS network in the United States. The show is formatted around a competition where several contestants (\\"houseguests\\") live together in a custom-built house, being constantly recorded by video cameras. Each week, the houseguests vote to evict one of their own until only two remain, and the final winner is decided by a jury of previously evicted houseguests. The show has three parts of the final Head of Household (HOH) competition, which typically determines the two houseguests who make it to the final two. In Big Brother 20, the final HOH competition took place between the last three houseguests – Tyler Crispen, Kaycee Clark, and JC Mounduix. Here's a breakdown of each part of the final HOH competition: 1. Part 1: \\"Jetpack Attack\\" – This competition required the houseguests to hold on to jetpacks while being suspended in the air. They needed to endure elements such as water, wind, and an earthquake simulation. The last houseguest remaining on their jetpack would win this round. Kaycee Clark emerged as the winner of Part 1. 2. Part 2: \\"Mount Evictus\\" - The competition was a combination of mental and physical tasks. It required the houseguests to climb a rock wall and complete a puzzle by placing the faces of their fellow houseguests in the correct order according to eviction weeks. Tyler Crispen and JC Mounduix faced off in this part, with Tyler emerging as the winner. 3. Part 3: \\"Jury Oddcasts\\" – This final competition took place live during the season finale. It involved the two winners of the previous parts (Kaycee and Tyler). Both contestants had to predict how the jurors completed statements about their time in the Big Brother house. The houseguest with the most correct answers would become the final HOH. In this case, Kaycee emerged victorious with five correct answers compared to Tyler's four. As the final HOH, Kaycee Clark had the power to choose who she would take with her to the final two. She chose Tyler Crispen, resulting in the eviction of JC Mounduix. In the end, Kaycee was crowned the winner of Big Brother 20 by a jury vote of 5 to 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

The answer to the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words is called \\"Má vlast.\\" It represents a significant development in Smetana's compositional style, marking his growth as a modern neo-Romantic composer able to handle large-scale forces and utilize advanced musical concepts. \\"Má vlast\\" embodies the essence of national struggle and is considered an iconic piece in the realm of Czech music.

America’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond. In many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system – years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle – cannot come soon enough for them. But for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US’s commitment to return to expensive manned missions. “For a while I thought president Obama was going to see sense and would wean America off its fascination with putting men and women into space by scrapping manned missions,” the Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg told the Observer. “Unfortunately, with the flight of Orion, that hope has now been dashed.” Scientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe’s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system’s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future. The existence of these two camps – manned versus unmanned – reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration. “We learned a great deal from the Apollo missions, but their landings were all confined to sites near the lunar equator on one side of the Moon,” he said. “The samples they returned to Earth were made up of rocks found lying around the surface. But on the far side of the Moon, there is a region where meteorite impacts have excavated material from deep below the lunar surface. If we could explore these regions and bring samples back to Earth, we will transform our understanding of how the Earth and its satellite, the Moon, formed in the distant past.” Crawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples. “These missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,” he said. “Humans and robots would work together.” And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added. This vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. “If you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system’s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,” he said. Rees stresses that human spaceflight could still be pursued, without damage to science, if it was left to entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, whose SpaceX rockets are now used to carry cargo to the space station: “However, I think the future of planetary exploration will continue to be dominated by robot probes which will be spread throughout the solar system. You can imagine robot fabricators mining the asteroids and building large structures in space or on the Moon.” From this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station – claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory – as “an orbital turkey”. No important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value. Manned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in which the agency would return to the Moon then head on to Mars. A few days later, Nasa revealed it was making major cutbacks in its programmes of unmanned research in astronomy because they “do not clearly support the goals of the president’s vision for space exploration”. In other words, to support manned missions science projects were cut back. Even worse, says Weinberg, was the example of the US Superconducting Super-Collider, which was designed to study the structure of matter by crashing sub-atomic particles into each other at colossal energies. Its 12bn construction, in Texas, was cancelled in 1993 because Congress decided the US could not build the SSC and the International Space Station, of which the US was the main supporter of funds, at the same time. So it chose to build the space station, mainly for political reasons. This left Europe free to build its own Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, Geneva, a decade later, where scientists discovered the Higgs Boson in 2013 and are set to begin the search for dark matter and other exotic particles when the LHC reopens next year after a refit. By contrast, the US ended up with that “orbital turkey”, a decision described by Weinberg as a tragic mistake. “The only real technology that the space station has produced concerns the technology of keeping humans alive in space – which is a senseless and circular process if you realise there is no point in having humans in space,” he said. So are science and manned spaceflight virtually incompatible? No, says Crawford. For a start, the idea of robot efficiency is a myth, he says, as there is no substitute for putting a person into space to get things done. “Just consider Philae,” he said. “It did bounce when it landed on comet 67P and in the end only carried out a couple of days’ work – albeit very, very important work – before it stopped working. By contrast, if we had had a bigger mission, with humans on board, the pilot would have been able to land it expertly on that tricky terrain. “There would have been no bouncing. Instrument packages would then have been left on the surface while samples of rock, soil and ice from the comet would have been brought back to Earth so they could be studied in detail and at leisure in laboratories. That’s what you get with a manned mission.” The difference in scientific return rates from manned and unmanned missions is vividly illustrated by the Apollo 17 mission, flown by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972, and the robot rover Opportunity which, in 2004, was dropped on to the surface of Mars and has been exploring ever since, said Crawford. “Apollo 17 spent three days on the Moon while its astronauts made journeys across the lunar surface that totalled 31 kilometres,” he said. “They also drilled a three-metre hole into the surface, the deepest made in an object outside Earth, left a range of instrument packages behind them, and then brought back a 76kg of rock back to Earth. “Opportunity took 10 years before it managed to run up a travel total of 31km. More to the point, it returned no samples of any kind, did no drilling and returned only limited data.” The contrast between the scientific returns of the two approaches is revealed by examining the number of scientific papers based on the Apollo missions, says Crawford. These vastly outnumber the papers produced from all the robot missions that have been carried out on the Moon and Mars. And the number of publications based on Apollo sample is still rising. “Its scientific legacy has been far greater than any other mission we have made to another world,” said Crawford. It was a legacy that was bought at a considerable price, however. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s cost 25bn –more than 100bn today. From this perspective, manned missions are more than 100 times more expensive than robot missions, it is calculated. In the early days of spaceflight, there was little alternative to putting humans in spacecraft. But now robotics has achieved an advanced status and is constantly becoming more sophisticated. Martian rovers can navigate rocky terrains, drill holes and analyse soil samples – using 20th-century technology. “Just consider the Rosetta mission,” argues Rees. “It was designed using 1990s technology – when mobile phones were the size of bricks. Now they are compact and contain a wide array of different functions. Imagine what Rosetta would have been able to do if it had been built from that technology. Imagine what future robot spacecraft will be able to do.” Supporters of manned spaceflight, such as Professor Martin Barstow, of Leicester University, accept human flights are much more expensive but say they are justifiable because they are much, much more effective than robot missions: “Consider Mars. You could get robots to scrape its surface and send back material to Earth, but if you want to hunt down the few places that might still support primitive life you will need to send humans. Only they possess the necessary intuition for that kind of task.” Others point to the inspirational effects of putting men in space. In the 1960s astronauts such as Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong stimulated youngsters into careers in science because manned flights create heroes who spark an interest in technology. But again this claim is disputed. If a classroom today displays space photographs, these are more likely to be glorious images of stars and galaxies taken by the Hubble space telescope than pictures of astronauts. “It’s the robot probe that captures interest today,” said Rees. “The only time an astronaut makes news is when a space station toilet gets blocked.” In short, the jury is still out over the future of humans in space. However, one thing is clear: we may one day return to other worlds, like the Moon and maybe Mars, but current global economic problems suggest these trips will happen later rather than sooner. Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly in space when he orbited the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft on 12 April 1961. His mission was followed by a series of flights - by the US and the Soviet Union - of larger and larger capsules. These culminated in the lunar landings of the US Apollo programme in the late 60s and early 70s. The 12 men who landed on the Moon on Apollo spacecraft are the only humans to have walked on another world. After the Apollo programme was brought to a premature close, largely due to lack of public interest in the US, America concentrated its efforts on constructing a fleet of reusable space shuttles. These were intended to become the nation’s primary means of launching payloads into orbit and were to be launched once a week when fully operational according to Nasa’s ambitious timetable. The first shuttle, Columbia, was launched on 12 April 1981. Thirty years later the fleet was retired after a total of only 135 flights - including two catastrophic accidents which destroyed the shuttles Challenger and Columbia and killed each of their seven-person crews. Since then, the only craft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station has been Russia’s Soyuz space capsule. At the same time the Chinese have pursued their own manned spaceflight programme, which began in 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space programme after orbiting the Earth 14 times in his Shenzhou 5 capsule, making China the third country to independently send humans into space. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about the debate between sending humans or robots into space for exploration. Some people believe that humans can accomplish more in space because they can make decisions and do things more quickly than robots. Others think that robots are better because they are less expensive and can still gather important information for scientists. The article discusses some of the recent missions, like the Orion spacecraft and the Rosetta mission with Philae, and what different scientists think about them. The article also mentions the history of human spaceflight, like Yuri Gagarin being the first human in space, and the Apollo missions where astronauts first landed on the Moon."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Information: - A symptom (from Greek , \\"accident, misfortune, that which befalls\\", from , \\"I befall\\", from - \\"together, with\\" and , \\"I fall\\") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. - Primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia is a special form of polydipsia . It is usually associated with a patient 's increasing fluid intake due to the sensation of having a dry mouth . When the term \`\` psychogenic polydipsia '' is used , it implies that the condition is caused by mental disorders . However , the dry mouth is often due to phenothiazine medications used in some mental disorders , rather than the underlying condition . Some forms of primary polydipsia are explicitly characterized as nonpsychogenic . - Thirst is the craving for fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink. It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance. It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as salt. If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, the brain signals thirst. - Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek \\"very thirsty\\", which is derived from (\\"much, many\\") + (\\"thirst\\"). Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds. What is the relationship between 'primary polydipsia' and 'disease'? The answer is:","completion":"Primary polydipsia is a specific form of polydipsia characterized by excessive thirst and increased fluid intake, often driven by the sensation of having a dry mouth.

Fangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe managed to buy his own farm near Balcarce within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. His father, Loreto, emigrated to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia Deramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers. Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards. The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact?, what is it ?

Article: -For five days, Edmonton's Downtown Park is transformed into one huge stage where artists are able to share their talents, and where people are able to celebrate and enjoy themselves. Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \\"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,\\" Riedel said. \\"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a 2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close.

Write highlights for this article: For an hour or so, Diego Costa had the look of a striker who might have been nursing a hamstring problem; one which was preying on his mind, eating away at confidence and preventing him from turning his dial to full power. Then he crashed a header past Villa keeper Brad Guzan to score Chelsea’s second goal — his eighth in seven games this season — created the third for Willian and, with Chelsea’s opponents beaten, left the field to another standing ovation. Jose Mourinho’s team continue to forge ahead at the top of the Premier League. They have won from the front before and are shaping up as if in the mood to do it again. Yet the lingering concerns over Costa’s fitness will stop anyone getting carried away in west London. Chelsea striker burst into life with a crashing header on the hour and was the catalyst for another in his side's comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge. CHELSEA 4-2-3-1: Courtois 6.5; Ivanovic 7, Cahill 5.5, Terry 6, Azpilicueta 6; Fabregas 7, Matic 7; Willian 7.5, Oscar 7 (Mikel 77), Hazard 6 (Schurrle 68, 6); Costa 7 (Remy 81).

Subs not used: Given, Clark, Bacuna, Sanchez, Grealish. Bookings: Cleverley, Senderos. Manager: Paul Lambert 6. Without him, they lose their cold spearhead. While he is fit and tormenting centre-halves they seem well-armed to charge clear. Loic Remy replaced Costa for the last 10 minutes, as Mourinho turned his thoughts to Tuesday’s game against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League and wondered whether he can risk him from the start in Portugal. Mourinho’s team remain unbeaten this season. They have dropped only two points from six games. After Sporting, they play Arsenal at home and Mourinho knows his striker must be handled with extreme care. ‘He is doing almost nothing [between games],’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning. ‘He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence.’ ‘If he doesn’t go to the national team, and stays here for 15 days of treatment, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and top for national team. We can’t do anything. I can’t speak to the Spain manager.’ If there was any cause for complaint yesterday, it might have been that the manager would have liked the points to be secure sooner, especially as it had started so well, when Oscar fired in a seventh-minute opener, a goal owing everything to the persistence of Willian. Branislav Ivanovic slid a pass to the latter, who forced Guzan into a save but the rebound spilled kindly to Willian, who spotted Oscar unmarked. From seven yards, Oscar swept in his first Premier League goal of the season. Willian went close soon after but the visitors responded.

Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor shoots to no avail against Chelsea. Aly Cissokho almost turned a shot on target when Chelsea failed to clear a corner and Gary Cahill was booked for tripping Gabriel Agbonlahor after being turned and left on the turf by the Villa striker. It was the home team, however, who dominated both in terms of possession and unconverted chances, defied as they were by wasteful finishing, solid defending and good goalkeeping. For almost an hour Costa had lacked some of his usual menace. Twice, either side of half time, he was found in front of goal and twice Guzan saved without fuss. The sequence ended in the 59th minute. Cesar Azpilicueta delivered the cross from the left, clipped towards the near post for Costa, who climbed above Nathan Baker and this time beat Guzan for power. This was the goal to sink Villa. They had set up to play on the counter-attack and there was plenty to admire about their spirit and energy. Fabian Delph impressed in an English midfield trio with Ashley Westwood and Tom Cleverley and almost equalised in the second half with a shot from distance. ‘If you told me we would take three points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, I would probably have taken it,’ said Villa manager Paul Lambert. ‘It’s tough and we’re up against Manchester City next. ’ Despite the quality of the opposition, it is back-to-back 3-0 defeats for Villa and their 1-0 win at Anfield on September 13 loses its gloss with each subsequent game Liverpool fail to win. Villa are still without captain Ron Vlaar and striker Christian Benteke and a positive start to the campaign has taken a turn for the worse since the club was struck by a virus last week. And yesterday Lambert was left to reflect on chances not taken when they trailed 1-0; Baker headed a good one over from a free-kick and Lambert said: ‘When you get a chance you have to score. It’s hard to come here at the best of times. Chelsea will be close to winning the title and the Champions League.’ By the end, however, Villa had managed only one shot on target and Thibaut Courtois celebrated his second clean sheet of the season. Chelsea pressed on after the second goal. Cissokho recovered well to clear off his own line from Oscar but Willian then grabbed the goal his performance deserved by scoring from Costa’s rebound. This was enough for Mourinho. With a three-goal lead, off came Costa to be wrapped in cotton wool. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.

One such entrepreneur is Kathy Ku, a 24-year-old woman who has been making waves, and quite literally, as the founder of Spouts of Water - an organization that provides affordable, efficient, and sustainable ceramic water filters to communities in Uganda. From her dorm room beginnings to her team's current work in clean water access, let's take a closer look at Kathy's journey and how she is changing lives in Uganda. Kathy Ku's Story Born and raised in the United States, Kathy Ku took a deep dive into the world of clean water access in 2010 when she first visited Uganda during her senior year in high school. Exposed to the crippling effects of the lack of access to clean water in rural Ugandan communities, a seed was planted in her heart. As she pursued her undergraduate degree in Physics and Environmental Science at Harvard University, the idea to provide a sustainable solution to the crisis only blossomed further. The Birth of Spouts of Water With the development of her senior thesis on affordable ceramic water filters as the starting point, in 2013, Kathy, alongside two close friends, embarked on a journey to make a significant difference in Uganda's water crisis. Together, they founded Spouts of Water - a social enterprise that designs, manufactures, and distributes high-quality, locally-produced ceramic water filters. The ceramic filters require no electricity to run, making them suitable for rural households that often lack access to electricity. Impact on Ugandan Communities Spouts of Water’s primary objective is to provide clean, safe, and accessible drinking water to Ugandan households. These ceramic water filters have been proven to effectively remove 99.9% of bacteria from contaminated water sources. By directly addressing the root cause of waterborne diseases and illness, Spouts of Water has had a remarkable impact in the lives of Ugandan communities. Apart from ensuring access to clean water, the organization has created an employment ecosystem within Uganda. As they source raw materials and labor from local communities, this young enterprise has become instrumental in supporting families with steady income and, in turn, creating a sustainable economy. The team at Spouts of Water is committed not only to providing clean water, but also to empowering the people of Uganda. An Inspiring and Sustainable Leadership Model At the helm of Spouts of Water, Kathy Ku's inspiring and sustainable leadership playbook has become a beacon of hope for countless young entrepreneurs. By focusing on creating a local and sustainable solution, Kathy shows how a small team can efficiently address a significant issue such as water scarcity in a developing country. Kathy has been instrumental in raising over 300,000 in seed capital, which has spurred Spouts of Water to distribute filters to more than 140,000 people across Uganda till now. Spouts also collaborates with various NGOs and government initiatives for further enhancement of the outreach of clean water. Future Prospects Kathy Ku's aspirations do not stop at Uganda. As the team at Spouts of Water works relentlessly to widen their impact, they envision catering to other developing countries in need of a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective solution to the challenges of water contamination. Conclusion Successfully carving a niche in the area of social entrepreneurship, Kathy Ku is a shining example of how young innovators can and are making a difference. With passion, determination, and ingenuity, the Dorm Room CEO has transformed her college room dreams into a sustainable reality that is positively impacting the lives of tens of thousands of people in Uganda and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident occurred after a heated argument between Minaj and a man with whom she was sharing the room. The police reports detail that the escalating argument eventually led to the man forcefully shoving a suitcase across Minaj's chin. This resulted in a noticeable cut to the rapper's lower lip. It is unclear from the reports the nature of the disagreement or what prompted the physical altercation in the otherwise serene Dallas hotel. Authorities were alerted, and police promptly arrived at the scene. They noted Minaj's visible injury and initiated the necessary procedures to address the situation. Their primary concern was the immediate safety and well-being of the individuals involved, as well as gathering information that could potentially aid an ongoing investigation regarding the event. Despite the unfortunate incident, Minaj decided not to file a complaint against the man at the center of the controversy. Her decision not to turn her situation into a legal matter is somewhat reflective of her preference for privacy and keeping her personal affairs out of the public view as much as possible. Minaj, while speaking to the police, emphasized that her relationship with the man in question was purely platitudinal. She clarified that they were \\"only friends\\", and not involved romantically. This statement seems to be a clear attempt by the artist to downplay speculation and potential gossip surrounding the incident. Incidents like these shed a light on the harsh reality of interpersonal conflicts, and the potential for violence, even among individuals in high-profile positions. It also re-iterates the importance of conflict resolution techniques and maintaining a healthy understanding amongst friends. Although Minaj opted to handle the issue privately rather than taking legal action, it doesn't diminish the seriousness of the occurrence. Such incidents can cause not only physical harm but can also have mental health implications. It is important to highlight that no individual, celebrity or not, should have to tolerate any form of violence. Nicki Minaj is one of the most recognized names in the global hip-hop scene, known for her riveting lyrics and vibrant personality. These recent events have undoubtedly shaken her fans worldwide, but they also respect her wish for privacy. As for the artist herself, it is hoped that she is able to recover quickly from this unfortunate incident and continue to make strides in her music career. Minaj’s decision to remain silent legally is being respected, but the incident underscores the unfortunate reality that nobody is exempt from potentially violent situations, regardless of their fame or status. While the events pertaining to the dispute in the Dallas hotel room unfold, listeners worldwide await the renowned artist's return to the microphone, ready to embrace her unapologetic and fierce artistry once more."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence that is either in the Yoruba language or the English language.

In recognition of its history , its economic importance and its administrative success , Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951 . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement or rewording of a paragraph or text in order to articulate its meaning in different words or in a more clear and understandable manner. In the context of the two provided sentences, the same information is being expressed, but with varying word placement. To break it down: The first sentence, \\"Cambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition of its history, economic importance, and administrative success\\", is saying that 1951 was the year in which Cambridge became officially recognized as a city due to its historical significance, economic impact, and effective administration. The second sentence, \\"In recognition of its history, its economic importance and its administrative success, Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951\\", is stating the same context. The difference is the order in which it's presented: it starts with the reasons (its history, economic importance, and administrative success), and then mentions what resulted from those qualities (Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951). Because both sentences are structured differently but communicate the same meaning, one can say they are paraphrases of each other. The intent or meaning isn't changed, only the method of delivering the same information, which is the essence of a paraphrase. It's important to note that \\"city charter\\" and \\"city rights\\" may not be exactly synonymous depending on specific legal contexts, but generally, in this case, they are used to indicate the status of being officially recognized as a city."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Drinking a lot of water does not do any good to the body, according to two experts in the United States. In fact, they warn, drinking too much water could be, in certain cases, harmful. In a study, Dr Stanly Goldfarb and Dr Dan Negoianu, both of the Renal, Electrolyte and Hypertension Division at the University of Pensylvania, the United States, have denied the popular belief that drinking a lot of water clears body toxins better, improves skin, and helps reduce weight. Dr Goldfarb and Dr Negoianu say that they found little proof to back the public opinion that drinking 8 glasses of water every day benefits health. At the same time, they fond little proof of harm in drinking 8 glasses of water every day. It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports. The study at the University of Pennsylvania also examined reports that some people experienced increased headaches when their consumption of water was low. In one small study, which the doctors reviewed, the group drinking the most water reported fewer headaches than the control group, \\"but the difference in the number of headaches was o small between the two groups as to be considered unimportant.\\" The researchers concluded that there is no scientific proof to support that average, healthy people need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each each day. The website medheadines.com says that, according to an Indian doctor, drinking too much water is harmful. If water enters the body more quickly than it can be removed, problems can occur.

Officers found the teen sleeping in a tent over the weekend outside a local college. Instead of giving him a ticket for trespassing, the officers listened to his story – and that’s where this amazing story begins. © 2018 Cox Media Group. Barley, a homeless college student, told the officers he had ridden his little brother’s bike six hours from Conyers to Barnesville to register for classes for his second semester of college. He had two duffel bags carrying all he owned and 2 gallons of water as he rode through the heat of a Georgia summer. Problem is, the Gordon State College campus dorms don’t open until August, so Barley pitched a tent in some bushes on campus and prepared to spend the next few weeks there, with nothing more than a box of cereal to eat. [READ: Teen who biked six hours to college: ‘I thank God every day'] Barley spent the day job-searching and had just returned to his tent Saturday night when officers responded to a report of someone sleeping in a tent on campus. They told Barley to come out with his hands up, but the officers quickly realized that something wasn’t right. They sat down with Barley, who told them his story. The biology major, who dreams of going to medical school one day, told the officers he thought the bushes on campus would be a much safer place for him to sleep than staying in his tent in Conyers. \\"We can’t allow you to stay here, but I have somewhere you can stay.” “He was so understanding and he said, ‘I definitely I applaud you for doing this. We can’t allow you to stay here, but I have somewhere you can stay,’” Barley told Channel 2 Action News. TRENDING STORIES: Without a second thought, the officers took him to a local motel and paid for his next two nights. “The stuff that’s happening with police officers, I am black and he didn’t care what color I was. He just helped me, and that meant a lot,” Barley said. That could be the end of this story, but it was only just the beginning. The officer's wife posted the story on a Barnesville community Facebook page and hundreds of people -- including Casey Blaney -- stepped up to help. “I was shocked by how much support people will give from Lamar County and counties all over and even people from across the country that I’ve never met just wanted to help so much in my life. I was just so shocked and grateful,” Barley said. \\"People from across the country that I’ve never met just wanted to help so much in my life. I was just so shocked and grateful.” Blaney and the motel owner paid for him to stay in his room until he can get into the dorms, which are allowing him to move in early -- on Monday. A local pizzeria, DB's Pizzeria, hired him on as a dishwasher. Owner Debbie Adamson said she saw his story on Facebook and knew immediately that she wanted to help. © 2018 Cox Media Group. “I created a position for him before he walked in my door. I didn’t know his name. I didn’t know the color of his skin. I didn’t care. I’ve been there so I guess I had a soft spot for anyone who is that determined to succeed in life,” she said. Adamson, who’s been through several struggles in her life as well, says they plan to keep him employed and eventually teach him to cook the pizza, while working around his school schedule. “The most shocking part is so many people coming to help a stranger, because honestly in today’s society this sounds like a scam,” Barley said about his story. Casey Blaney posted this photo of Fred on Facebook with a new bike and new shoes. © 2018 Cox Media Group. People have donated clothes, school supplies, shoes, a new bike and they are working to get him a car. People have also stepped up to take care of his dental and medical needs. Blaney created a Facebook page called Success For Fred and also started a GoFundMe page that’s raised nearly 9,000 in two days. But Barley says despite all of that, for which he is extremely grateful, it’s the people that mean the most. “Some of the gifts aren’t as important as the friends I’ve made. More important than everything -- the clothes, the shoes -- the relationships mean so much more to me,” he said. “Some of the gifts aren’t as important as the friends I’ve made.\\" One of those connections is Amber Shoemake, who lost her son Leland to a rare brain infection last year. She says she felt an instant need to help Fred. \\"God bless this sweet guy. Proud to call him a friend,\\" Amber Shoemake wrote about Fred Barley. © 2018 Cox Media Group. “It’s sad because we would do anything to have our child with us, and for him to just be out there with no family, it completely broke my heart,” she said. Barley plans to attend church with Shoemake and her family on Sunday. He says God has been the driving force that keeps him going. TRENDING STORIES: “The Bible says, ‘You can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,’ so I know I can,” he said. “My legs are working. Millions of people walk and bike to work every day. I definitely think I can bike a couple hours to get to my future.” Thursday, Barley recorded a video message to thank everyone who's helped him. © 2018 Cox Media Group. ||||| Notice You must log in to continue. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A 19-year-old homeless college student in Georgia, Fred Barley, biked for six hours to reach his college and slept in a tent until dorms opened for the semester.

Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection. Besides music, Patti Page did a bit of acting. She co-starred with the Oscar-winning Burt Lancaster in \\"Elmer Gantry\\", and also starred on stage in the musical play \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". Question: According to the passage, which one of her following recorded songs was criticized ?

That's a rise of over 46,000 students from last year. Faced with these figures, some British students might be thinking of an interesting alternative: studying abroad. The University of Nottingham, for example,is offering places at its campuses in Ningbo, near Shanghai, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Students here can gain University of Nottingham degrees in business, accounting, engineering and English. Similarly, the University of Bolton says it has 'unlimited' places at its campus in the United Arab Emirates.

There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”.

His latest creations range from virtual shopping malls and electronic ticketing to digital insurance and security. Read also: Tech whiz brings gift of computers to","completion":"African schools Chinery-Hesse's ambitious goal is to create an interconnected Africa through technology, increasing access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for everyone. His projects have been gaining recognition worldwide, resulting in both financial support and collaboration from global tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM. One of his recent ventures is the launch of an e-commerce platform called ShopAfrica53. This initiative aims to provide a marketplace for local African entrepreneurs to showcase their products and services to a global audience, thereby driving economic growth and development across the continent. ShopAfrica53 offers a user-friendly interface for sellers to manage their merchandise, simplify payments, and automate shipping logistics, all essential components to creating thriving online enterprises. Beyond the realm of e-commerce, Chinery-Hesse is determined to bridge the digital divide that many African countries are facing. Through partnerships with international organizations and leading tech companies, he has introduced several tech-focused educational programs. These initiatives aim to provide African school children and college students with access to state-of-the-art computer labs, training, and mentorship, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to the digital economy. Furthermore, Chinery-Hesse has been instrumental in creating employment opportunities in the technology sector for African youth. He argues that, despite the continent's rapid population growth, it can harness this as an advantage rather than a hindrance. A skilled, youthful workforce would lead to increased productivity and innovation, driving economic progress and uplifting entire communities out of poverty. One of the ways Chinery-Hesse has been able to create these employment opportunities is through collaborations with major international tech firms that outsource IT services, software development, and data processing to local African companies. This, in turn, has led to more investment in the local tech industry, empowering African entrepreneurs and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration.

Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is the second installment of the \\"Star Wars\\" prequel trilogy, and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz. Can we draw the following conclusion? George Lucas had more influence on the writing of this film than Jonathan Hales.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that George Lucas likely had more influence on the writing of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones than Jonathan Hales. While we cannot definitively confirm this without further evidence, several factors can be considered to make this conclusion. 1. Direction and Creatorship: George Lucas is not only the director of the film but also the creator of the Star Wars franchise. As the original mind behind the Star Wars universe, Lucas was responsible for crafting its core elements, themes, and characters. This foundational knowledge and insight could have allowed him to have a greater influence on the script, even though he shared writing credits with Jonathan Hales. 2. Final Creative Authority: As the director, Lucas was responsible for the creative vision of the film. Directors are often highly involved in the development of a film's story, and as the writer and director, Lucas would likely hold the final say on creative matters. This authority could have provided him with the opportunity to make decisions regarding the script that were ultimately more impactful than Hales' contributions. 3. Prior Experience as Screenwriter: George Lucas has typically played a significant role in the screenwriting process in the Star Wars series. With his experience in writing the original trilogy and Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it is reasonable to assume that Lucas would have been a major creative force in the writing of Attack of the Clones. 4. Jonathan Hales' Collaborative Relationship with George Lucas: Although Jonathan Hales was credited as a co-writer for the film, it is unclear how much influence he had on the final script. It is possible that Hales' contributions were more in the realm of assisting Lucas with refining ideas and polishing the screenplay, rather than bringing entirely new concepts to the table. In this case, Lucas would still be the primary creative force behind the story and the finished product. With these factors in mind, it seems plausible to conclude that George Lucas had more influence on the writing of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones than Jonathan Hales. However, this conclusion is drawn from the limited information provided and may not be an absolute fact without more detailed analysis of their collaboration and the specific contributions each made to the final script."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Review: Channing Tatum is trying his hardest to prove he can carry a movie, pretty sure he can stop trying - the only reason this movie works is because of him. Lots of hot looking men can only take it so far, but Tatum's charisma and over all likeability saves the show. I read a lot of advanced press about this movie and was excited to see Riley Keough, as well as Alex Pettyfer... kinda underwhelmed by both of them. Keough was in the movie for a total of five minutes (seems like some of that part may have ended up on the cutting room floor) and Pettyfer is way more stiff than in his other efforts.The worst part? I wanted to knock this down a star just for the terrible acting by Cody Horn. This girl has less expression than Kristen Stewart on a good day! I get that the awkward, hard, girl next door thing is popular among directors these days... but come on, she was terrible and had zero chemistry with Tatum.It's a good movie, just not great.

(CNN) Italian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of death of 26 teenage girls whose bodies were recovered in the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday. The girls, aged 14-18, are believed to have been migrants from Niger and Nigeria who had embarked on the treacherous route to Europe from Libya over the weekend. Lorena Ciccotti, Salerno's head of police, told CNN that autopsies would be carried out on Tuesday and that coroners would be investigating whether the girls had been tortured or sexually abused. Migrants disembark in the harbor of Salerno, Italy on Sunday. Their bodies were found close to a flimsy rubber dinghy that had all but sunk when rescuers arrived, Ciccotti said. Aid workers had described a grim scene: survivors hanging onto the remains of the vessel as the girls' bodies floated nearby. Their rescue was one of four separate rescue operations carried out in the Mediterranean over the weekend. In total, 400 people were brought aboard the Spanish vessel Cantabria before disembarking at the Italian port town of Salerno. Read More ||||| Image copyright EPA Image caption Italy wants to determine how the 26 young Nigerian women died Italian prosecutors are investigating the deaths of 26 Nigerian women - most of them teenagers - whose bodies were recovered at sea. There are suspicions that they may have been sexually abused and murdered as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean. Five migrants are being questioned in the southern port of Salerno. A Spanish warship, Cantabria, docked there carrying 375 migrants and the dead women, following several rescues. Twenty-three of the dead women had been on a rubber boat with 64 other people. Italian media report that the women's bodies are being kept in a refrigerated section of the warship. Most of them were aged 14-18. Most of the 375 survivors brought to Salerno were sub-Saharan Africans, from Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, The Gambia and Sudan, the daily La Repubblica reports. Among them were 90 women - eight of them pregnant - and 52 children. There were also some Libyan men and women on board. People-smuggling gangs charge each migrant about 6,000 (£4,578) to get to Italy, 4,000 of which is for the trans-Saharan journey to Libya, according to the Italian aid group L'Abbraccio. Many migrants have reported violence, including torture and sexual abuse, by the gangs. Read more on migrant crisis: In the year to 1 November, 150,982 migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat from North Africa, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports. Of them, 111,552 (nearly 75%) came via the Central Mediterranean route to Italy. The number who died on that route was 2,639, the IOM says. The others arrived in Greece, Cyprus or Spain. The total is less than half the 335,158 who arrived in the same period of 2016. Last year the total for Greece was higher than that for Italy. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants. ||||| Italy Probes Deaths Of 26 Nigerian Women And Girls At Sea Enlarge this image toggle caption Paolo Manzo/NurPhoto/Getty Images Paolo Manzo/NurPhoto/Getty Images Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET Tuesday The bodies of 26 Nigerian girls and women were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea, and Italian prosecutors are probing whether their deaths are linked to sex trafficking. \\"Salvatore Malfi, the police prefect of the southern town of Salerno, said the 26 [victims] may have been thrown off their rubber dinghy into the waters of the Mediterranean,\\" NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome. \\"The cause of death appears to be by drowning.\\" Cantabria, a Spanish warship, brought their bodies to Salerno, Sylvia adds. That ship had carried out other Mediterranean rescues and had 374 rescued migrants on board. According to the BBC, Italian authorities are questioning five migrants. The broadcaster adds that \\"twenty-three of the dead women had been on a rubber boat with 64 other people.\\" Agence France Press reports that a spokesman for the EU anti-trafficking force Sofia said \\"another three bodies had been discovered during other life-saving operations in the Mediterranean this week.\\" Italian media outlets are reporting that the deceased females were mostly between 14 and 18, Sylvia adds. \\"Police Prefect Malfi called this a human tragedy and said his office has appealed to neighboring towns to provide dignified burial for the Nigerian women.\\" The bodies were lowered in black bags from the ship and placed into coffins, the AFP reports. It wasn't immediately clear why all the victims are women. The AFP quotes Malfi as saying that sex traffickers typically use different routes. \\"Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' — as they describe them — in one fell swoop,\\" he said, the news agency reported. Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera recently reported on an uptick in young Nigerian women and girls trafficked into Italy and forced into prostitution. From January to November of this year, some 111,552 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea, according to the International Organization for Migration, and 2,639 migrants have died along that route. That's a smaller number than the same area saw in the same period last year, where 159,467 migrants arrived in Italy and 3,615 people died on the route, according to the IOM. A total number of 2,839 have died so far this year along all primary Mediterranean routes. The Italian aid group L'Abbraccio says that \\"people-smuggling gangs charge each migrant about 6,000 ... to get to Italy, 4,000 of which is for the trans-Saharan journey to Libya,\\" according to the BBC. ||||| The central Mediterranean route from the coast of Libya to Italy is currently the favoured route of undocumented migrants, most of whom are Nigerian (AFP Photo/STRINGER) Rome (AFP) - The bodies of 26 women who drowned attempting the perilous crossing from Libya to Europe were brought to Italy on Sunday, where investigators launched a murder inquiry. A seemingly endless line of black plastic body bags were lowered by crane from a Spanish ship onto the portside in Salerno, southern Italy, where they were placed in coffins and loaded onto waiting hearses. Twenty-three of the women died on Friday after the inflatable dinghy they were travelling on sank, and their bodies were recovered by the Spanish ship Cantabria, which was operating as part of the EU anti-trafficking force Sophia. A Sophia spokesman told AFP another three bodies had been discovered during other life-saving operations in the Mediterranean this week, and transferred to the Cantabria as it headed towards Italy with its grim cargo. There was no immediate explanation as to why all the dead were women, though the crossing is riskier for them. For every five men who drown in the rubber boats trying to cross the Mediterranean, six women also die, according to migrant expert Sine Plambech, adjunct professor at Columbia University. They can have poorer swimming skills compared to men and their attempts to save their children often lead to their drowning, as does the heavier clothing they wear, he said - 'A tragedy' - \\"It's a tragedy. The prosecutor's office will begin looking into it immediately,\\" Salerno's prefect Salvatore Malfi said. \\"We will need to see whether there are suspects to concentrate on or whether the murder inquiry will proceed against persons unknown,\\" he said. Investigators would be looking for signs of violence against the women, who are believed to have been Nigerian. \\"They were on a dinghy that was also carrying men,\\" Malfi told Italian media in response to fears the doomed vessel may have been a sex-trade boat carrying victims destined for prostitution. \\"The sex trafficking routes are different. Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' -- as they describe them -- in one fell swoop,\\" he said. The Cantabria was also carrying 375 migrants rescued from the waves, including 116 women -- nine of whom were heavily pregnant. According to Italy's interior ministry, more than 111,700 people have reached the country by sea in the first 10 months of 2017, 30 percent down on the previous year. Despite the drop, traffickers are still sending migrant boats out into the Mediterranean: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Friday that more than 2,560 migrants had been saved over four days. In all, 2,839 people have died while attempting the crossing so far this year, it said. ||||| Geneva – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, reports that 150,982 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2017 through 1 November, with about 75 per cent arriving in Italy and the remainder divided between Greece, Cyprus and Spain. This compares with 335,158 arrivals across the region through the same period last year. 2017 marks the fourth straight year migrant arrivals to Europe by sea reached the 150,000-person benchmark, but it is not the earliest time in the year that threshold was reached. In 2016 the Mediterranean region hit that benchmark in early March, and in July in 2015. During the calendar year 2015, there were single months when as many as 150,000 migrants entered by sea, principally through Greece. Nonetheless, this year may shape up as the first year since 2013 that Mediterranean sea crossings by migrants fell short of the 200,000 threshold. Just counting arrivals in Italy and Greece, totals were around 204,000 in 2014 and doubling to 355,000 in 2016 after cresting past one million (1,007,000) in 2015. (See chart below.) IOM Rome reported Thursday (2 November) that 260 migrants were rescued on Tuesday, 31 October, in five different rescue operations, while another 975 were rescued the following day (1 November) in 12 separate rescue operations carried out by Italian and international ships. The remains of eight victims were recovered in waters north of the Libyan coast. IOM Athens’ Kelly Namia reported Thursday (2 November) of at least two incidents this week off the islands of Lesvos requiring search and rescue operations. The Hellenic Coast Guard rescued 147 migrants and transferred them to the two islands. Over 12,400 men, women and children have entered Greece by sea from waters of the Eastern Mediterranean since 1 August, or more migrants than entered during all of 2017’s first seven months. Namia further reported that nearly 800 migrants or refugees entered Greece by sea during the last week of October, bringing migrant sea arrivals to Greek territory to 23,826 for the year so far. (See chart below.) IOM Cyprus’ Dimitrios Tsagalas reported that 34 migrants of Arab origin were picked up in the village of Pyla at Larnaca District this past weekend, in what appears to be growing use of a new pathway into Europe. Cyprus media reported these migrants departed Turkey’s Mersin port by boat Saturday (28 October), reaching Cyprus without detection and travelling by truck to Pyla, a village in the UN Buffer Zone, before crossing into the Republic. All migrants have since been transferred to Purnara’s Reception Centre. According to Republic of Cyprus authorities, this is the seventh recorded incident of crossing via the UN Buffer Zone in 2017. Authorities have recorded 105 migrants using this route to enter the Republic this year. IOM Cyprus notes that the National Plan “NAFKRATIS” – which deals with the management and provision of help to persons in need – has been activated 15 times in 2017, and that a total of 850 migrants have arrived in Cyprus by boat, nearly three times 2016’s total of 345 migrants (through nine months). IOM Libya’s Christine Petré reported Thursday that on 31 October, 299 migrants (231 men, 30 women and 29 children) were rescued from one rubber dinghy off the Libyan capital, Tripoli. IOM assisted at the disembarkation point. She reported one woman had to be transferred to a hospital for further medical assistance. The majority of the migrants came from Guinea Conakry, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon and Senegal. So far in 2017, 19,134 migrants have been rescued or intercepted in Libyan waters, Petré reported. Worldwide, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP) has recorded the deaths of 4,866 people migrating in 2017 – 16 persons per day – with just over eight weeks remaining in the year. Deaths in the Mediterranean Sea continue to account for a majority of the world’s migrant fatalities – now up to 2,839 for the year, or nearly 60 per cent of the 2017 total. Last year at this time the region recorded deaths of 4,150 migrants (see chart below). In the Central Mediterranean this past week, the remains of eight people were recovered Wednesday (1 November) during rescue operations off the coast of Libya. In the Western Mediterranean on Monday (30 October), two young men died after their boat capsized off the coast of Mostaganem in Algeria. The three migrants listed as missing from a shipwreck of 29 October off Tangiers are being counted now as fatalities. Two accidents were recorded in Europe, near the Italian-Austrian border: one migrant lost his life on 30 October in a vehicle accident on the A23 motorway near Udine, in Italy; and another migrant was hit by a train in Bolzano, Italy, on 1 November. Additionally, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project recorded the first death this year off the coast of the Canary Islands: the remains of one man were recovered near Morro Jable in Fuerteventura on 31 October. In Southeast Asia, six Rohingya died and one went missing after two boats carrying dozens of people fleeing violence in Myanmar capsized off the coast of Bangladesh over two days: on 31 October, four Rohingya (a woman and three children), drowned when a small wooden fishing boat capsized off Jaliapalong Union, Ukhiya sub-district. This tragedy came a day after (30 October) a boat carrying approximately 30 Rohingya capsized at Sabrang Union, Teknaf sub-district. Two people died and one remains missing. Since 31 August, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project has recorded the deaths of 249 Rohingya on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is basic to the growth and development of language. Question: Frederick's experiment was extreme because _ . Answer: A:","completion":"Frederick's experiment was extreme because it involved preventing the babies from hearing any language at all by instructing the nurses not to speak to them, which resulted in all the babies' deaths within their first year of life. This level of language deprivation was combined with a lack of good mothering, thereby affecting the babies' survival and development."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: We are always using body language in our daily life. When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'. However, if we do this in France or Belgium, it means 'You're worth zero'. In Greece or Turkey, we should not make this gesture . Or we are thought to be very rude. The meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant 'peace'. However, during World War II, it meant 'victory'. In Greece, it is a very insulting sign. Though the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world, such as smiling and crying.

She had recently moved to the village after her parents inherited a picturesque cottage from her late grandmother. Emily was quick to make friends with the local children, and she discovered that they shared a deep love for adventure. They would often gather after school to explore the woods, the hills, and the nearby lake, creating fond memories as they experienced new sights and sounds. One day, Emily and her friends stumbled upon a mysterious cave hidden in the dense thicket. The entrance was dark and foreboding, enticing them with the alluring prospect of a great adventure. As children filled with curiosity, they couldn't resist the urge to uncover the cave's secrets. Upon entering the cave, they discovered that its walls were adorned with ancient paintings and symbols. The markings seemed to tell a story, perhaps one of treasure and danger hidden within the depths of the cave. The more they ventured, the deeper and more complex the cave's twists and turns became, and their enthusiasm began to wane as a sense of unease grew in their hearts. Determined to follow the adventure to its conclusion, they pushed onward until they found themselves in a cavernous chamber filled with an assortment of dazzling gems and relics of a bygone era. Overcome with a sense of awe, the children couldn't believe their eyes. Could this be the treasure they sought, or was it a clever trap set to ensnare the unwary? Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath them began to tremble. Rocks and debris started to fall from the ceiling, striking fear into their hearts. The cave was beginning to collapse, and they had no idea how to get out. Desperation and panic gripped them as they frantically searched for an exit, the walls of the chamber closing in on them. As they struggled to find their way out, Emily remembered the symbols on the cave walls and recognized a pattern that had eluded her before. Desperate to lead her friends to safety, she instructed them to follow her as she carefully navigated the seemingly endless labyrinth. Their hearts raced as they traversed the hazardous pathways, narrowly avoiding deadly obstacles. Emily's intuition and newfound understanding of the ancient symbols guided them through the darkness and back towards the entrance. Having only faith and trust in their friend, they pressed on. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of fear and chaos, Emily and her friends emerged from the cave, just as the last of the cave's passages collapsed with a thunderous roar. Out in the safety of the warm sunlight, the children hugged each other tightly, tears streaming down their faces. They knew that they had just escaped certain doom, and in the face of overwhelming adversity, their bond of friendship had grown stronger.

When using coconut oil on your hair, choose virgin or unrefined coconut oil. These coconut oils are less processed with no added chemicals, so they contain more nutrients that are beneficial and safer for your hair. High quality coconut oils are pure white when solid and clear when liquid. You can use either a solid or a liquid coconut oil as long as it is high quality. If your coconut oil is in solid form (as most products will be when you purchase them), warm 2 to 8 tablespoons (120 mL) on the stove or in the microwave until the solid has turned into a liquid. Remove the oil from the heat right when it has melted completely–you do not want the oil to get too hot, as you will be applying it to your hair. The amount you use is entirely based on how much hair you have. If you have short hair that is above your chin, for example, begin with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil. If you have long, thick hair, you may need up to 8 tablespoons (120 mL) to cover your whole head. Before applying the oil to your hair, gently touch the surface of the melted oil with your finger to make sure that it has not gotten too hot. If the oil is uncomfortably hot to the touch, wait a few minutes and test it again. Once the coconut oil has melted, dip your fingers into the oil and gently message it into a section of your hair for about 1 minute. Repeat this until all your hair is covered in the coconut oil. It might be a good idea to wear clothes that you don’t mind staining with oil, or you can wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. You can also apply the oil to your hair by slowly pouring it onto your head. To avoid making a mess, do this either in the shower or pour slowly while holding your head over the sink. To give the oil enough time to strengthen and add shine to your hair, leave it to rest in your hair for at least 30 minutes. You can leave your hair uncovered, or you can protect your clothes and surroundings by putting on a shower cap, or by lightly wrapping your hair in a towel. If your hair is particularly dry, you can leave the coconut oil in your hair overnight. To do this, cover your hair with a towel or shower cap. You may also want to cover your pillow with a towel so that the oil does not stain your pillowcase. After leaving the coconut oil to condition your hair for at least 30 minutes, wash it out thoroughly with your regular shampoo. If your hair tends to absorb a lot of product, you may need to shampoo more than once to keep your hair from looking oily after. Coconut oil tends to weigh a bit heavily in hair, so you will likely want to skip using a bottled conditioner for at least one wash after the coconut oil wash. For best results, apply coconut oil to your hair every week. If your hair is particularly damaged or dry, you can use a coconut oil conditioning mask up to 3 times per week. If your hair is oily, however, you will likely want to stick to 1 treatment per week. Summary:","completion":"Choose high-quality virgin or unrefined coconut oil for hair, melt the desired amount, apply evenly, and leave it on for at least 30 minutes or overnight before washing out for strengthened, shiny hair."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period.

It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music. Vibrato is typically characterised in terms of two factors: the amount of pitch variation (\\"extent of vibrato\\") and the speed with which the pitch is varied (\\"rate of vibrato\\"). - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Maurice Ernest Gibb, CBE (22 December 1949 12 January 2003) was a British singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer, who achieved fame as a member of the British pop group the Bee Gees. Although his brothers Barry and Robin Gibb were the group's main lead singers, most of their albums included at least one or two Gibb compositions, including \\"Lay It on Me\\", \\"Country Woman\\" and \\"On Time\\". The Bee Gees were one of the most successful rock-pop groups ever. Gibb's role in the group focused on melody and arrangements, providing backing vocal harmony and playing a variety of instruments. - The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their line-up consisted of brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.

Which one is a better option: 1. appearing for CAT or 2. appearing for GMAT? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To provide the best advice on whether CAT or GMAT is tougher and which one is a better option, I will first gather information about both exams and compare them based on various factors. Step 1: Research and gather information about the CAT CAT (Common Admission Test) is a national-level entrance exam conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to screen candidates for admission into MBA (Masters in Business Administration) and PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) courses at various management institutions across India. Step 2: Research and gather information about the GMAT GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a standardized global business entrance exam conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). It is primarily created for admissions into international Business schools. However, some Indian institutions also accept GMAT scores for their MBA and PGDM programs. Step 3: Compare difficulty levels The difficulty levels of the CAT and GMAT can be quite subjective. However, some aspects can be compared: 1. CAT often emphasizes more on quantitative aptitude and time management, while GMAT emphasizes verbal and analytical skills. Some students may find quant-heavy CAT more challenging, whereas others may find GMAT more challenging due to a focus on verbal and analytical skills. 2. GMAT includes an Analytical Writing Assessment, which demands good essay writing skills that CAT does not have. It's important to identify your strengths and weaknesses to decide which exam may be more challenging for you. Step 4: Evaluate personal and professional goals The choice between CAT and GMAT comes down to individual preferences, goals, and aspirations. 1. If you aspire to study in a top Indian B-school and are specifically targeting IIMs or other prestigious management institutions in India, CAT would be a better option. 2. If you aim for an international MBA at leading global Business schools, or if you want to keep your options open for both Indian and international schools, GMAT is the better choice. Step 5: Assess the questions The questions you asked, 1. \\"CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?\\" - it compares the difficulty level of the two exams. 2. \\"Which one is a better option: appearing for CAT or appearing for GMAT?\\" - it asks for advice on which exam would suit the individual based on their goals and aspirations. These questions are not the same, although related. They address different aspects of the decision-making process for choosing between CAT and GMAT. In conclusion, the choice between CAT and GMAT depends on your personal strengths, weaknesses, and long-term goals. Consider these factors and assess which exam aligns better with your aspirations before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the...

Payable on Death (abbreviated P.O.D.) is a Christian nu metal band formed in 1992 and based in San Diego, California. The band's line-up consists of vocalist Sonny Sandoval, drummer and rhythm guitarist Wuv Bernardo, lead guitarist Marcos Curiel, and bassist Traa Daniels. They have sold over 12 million records worldwide. Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. The band headlined the first annual Spring Jam Fest in May 2011. They appeared on the Rock of Allegiance tour later that summer. On July 25, 2011, the band released a demo of the song \\"On Fire\\" as a free download on their official website. In October 2011, P.O.D. announced a multi-album artist deal with Razor & Tie. On April 5, 2012, the song \\"Eyez\\" became a free download on the band's website for a limited time. Shortly after, an article on their website stated that \\"Lost in Forever\\" would be the first single from the new album, entitled Murdered Love. Murdered Love was originally going to be released in June 2012, but was instead pushed back to July 10. The album was produced by Howard Benson, who also produced Satellite and The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. It was described by Curiel as \\"Back to our roots. A little bit of hip hop, a little bit of punk rock, or reggae\\". The band went on tour with Shinedown and Three Days Grace as an opening act. In a 2012 interview with Broken Records Magazine, Sandoval said that the band had to get their lives back in order and take care of personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely happy about the response the band was getting from fans. On October 22, 2013, P.O.D. released a deluxe edition of Murdered Love. The album contains the original songs, slightly remixed, along with bonus tracks \\"Find a Way\\", \\"Burn It Down\\", acoustic versions of \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"West Coast Rock Steady\\", a remixed version of \\"On Fire\\", and music videos for \\"Murdered Love\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Higher\\", and \\"Lost In Forever\\".

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"Before the restoration of Portuguese control, what Portuguese holdings were taken over by the British and the Dutch?\\" Answer: \\"Many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil)\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Quite mad: If Casey shared information that caused parents to become upset or angry, perhaps it was sensitive or confidential news about their children that they were not expecting or did not want to hear. People might feel mad if the information was perceived as intrusive or offensive. B. Very nice: If Casey shared helpful and supportive information that the parents appreciated, then others might feel happy and appreciative with the effort. The information could have been about resolving a situation, providing solutions, or offering support to the parents. In this scenario, such kind of information could make others feel reassured and positive about the situation. C. Very sad: If the information shared by Casey was tragic or disheartening, it could make others feel very sad.

The principal cities are Fredericton, the capital, Greater Moncton, currently the largest metropolitan (CMA) area and the most populous city, and the port city of Saint John, which was the first incorporated city in Canada and largest in the province for 231 years until 2016. In the Canada 2016 Census, Statistics Canada estimated the provincial population to have been 747,101, down very slightly from 751,171 in 2011, on an area of almost 73,000 km. The majority of the population is English-speaking of Anglo and Celtic heritage, but there is also a large Francophone minority (31%), chiefly of Acadian origin. It was created as a result of the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 with the capital in Saint John before being moved up river. The name 'New Brunswick' was chosen by King George III despite local recommendations for the name to be 'New Ireland'. The provincial flag features a ship superimposed on a yellow background with a yellow \\"lion passant guardant\\" on red pennon above it.

Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang.

Answer the following question: - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in the kidneys, also known as renal filtration, begins with blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery. The renal artery branches off the aorta, which is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. When blood reaches the kidneys, it begins its journey through the nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney contains over a million nephrons, made up of a glomerulus, a tiny cluster of capillaries, and a tubule. Within the nephron, the renal filtration process can be broken down into several stages: 1. Glomerular filtration: Blood enters the glomerulus, where high blood pressure forces water, salts, glucose, amino acids, and nitrogenous waste like urea and uric acid out of the blood and into the nearby Bowman's capsule. This process separates the smaller molecules from the larger ones, such as blood cells and proteins that are too large to pass through the tiny capillary walls. 2. Tubular reabsorption: As the fluid, now called the filtrate, passes through the renal tubule, essential nutrients, ions, and water are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the peritubular capillaries. This process maintains the body's electrolyte balance and ensures that vital substances are not lost in the urine. 3. Tubular secretion: Some substances, like hydrogen ions, potassium ions, and certain drugs, are actively secreted from the peritubular capillaries and into the renal tubule. This helps to regulate blood pH and eliminate any unwanted substances from the body. 4. Concentration and dilution of the filtrate: As the filtrate moves through the Loop of Henle, the descending limb allows water to pass out of the filtrate while the ascending limb actively transports salts out of the filtrate and into the surrounding tissue. This concentrates the urine and helps to maintain the appropriate concentration of salts in the body. 5. Collection and excretion: The concentrated filtrate, now considered urine, continues to flow through the distal convoluted tubule, where any last necessary adjustments to the composition of the urine are made. The urine then enters the collecting duct and finally exits the kidney through the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra. In conclusion, the first step of the process is blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery, which carries oxygenated blood to the nephrons. The high blood pressure in the glomerulus forces water, salts, glucose, amino acids, and nitrogenous waste out of the blood and into the Bowman's capsule, effectively starting the renal filtration process. The kidney's exceptional ability to filter waste, prevent the loss of vital substances, and regulate the body's chemical composition makes these organs crucial to maintaining our overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wash the skillet thoroughly: Wash the cast iron with warm water and mild dish soap. Scrub with bristle brush, gentle scouring pad, or mesh sponge if needed.; Answer:","completion":"II.

The correct answer is option II, and here's why: Option I is incorrect because it says to scour the skillet until the area returns to \\"new cast iron.\\" This wording suggests removing the entire seasoning layer, which is not the goal in this process. Option II is the correct answer because it instructs you to scour the skillet until the area is back to raw cast iron. This means that you are only removing the portions affected by rust while keeping the rest of the seasoning intact. This process ensures that the cast iron skillet maintains the much-appraised non-stick surface that it develops after the seasoning process.

Seeking answers and redemption, he frequently visits the docks, the last place he saw Jamie alive. However, the more time he spends there, the deeper he gets entangled in a thrilling web of crime, deceit, and violence. Plot: The story takes place in a small coastal town where Landon, a skilled former naval officer, has returned after dishonorable discharge due to a tragic accident. He's haunted by the death of his best friend Jamie, who mysteriously died at the docks during their last night together. Landon feels responsible for Jamie's death, as he left him alone that night to deal with a personal crisis. Landon's days pass in sorrow, lost in memories of Jamie and their adventures as Navy SEALs. At night, he frequents the docks for solace. One day, Landon meets Rebecca, a marine biologist working on a project near the docks. As they bond over their shared love for the sea, Rebecca gradually becomes a source of emotional support for Landon.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Pharrell Williams Takes a Stand on Cheery Musical Ground It can probably all be explained by the hat, the indelible success of Pharrell Williams. The hat, of course, is the signature Vivienne Westwood mountain hat that he wore to the Grammys in January. Sitting atop his head as if it were pasted on with adhesive, the hat — part cowboy, part park ranger — added several inches to his height and several months to his cultural relevance. With one small stroke — almost an afterthought, given that he’d bought the hat several years before — Mr. Williams managed to redraw himself completely. That night, he was a performer, a winner several times over, including for producer of the year, and also a very slick, gentle disruption. But that is Mr. Williams in a nutshell: taking an old idea, something that’s been in currency for quite some time, and, with a touch of panache and a willingness to look slightly out of place, make it seem utterly new. He makes the familiar seem idiosyncratic. Now 40, Mr. Williams has been producing and writing songs for over two decades, first a force in hip-hop and R&B, and later in pop. After a brief lull out of the spotlight, he’s been one of the most transformative music figures of the last year, with his hands on two of 2013’s biggest singles, Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky.” And now there’s “G I R L” (Columbia), his second album as a solo performer. It’s intensely catchy and harmlessly empty, and succeeds largely because of Mr. Williams’s bravery at standing firm on territory no one else is trying to claim. The sunny “G I R L” — which Mr. Williams wrote, produced and sung almost in its entirety — reaches back to the utopian black pop of the ’70s and early ’80s, full of soft funk and cushy soul. It’s an overwhelmingly positive album, cheery in mood and instrumentation, as if Mr. Williams knows something the rest of us do not. Take “Happy,” which first appeared on the soundtrack of “Despicable Me 2” and which is nominated for best original song at the Oscars on Sunday, at which Mr. Williams will also perform. The song is unrelentingly bright, like a peek of unfiltered sun between clouds on an overcast day. “Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof,” Mr. Williams sings. “Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth.” Were you so inclined — and certainly you are not — you could watch the 24-hour video for the song, with guest appearances from Jamie Foxx, Jimmy Kimmel and the rap collective Odd Future, among others. Again, this is 24 literal hours of happiness, punishment-level glee. And yet “Happy,” which is out of lock step with almost the whole of pop music, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Mr. Williams may be the most prominent pop music figure to have identified a bubbling shift away from cynicism in youth culture, or he may be the first person to make adult-contemporary pop that actually sounds contemporary. Either way, he manages to tap into broad pleasures while coming off like a minimalist or an aesthete. There are moments of musical ostentation on “G I R L,” but they are few. Instead, Mr. Williams delivers a gut check of pared-down R&B and disco with almost military rigor. “Lost Queen” is among the highlights — a virtual lullaby, with nods to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” Dance-floor strings pulse vibrantly through “Gust of Wind,” “Gush” and “Marilyn Monroe.” “I Know Who You Are” has the faintest contour of lovers-rock reggae, with Alicia Keys singing dully about empowerment. (In fairness, Ms. Keys’s voice was not built for subtlety.) “Brand New,” with its wanton Jackson 5 horn homage, shows that Mr. Williams hasn’t been too troubled by the lawsuit filed by the heirs of Marvin Gaye, who alleged that “Blurred Lines” was too derivative of Mr. Gaye’s work without proper remuneration. Justin Timberlake sings on this song, and Mr. Williams manages to de-emphasize him, turning an unfair vocal fight into a clear victory for Mr. Williams. None of the ideas on these songs are original, but they are for the most part out of fashion, and therefore Mr. Williams’s boldness and facility with them feels refreshing. The album is a light massage, fingertips gently brushing your back, a reminder of deeper and more nuanced pleasure. Mr. Williams has always been a believer in sketches. Most of the genre-shifting beats he made as half of the Neptunes (alongside Chad Hugo) — Clipse’s “Grindin’,” Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” and so many more — were mere outlines, emphatic in their simplicity. Mr. Williams is an expert at pointing a listener in a direction, then stepping out of the way, confident that the rest of the path is clear. In his music and his public presentation, Mr. Williams glows with an incandescent calm that’s part naïve, part smug — where he is is the only place he can be — and exactly where everyone else should be. The most vital comparison point for “G I R L” may be its opposite, the other extreme black pop album of the last year, Kanye West’s “Yeezus,” a stern album through and through. “G I R L” is in many ways the anti-“Yeezus” (though both albums have a dirty streak). Mr. Williams and Mr. West have grown up in parallel, though Mr. Williams’s ability to transform pop predates Mr. West’s. While Mr. Williams helped set the table for Mr. West’s avant-gardeness, he has never craved it for himself. Instead, he’s satisfied with being contemporary pop’s great reconciler. He has worked with Britney Spears, Mystikal and Hans Zimmer. He was a spirit guide for Miley Cyrus during her recent transition from country-inclined post-Disney upstart to salacious pop phenom. Mr. Williams produced a pair of songs on her album “Bangerz” (RCA), and she returns the favor here with guest vocals on “Come Get It Bae.” As a performer, Mr. Williams is a true chameleon, but he has no natural home. He’s a tremendous accent piece, but can you build a room around him? He has a neutral, almost ahistoric voice. He’s not a powerful singer — so many times on this album, his vocals are thickened, bolstered with harmonies, and so on. His tone is unmistakable, but his force is on loan. And there’s nothing gnomic about his lyrics — coming from almost anyone else, they’d be pilloried for excess simplicity. Plenty of times on this album, he sings lines that are vexing: “ ‘Duck Dynasty’ is cool and all/ But they got nothing on the female’s call,” on “Hunter.” On “Marilyn Monroe,” he sings lyrics that sound like Mad Libs: “We cannot help who/We’re attracted to/So let’s all dance and elevate each other.” Instead, where Mr. Williams excels is in pacing and rhythm, and finding pockets of delivery that feel intuitive, or at least lined so deeply with historical memory that they’re instantly familiar and comforting. He sings in a percussive manner, full of vocal stabs, and his voice congeals easily into a sweet coo, precise and seemingly effortless. Mr. Williams has released one other solo album — “In My Mind” (Star Trak/Interscope), in 2006. This was a different Pharrell — mostly a rapper, a wry braggart, bawdy and thrilled to get away with it. He hadn’t yet transcended category. But Mr. Williams has shifted the culture in a fashion similar to “G I R L” once before. As the Neptunes were reaching their commercial peak as pop and hip-hop producers, they chose to spend that clout by effectively reformatting (with the addition of a vocalist) into a rock band, N.E.R.D. The debut N.E.R.D. album, “In SearchOf ...” (Virgin), originally released in 2001, was a brilliant hodgepodge of rock, soul, electro, hip-hop and more, the tablet on which Mr. Williams laid out his polyglot vision. It had no clear precursor, and no clear peers. And though it wasn’t a breakthrough commercial success, it’s been a quiet influence in the years since. Like “G I R L,” and like that hat, that, too, was something dug out from the back of the closet, a backward look that turned out to be the way forward.","completion":"Pharrell Williams is a famous singer who has been making music for over 20 years. He wore a unique hat at the Grammy Awards, which made him even more popular. His latest album, \\"G I R L,\\" is a mix of old ideas in music, but makes it feel new and fresh. It has a happy and positive vibe, making it different from much of pop music today. Even though he's not a powerful singer, his sense of rhythm and pacing in songs make them catchy and fun. Pharrell's talent lies in bringing together different styles of music and making people feel good while listening to his songs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Question: what is the main source of power in today's america factories?? Would \\"These advantages are global.\\" be a reasonable answer? Options: (a). No (b). Yes The answer is:","completion":"(a). No The main source of power in today's American factories is not suitably addressed by the statement \\"These advantages are global.\\" This answer does not provide any information about the actual source of power that drives American industries. A detailed answer to the question would be as follows: The main source of power in American factories today comes from a mix of energy sources, including fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear power, and renewable sources. The most common among these sources is electricity, which is generated from various means and serves as an essential utility for most industries in the United States. For many years, coal and natural gas were the dominant sources of power for American factories, providing reliable and affordable power options for industry. However, recent years have seen a shift towards more sustainable energy sources due to environmental concerns, government regulations, and technological advancements. Currently, natural gas has become a more prominent player in the American energy mix since it is a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal. The increased production and availability of shale gas have contributed to the increase in natural gas use. Moreover, we see an increasing focus on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. These energy sources are beneficial for the environment and provide stable energy costs over time. In addition, many factories utilize cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) systems, which generate electricity and thermal energy simultaneously, to maximize overall energy efficiency. CHP systems come in various sizes and can be powered by natural gas, biomass, or other energy sources. As the manufacturing industries continue to evolve in today's America, there is a growing consciousness for eco-friendly energy solutions, improving energy efficiency, and minimizing carbon emissions. This shift enables the adoption of a mix of power sources incorporating conventional energy resources such as fossil fuels and nuclear power with renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power to maintain a stable supply of power to American factories. So, while the statement \\"These advantages are global.\\" suggests that there may be universally accepted benefits in the context of the question, it does not identify the primary source of power in American factories or provide specific details.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of person was Kat's mom before she got married? ? In 1988, when Katrina \\"Kat\\" Connors was 17, her beautiful but mercurial mother, Eve, disappeared without a trace. The story weaves back-and-forth with flashbacks of Eve's past life and the present day. In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker. The detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating. Kat dismisses this theory, just like she did three years ago, but after mentioning the topic to her friends Beth and Mickey they tell her they suggested this same theory to her and she dismissed them as well. Kat suspects Phil of having slept with Eve and confronts him the night before she is to return to college, but Phil angrily rebuffs it and tells her that her father knows where her mother is. A:","completion":"Before Kat's mother Eve got married, she was depicted as a wild and free-spirited individual. The narrative suggests that Eve was a vivacious and lively character, embodying the spirit of youth and rebelliousness. She was the kind of individual who lived life on her own terms without caring much about social norms or societal structure. This rebellious streak is evident from the fact that she was described as a \\"wild girl\\" during her past life in the flashbacks. This descriptor indicates that she was possibly outgoing, uncontained, and loved adventure, typical characteristics of someone who is considered 'wild'. Moreover, Eve seems to have had a capability to attract attention on her terms, evidenced by the fact that she was described as 'beautiful' and 'mercurial.' Her beauty was a defining trait that she carried even after marriage, using it to maintain her appeal and allure in her ongoing struggle with age. The term 'mercurial' denotes 'quick and changeable in temperament,' which suggests Eve was a person characterized by unpredictability, changeability, and impulsive behavior. This further reinforces the idea of her wild and free-spirited nature. However, with marriage to Brock, a man described as ordinary and leading an 'uneventful' life, her 'wild' personality gradually became domesticated, signaling a shift from her earlier outgoing character to a more home-centered life. Even after this transition, it's worth noting that the 'wild' edge was never truly erased from her character, as she still sought to keep alive her youthful wildness and behaved in a seductive manner when her husband Brock was away. This duality in her nature indicates that Eve was a complex character with a mix of qualities - initially nonconformist and vivacious, who turned into a housewife but still sought fun and adventure, suggesting a struggle to conform to her role fully. Therefore, prior to her marriage, Kat's mother Eve was essentially a beautiful, mercurial, and wild woman."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is up on posthumous heresy charges due to his controversial writings. Apparently, Vatican authorities are trying to modernize and do not want to acknowledge that Satan as an actual evil entity exists.Meanwhile, the teenage Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with her guardian Sharon Spencer in New York while her mother is away on location filming a movie, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Regan claims she remembers nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C., but Tuskin believes her memories are only buried or repressed. Father Lamont visits the institute but his attempts to question Regan about the circumstances of Father Merrin's death are rebuffed by Dr. Tuskin, believing that Lamont's approach would do Regan more harm than good.

Write an article based on this summary: Fill out pro and con columns on a sheet of paper. Keep emotional distance from the issue you’re evaluating. Consider how the “cons” can be overcome.","completion":"Title: A Balanced Approach: Utilizing Pro and Con Lists for Effective Decision-Making Introduction In a world where decisions are the stepping stones towards success, it is essential to approach them with a level head and clear perspective. One classic and effective technique to help individuals and businesses analyze complex issues is the creation of pro and con lists. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to utilize pro and con lists for well-informed decision-making, remaining emotionally detached from the issue, and overcoming potential setbacks. Step 1: Fill out Pro and Con Columns on a Sheet of Paper The first and most basic step in creating a pro and con list is to take a sheet of paper and divide it into two columns. Label one column \\"Pros\\" and the other column \\"Cons.\\" Write down every conceivable advantage and disadvantage you can think of for the issue you're evaluating. It is helpful to consider both short-term and long-term implications. Step 2: Keep Emotional Distance from the Issue As humans, it is natural to have an emotional attachment to the decisions we make. However, emotions can cloud our judgment and lead to choices that may not be the most beneficial in the long run. To effectively utilize pro and con lists, it is essential to distinguish personal feelings or biases from logical reasoning. By focusing on facts and objective criteria, you can make a well-rounded decision that weighs the option's effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Step 3: Consider How the \\"Cons\\" Can Be Overcome One common drawback in using pro and con lists is the tendency to view the \\"Cons\\" column as insurmountable barriers. However, it's important to remember that many of these obstacles can be overcome or mitigated with proper planning and resources. After completing your list, dedicate time to actively brainstorming strategies and solutions to address each drawback. This proactive approach helps paint a clearer picture of the overall feasibility, enabling you to make a more informed decision. Conclusion Employing pro and con lists as a decision-making tool is a simple yet powerful practice that paves the way for intentional and informed choices. The key to unlocking the full potential of pro and con lists lies in maintaining an emotional distance from the issue under consideration while taking a balanced view of the advantages and drawbacks. Transforming obstacles into opportunities through strategic problem-solving can optimize the decision-making process and yield satisfying and successful outcomes—both personally and professionally."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In early March, the administration postponed action on proposals for increasing aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.

Over the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year. In 1661 Louis XIV, who was particularly hostile to the Huguenots, started assuming control of his government and began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict. In 1681 he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"From the information provided, we can delve into multiple aspects of the relationship between political decisions and religious tensions in the period of Louis XIII and Louis XIV in France. Notably, the course of action they took affected not only the Huguenots but also impacted the politics, economy, and social dynamics of the country. Starting from Louis XIII's reign, the implementation of the Edict of Nantes, which granted certain rights to the Huguenots, varied wildly based on the contemporary political climate. After Louis XIII's death, his son, Louis XIV, started to gain control of France. Known for his hostility towards the Huguenots, Louis XIV began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict, thus weakening the protections it offered to the Protestants. This shift in approach was notably apparent in 1661, marking the start of a gradually intensifying campaign against Protestantism in France. In 1681, Louis XIV furthered his efforts to suppress the Huguenots by implementing the policy of dragonnades. This policy employed the use of military troops, specifically dragoons, to pressure Huguenot families into converting to Roman Catholicism or leaving the country under the threat of violence and harassment. The dragonnades, while not explicitly outlawing Protestantism, made life very uncomfortable for Huguenots, pushing them towards a difficult choice of religious compromise or migration. However, Louis XIV took the final and most significant step against the Huguenots in October 1685, with the issuance of the Edict of Fontainebleau. This edict affected a complete turnaround, revoking the Edict of Nantes and making Protestantism illegal in France. Consequently, this move stripped Huguenots of their previously acknowledged religious and civil rights, pushing religious tolerance in France to a breaking point. The revocation had severe repercussions for France. While it did not lead to renewed religious warfare, it still prompted a wave of migration from France. Many Huguenots chose to leave the country rather than convert to Catholicism. These individuals primarily found refuge in regions like Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic, and Switzerland where Protestantism was more prevalent and accepted. Notwithstanding the exodus, a significant population of Protestants remained in France, specifically in the Cévennes region of the Massif Central. Known as the Camisards, this group of Protestants initiated a resistance against the government in response to Louis XIV's anti-Protestant policies. They launched a revolt in 1702, leading to intermittent skirmishes that didn't conclusively end until 1715. Despite continued oppression, the government substantially reduced their assault on the Camisards post-1715. In conclusion, the religious policies under the reign of Louis XIII and Louis XIV significantly influenced the practice of Protestantism in France. From fluctuating enforcement of the Edict of Nantes, through the intimidation campaigns of dragonnades, to the final revocation of the Edict, their reigns marked a dramatic curbing of religious liberty and the resulting migration and revolt. These events underline the profound impacts of politics on religious freedom and societal dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: A Charlotte, N.C., man was charged with first-degree murder of a 79-year-old woman whom police said he scared to death. In an attempt to evade policemen after a bank robbery, the Associated Press reports that 20-year-old Larry Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell. Police say he didn't touch Parnell but that she died after suffering a heart attack that was caused by terror. Can the guy be held responsible for the woman's death? Prosecutors said that he can under the state's murder rule, which allows someone to be charged with murder if he or she causes another person's death while committing or fleeing from a severe crime like robbery--even if he or she doesn't kill someone on purpose. But, medically speaking, can someone actually be frightened to death? We asked Martin Samuels, chairman of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Absolutely, no question about it. The body has a natural protective method called the fight-or-flight response , which was originally described by Walter Cannon,the chairman of Harvard University's physiology department from 1906 to 1942. If, in the wild, an animal is faced with a life-threatening situation, the autonomic nervous system responds by increasing heart rate, increasing blood flow to the muscles, and slowing digestion, among other things. All of this increases the chances of succeeding in a fight or running away from an aggressive beast. This process certainly would be of help to primitive humans. However, in the modern world there is obvious decline of the fight-or-flight response. The autonomic nervous system uses the chemical messenger to send signals to various parts of the body to activate the fight-or-flight response. This chemical is toxic in large amounts; it damages the organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. It is believed that almost all sudden deaths are caused by damage to the heart. There is almost no other organ that would fail so fast as to cause sudden death. Kidney failure, liver failure, those things... Question: Why the Charlotte, N.C., man was charged?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: How do geese normally get from place to place? Possible A: carried by people, guard house, fly, follow ultralight airplane, group together Why is \\"fly\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Fly\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects the most natural and predominant form of locomotion exhibited by geese. Geese, like many species of birds, rely primarily on their ability to fly when moving to different locations, whether it be for the purposes of migration, foraging, or simply moving around within their habitat. Flying is not only an essential aspect of geese's biological and anatomical makeup but also plays a critical role in their survival and adaptation to various environments. In contrast, the other possible answers given do not conform to the same level of common sense understanding, and here are the reasons why: 1. Carried by people: Geese are wild animals, and in general, they do not rely on humans for transportation. While it is true that domesticated geese or injured/geese under rehabilitation might occasionally be carried by humans, this is not the norm for geese as a species. Therefore, considering this an expected mode of transportation for geese would not align with human common sense. 2. Guard house: This answer does not pertain to any form of transportation but instead refers to a general concept of geese being used as \\"guard animals\\" due to their territorial and protective nature when they are on the ground. This doesn't explain how they get from place to place, so it does not make sense from a human common sense perspective. 3. Follow ultralight airplane: While there have been instances of researchers using ultralight aircraft to guide migratory birds like geese, this is an artificial and rare event that is not representative of how geese naturally get from one place to another. Though it can be an interesting example, human common sense understands that geese primarily rely on their innate ability to fly rather than following external devices or human-made objects for navigation. 4. Group together: Though geese do form groups, known as flocks or gaggles, when traveling, this answer does not address the actual mode of transportation utilized by geese. Grouping together is a behavior exhibited by geese during their journey, but it's not how they literally move from one place to another, so it does not align with human common sense as a complete answer. In summary, the reason \\"fly\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense is that it is the most accurate, widespread, and natural method of transportation employed by geese. Flying is an intrinsic part of their life cycle and a primary means of getting from place to place that has evolved over time to ensure their survival, adaptation, and continuation as a species. Other suggested answers either inaccurately describe the natural behavior of geese or only provide a partial understanding of their movement strategies, making \\"fly\\" the most reasonable and logical answer from a human common sense standpoint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period. The Pennsylvania period is separated by the drop in Carboniferous era sea levels from what other period?","completion":"Alright, let me make this simple for you. There were two important periods of time long, long ago - the Mississippian Period and the Pennsylvanian Period. They both happened during a big time called the Carboniferous Era.

Question: who makes good investments? Movie title: Brewster's Millions Movie plot: Monty Brewster is a Minor League Baseball pitcher with the Hackensack Bulls. He and his best friend Spike Nolan, the Bulls' catcher, are arrested after a post-game bar fight and cannot afford bail. A stranger offers bail, if they will come to New York City with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville &amp; Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, whom he has never met, has left him his entire fortune but with several conditions. Brewster is challenged to either take 1 million upfront, or spend 30 million within 30 days to inherit 300 million. If he chooses the former, the law firm becomes the executor of the estate and divides the money among charities (after taking a fee). In the latter case, after 30 days, he may not own any assets that are not already his, and he must get value for the services of anyone he hires. He may donate only 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling, and he may not waste the money by purchasing and destroying valuable items. Finally, he is not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. If he fails to spend the entire 30 million, he forfeits the balance and inherits nothing. Brewster decides to take the 30 million challenge, and Angela Drake, a paralegal from the law firm, is assigned to accompany him and keep track of his spending. Brewster, who has no concept of money (never having earned more than 11,000 a year), rents an expensive hotel suite at the Plaza Hotel, hires personal staff on exorbitant salaries, and places bad bets. However, Spike makes good investments, earning Brewster money.

In 1983, a major revision of the constitution was undertaken, almost fully rewriting the text and adding new civil rights. The text is very sober, devoid of legal or political doctrine. It includes a bill of rights. The constitution prohibits the judiciary to test laws and treaties against the constitution, as this is considered a prerogative of the legislature. There is no constitutional court in the Netherlands, except for the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten which only governs the Sint Maarten legislator.

Article: A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently from other ones. Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \\"staff\\", in an object. Another kind of black hole is called \\"stellar\\" . Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called \\"supermassive\\" . These black holes have masses that are more than one million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large _ contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy has a mass equal to about four million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or falls apart. When this happens, it exploded part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in. A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the black hole. But scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole. Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting a black hole. When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light cannot be seen with human...

Article: On a Saturday morning earlier this September, the world got its first look at the Strati. This electric vehicle is unlike any other currently on the road. It rolls on four wheels, but its body and chassis weren't built in a factory. Instead, Strati's designers used a technology called 3-D printing. It created those parts of the car in one piece, from the ground up. \\"Compared to a typical vehicle on the road, the Strati definitely looks different,\\" says Greg Schroeder, a senior research engineer at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. He did not work on the new car. His organization studies trends and changes in the auto industry. It took 44 hours to print the new car at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. Over the next few days, the car's designers installed additional parts. These included the car's engine, brakes and tires. Then, early on September 13, Jay Rogers climbed into the car, started its engine and drove the vehicle onto the street. Rogers helped found Local Motors. It's the Arizona-based company behind the Strati. Two weeks later, his team printed a second Strati, and just as fast, at a fair in New York City. Justin Fishkin, a local Motors official, sees the Strati as a window into the future. Today, car buyers are limited in their choice of a vehicle. They can order only what car companies have already designed. But in the future, he says, you may be able to design your own car online and then get it printed to order. Manufacturing experts say 3-D printing has begun to revolutionize how they make things. The technology has been around for decades. But these machines used to be so expensive that only large companies could afford them. In the last few years, though, that has changed. Many of the machines are now inexpensive enough for small companies--or even individuals --to own. Some local libraries make them available to the public. High Schools are beginning to use them in classrooms. Wide access to these printers means people can now design and print... Question: Which of the following statements about the first Strati is TRUE? Options: A: It was born in a car factory in Chicago. B: All parts of it were not made by using a technology called 3-D technology. C: It is a pity that it has not run on the street so far.

The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Authorities in Baton Rouge said Tuesday that they have arrested a white man in the fatal shooting of two black men in separate incidents last week. Police have described the shootings as potentially racially motivated. On Tuesday, while announcing the arrest and charges, officials also said that the suspect may be linked to a third shooting last week, as well — this one targeting a home with black residents. Two people were inside, but they were unharmed, Hillar C. Moore III, the district attorney in East Baton Rouge, said at a news conference. Moore said the man in custody — Kenneth James Gleason — is thought to have fired at the two men killed last week while inside his car before getting out, standing over them and firing additional shots. “It appears to be cold, calculated, planned,” Moore said, adding that the attacks targeted “people who were unarmed and defenseless.” [Two apparently random shootings in Baton Rouge could be racially motivated, police say] The Baton Rouge police chief said Tuesday that Gleason’s arrest in the “brutal murders” last week probably saved lives because the 23-year-old “would’ve probably killed again.” Gleason — who had been arrested, released and rearrested during the investigation — could face the death penalty, Moore said. Although officials have not definitively announced a motive, citing the ongoing investigation, they said earlier that the two killings could have been racially motivated. Gleason has spoken to authorities, Moore said, but the prosecutor declined to elaborate on what was said. The first known fatal shooting occurred Tuesday, Sept. 12, when Bruce Cofield was killed, according to authorities. Cofield, a homeless man known to people in the community, was fatally shot late that night. Two days later, police say, Donald Smart was found with fatal gunshot wounds. Smart was a popular employee at Louie’s Cafe, a diner near the Louisiana State University campus. A third shooting predated Cofield and Smart’s deaths, Moore said when outlining a timeline in the case at the news conference. On Monday, Sept. 11, Moore said, Gleason fired three shots from a 9mm gun at an occupied home not far from his own. Kenneth Gleason, 23, escorted to jail in Philmont shirt, a Boy Scout camp. He's been connected to 2 killings, possibly racially motivated pic.twitter.com/uNa3tuRPDl — Grace Toohey (@grace_2e) September 19, 2017 Gleason was booked Tuesday in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on counts of first-degree murder, illegal use of a weapon and aggravated criminal damage to property. “He strongly denies the allegations, and he will be vindicated,” Chris Alexander, Gleason’s attorney, wrote in an email Tuesday. The shootings come as racial tension has flared up across the country recently, erupting in violence in places such as New York, where a white man fatally stabbed a black man he encountered on the street; Portland, Ore., where two men were fatally stabbed while trying to intervene when a train passenger began shouting anti-Muslim hate speech; and Kansas, where a man was indicted on hate-crime charges in the fatal shooting of one Indian man and wounding of another. Baton Rouge has also seen its share of violence and unrest, with an increasing number of homicides this year. Last year, the city was also the site of heated protests after police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a black man, outside a grocery store; two weeks later, three officers were gunned down in an ambush attack. “Baton Rouge has been through a lot of turmoil in the last year,” Jonathan Dunnam, the interim police chief, said at the briefing. “Had there not been a swift conclusion to this case, I feel confident this killer would’ve probably killed again. He could’ve potentially created a tear in the fabric that holds this community together.” Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome (D) commended law enforcement officers for their work in the case. “While the motive is still unclear, this person is off of our streets,” she said at the briefing. [Fatal stabbing in New York was ‘practice’ for more attacks on black men, police say] Officials cited a combination of evidence, help from members of the public, police work and technology in disclosing how they came to identify, arrest and charge Gleason. Moore said they were able to link Gleason to the shootings early Tuesday when DNA found on the shell casings matched his own. Moore said Gleason bought a 9mm gun in Baton Rouge on Nov. 9. In July, Gleason bought a silencer that “thankfully” had not come yet, Moore said. The following month, Gleason completed a class to obtain a concealed-carry permit, although he did not get the permit yet either, Moore said. Tuesday marked the third time in recent days that Gleason was booked into the prison, according to the sheriff’s office. He was booked on Saturday for purported drug possession and released on a 3,500 bond, prison records show. Moore said Gleason was arrested again Monday for allegedly stealing a copy of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” the Douglas Adams sci-fi book. That reported book theft factored into the timeline Moore offered Tuesday. The days when the shots were fired at the residence and Cofield was killed, police received reports about a white man with a red car spotted carrying a gun, Moore said. In one case, the man was seen putting the gun in bushes, but no gun was found, Moore said; in the other, the man was seen appearing to take off his license plate and putting a gun in the trunk. On Tuesday, Sept. 12, the day Cofield was killed, “witnesses describe [seeing] a red car and a white male wearing tactical gear,” Moore said. [Southern Poverty Law Center says American hate groups are on the rise] The “Hitchhiker’s Guide” theft was reported the following day at a Books-a-Million in a mall in Baton Rouge. The report, given to police, described the potential suspect: a white man in a red car. The next day, Smart was killed with 10 rounds fired from a 9mm gun, Moore said. Video was captured, but it was not helpful, Moore said. Two witnesses describe seeing something: a white man and a red car. “Things are now starting to come together,” Moore said. By Friday, shell casings picked up at the shooting scenes appeared to be the same caliber: 9mm. Moore said more common factors were seen potentially linking the fatal shootings. “We have two African Americans that are killed, seem to be killed in the same matter, that is a red car that’s driving by, [someone] shoots from the car, then eventually after that person is taken down to the ground, then gets out of the car and apparently over the victim, if the victim is injured or dead, and continues to fire,” Moore said. Investigators began searching for the red car, looking at footage appearing to show the vehicle as well as a white man taking a license plate off it. Moore said an officer working extra duty found the car on Saturday. Search warrants were issued that day, while Gleason was booked on the drug charges and interviewed. He was released Sunday on bond and then rearrested Monday in the book theft, Moore said. Early Tuesday, the DNA was found to be a match, Moore said, and Gleason was arrested again.

Gleason is charged with two counts of first degree murder and other charges, for three... (Associated Press) BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A 23-year-old white man arrested Tuesday was accused of killing two black men and firing on a black family in a string of attacks that police say may have been racially motivated. A law enforcement official said they had found a copy of an Adolf Hitler speech at the home of Kenneth James Gleason, and investigators said DNA on shell casings and other evidence link him to the crimes. Gleason was led away from the police department in handcuffs just before authorities there held a news conference to announce that he would be charged with first-degree murder in the shooting deaths last week of a homeless man and a dishwasher who was walking to work. \\"I feel confident that this killer would have killed again,\\" interim Police Chief Jonny Dunnam said. Gleason's attorney, J. Christopher Alexander, said his client \\"vehemently denies guilt, and we look forward to complete vindication.\\" Alexander declined to say anything else. Authorities found a copy of the Hitler speech during a search of Gleason's home over the weekend, according to the law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Asked whether police suspect race was a motive for the shootings, Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said: \\"We're not completely closed off to that. We're looking at all possibilities at this time, so we're not going to just pinpoint that.\\" District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office could seek the death penalty. \\"It appears to be cold, calculated, planned (against) people who were unarmed and defenseless,\\" he said. \\"We don't need to prove motive. There are a lot of things that are unanswered.\\" No one was injured when Gleason fired multiple times into the home of a black family in his neighborhood on Sept. 11, authorities said. It's not clear if Gleason knew the family. In the other shootings, Gleason fired from his car then walked up to the victims as they were lying on the ground and fired again multiple times, police said. Neither victim had any prior relationship with Gleason. The first fatal shooting occurred Sept. 12 when 59-year-old Bruce Cofield, who was homeless, was shot to death. The second happened last Thursday night when 49-year-old Donald Smart was gunned down while walking to his job as a dishwasher at a cafe popular with Louisiana State University students. The attacks came at a time when Louisiana's capital already was in the grips of a surge in violence. The number of homicides in East Baton Rouge Parish has already surpassed last year's total of 62, The Advocate newspaper reported earlier this month. \\"Baton Rouge has been through a lot of turmoil in the last year. Has there not been a swift conclusion to this case, I feel confident that this killer probably would have killed again,\\" the police chief said. \\"He could have potentially created a tear in the fabric that holds this community together.\\" Racial tensions roiled the city in the summer of 2016 when a black man was shot to death by white police officers outside of a convenience store. About two weeks later, a black gunman targeted police in an ambush, killing three officers and wounding three others before he was shot to death. The city of about 229,000 is about 55 percent black and 40 percent white. Gleason didn't appear to have any active social media profiles. A spokesman at Louisiana State University said a student by that name attended the university from the fall of 2013 to the fall of 2014 before withdrawing. He had transferred to LSU from Baton Rouge Community College. During the search of Gleason's home, authorities also found 9 grams of marijuana and vials of human growth hormone, according to a police document. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

After numerous tries, she found it was all in vain and was very upset. \\"Maybe it's my destiny ! I'm not destined to reach the vast ocean in the legend, \\" she murmured sadly to herself. At this time, a deep voice came, saying, \\"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.\\" It was the voice of the desert. Unconvinced, the little stream replied, \\"That's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\\" \\"That's because you stick to what you are. If you're willing to give it up, and let yourself evaporate into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach your destination,\\" said the desert in its deep voice. The little stream had never heard of such a thing. \\"Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze? No! No!\\" She could not accept this idea. After all, she had never experienced anything like it before.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope? As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search.

In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band.

Context: David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2.

Title: Welcome to the Dollhouse Movie plot: Twelve-year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy, unattractive, unpopular seventh grader living in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey. Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn).

Apple discontinued the use of PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. All new Macs now use x86 processors made by Intel, and some were renamed as a result. Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an emulator called Rosetta, although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. However, the Classic environment is unavailable on the Intel architecture. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as Virtual PC. In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website. On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of Boot Camp, software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.

With an increasing number of individuals complaining of back problems, researchers have been trying to find the root causes behind these issues. A surprising link has recently been discovered between people with lower back problems and the spine shape of our closest ape relatives, the chimpanzees. This article will delve into this connection and discuss the implications of this finding. Background Our understanding of the human spine has evolved over the years, but it is well known that our spinal column is designed to carry the weight of our upper body and protect the delicate spinal cord. Humans, unlike other primates, have an S-shaped spine that helps distribute the weight of our upright posture. Recent studies have demonstrated that people with lower back problems are more likely to possess a spine shape similar to the chimpanzee, our closest ape relatives. By analyzing the spine shape and comparing it to chimpanzees, researchers have been able to establish a connection between lower back pain and this distinct spinal curvature. The Study The study involved observing and analyzing the spines of individuals with and without lower back problems. Using advanced imaging techniques and statistical analysis, researchers compared the spinal shape of these humans to the spinal structure of chimpanzees. The results indicated that individuals with lower back pain exhibited spine shapes that more closely resemble those of chimpanzees than those without pain. Possible Implications This discovery has multiple implications in the world of healthcare and medical research. Firstly, it provides a new perspective on the possible causes of lower back pain. Researchers can now focus on studying and understanding the underlying factors that may lead to the difference in spine shape and how it contributes to pain. The study also raises the question of whether spinal shape is a natural or acquired trait in some individuals. Moreover, this finding can pave the way for new treatment options. By determining the specific spinal characteristics that cause or contribute to pain, healthcare professionals may be able to develop targeted therapies or preventative measures to address these issues. For instance, physical therapy exercises or chiropractic adjustments may be tailored to correct spine curvature and alleviate lower back pain. Additionally, advancements in orthopedic technologies could lead to the development of spinal supports or devices that promote better spinal alignment for people with atypical spinal shapes. Conclusion In conclusion, the discovery of a connection between people with lower back problems and the chimpanzee-like spine shape has significant potential for improving our understanding of lower back pain. This insight can guide researchers and medical practitioners in developing targeted treatments and preventive measures to address these problems and ultimately improve the lives of individuals suffering from chronic lower back pain."},{"prompt":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

Answer:","completion":"The coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over natural resources within an area defined as the \\"exclusive economic zone\\" (EEZ) by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The EEZ extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers; 230 miles) from the baseline, which is usually the low-water line or the seaward limit of the nation's territorial waters. Within this zone, the coastal nation has exclusive rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage natural resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on and under the seabed. In addition to the exclusive economic zone, the coastal nation also has rights over the \\"continental shelf,\\" which is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. In this area, the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I have recently watched this movie twice, and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. I mean, yes, It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's, WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'. If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. 4/10","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mixed. The person who wrote the review found some things they liked about the movie, like how it showed the environment and history very well. But they also didn't like how the movie portrayed Hitler, saying it was not accurate and too focused on the bad parts. They think the movie could have been better if it showed a more balanced view. So, even though they gave it a 4 out of 10, they had both good and bad feelings about the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can we draw the following conclusion? United Nations mandate the the award recipient must serve at least 4 terms.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the United Nations mandates that a recipient of the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal (An Bonn Chosantóirí Siochána na Náisiún Aontaithe) must serve at least four terms. The only information given is that the medal is awarded to those members of the Irish Defence Forces or Chaplaincy Service who have served overseas on a United Nation Mission or United Nations Mandated Mission. Let us dive deeper to explore related criteria and context relevant to the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal and its potential requirements. The United Nations Peacekeepers Medal is a form of recognition for military personnel and other individuals who have contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has been engaged in peacekeeping missions since 1948, and these missions involve military, police, and civilian personnel from various countries who work together to prevent conflict and promote peace. The gold medal with a blue-and-white ribbon signifies the UN's colors and honors the personnel's dedication to peace and security. Before determining whether the United Nations imposes a stipulation of four terms for eligibility for the Peacekeepers Medal, we should examine how the term \\"term\\" is defined in the context of military service. A term may refer to the duration of a servicemember's enlistment or engagement in a particular role. In the context of peacekeeping missions, it could refer to the period spent serving on a particular mission. The United Nations typically defines the length of these terms by the mission and the participating personnel's role. In general, mission length varies greatly, from several months to several years, depending on the situation and requirements of each peacekeeping mission. Personnel contributions to these missions may also be based on rotations, wherein a peacekeeper is present for a specific period, leaves, and gets replaced by another individual from the same or another contributing country. Considering this information, it is essential to keep in mind that the number of terms a peacekeeper serves depends on numerous factors and may not directly correlate with eligibility for the Peacekeepers Medal. Now, when it comes to the eligibility criteria for awarding the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal, it is crucial to know that the United Nations leaves the decision-making to the contributing countries. In this case, the Irish government is responsible for determining eligibility criteria for the recipients of An Bonn Chosantóirí Siochána na Náisiún Aontaithe. In conclusion, without additional information on specific eligibility criteria set by the Irish government for the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal, we cannot firmly assert that the United Nations mandates a recipient to serve at least four terms. However, it is important to note that the requirements for such an award would typically be determined by the contributing country, in this case, Ireland, and would probably take into consideration factors related to the servicemember's duration and contributions to the mission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This area, which stretches millions of kilometers beyond the orbit of Mars, contains objects and phenomena that could dramatically alter our understanding of the universe. Here, past the orbit of Mars, lies the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region that houses countless rocky bodies. These bodies range in size from small boulders to objects nearly 1000 kilometers in diameter. It's interesting to note that despite the large number of objects in this area, the asteroid belt is actually quite sparse. If you were to stand on an asteroid in this belt, it's unlikely that you would see another one without the aid of a telescope. Beyond the asteroid belt, we enter the outer regions of the solar system. This realm, bordered by the gas giant Jupiter and extending out past the distant dwarf planet Pluto, is composed primarily of gas giants and icy bodies. The four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - dominate this region with their immense size and gravity. These planets are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, like the Sun, but also contain heavier elements and compounds, including water, methane, and ammonia. Further out, beyond the gas giants and past Neptune's orbit, lies the Kuiper belt, home to thousands of icy bodies, including Pluto. This area is thought to be the source of many comets that periodically grace our skies. Even further out, extending to distances nearly 200,000 astronomical units from the Sun, is the Oort cloud. This hypothetical region, proposed by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, is thought to house billions of icy objects. The furthest regions of our solar system are vast and mysterious, and their exploration will likely yield surprises and new knowledge for centuries to come. In conclusion, the space beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of the solar system, features a fascinating and diverse range of objects. From the rocky remnants of the asteroid belt to the gaseous expanse of the gas giants, and from the icy bodies of the Kuiper belt to the hypothetical Oort cloud, this region presents many intriguing opportunities for scientific discovery and exploration.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Ballantine Books is a major book publisher located in the United States, founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine. It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company). - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana: or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan. - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\". - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915 May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy . - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002. - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion. - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world. As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC. - Alice Borchardt (née Alice Allen O'Brien; October 6, 1939 July 24, 2007) was a writer of historical fiction, fantasy, horror.

But remember, this is a job for grown-ups, so make sure an adult is helping you when you try this at home! 1. Secure the pipe firmly in a vise (like a big clamp). Your grown-up helper should make sure the pipe doesn't move while working on it. It's important to hold it tight in something called a vise, which is like a big strong hand with metal fingers! 2. Put on work gloves and safety glasses. Just like superheroes wear their costumes, we need to wear special gloves and glasses to stay safe while working. The gloves will protect our hands and the glasses will keep our eyes safe. 3. Cut and clean the pipe. Now, it's time to cut the pipe using a special tool. After cutting it, your grown-up helper will smooth the rough edges with another special tool called a reamer. This makes the end of the pipe nice and smooth! 4. Choose a die head based on the pipe's diameter. A die head is like a magical tool that creates threads on the pipe so other parts can attach to it. Your helper will pick the right size die head to match the size of your pipe. 5. Attach the die head to a ratcheting pipe threader handle. Now your grown-up helper will connect the die head to its best friend, called the ratcheting pipe threader handle. They work together to make the magic threads on the pipe! 6. Lubricate the end of the pipe with threading oil. Time for some spa treatment! Your helper will put some special oil on the end of the pipe. This makes it easier for the die head to do its magic and create the threads. 7. Place the die head onto the end of the pipe. Your grown-up helper will now place the die head (with its attached handle) onto the greased-up end of the pipe. 8. Ratchet the handle while applying pressure to the die head to start cutting. Finally, your helper will move the ratcheting pipe threader handle back and forth. This helps the die head to move around the pipe, cutting those magical threads that we need! And that's it! Now you and your grown-up helper know how to cut and thread a pipe, and you can help others learn about it too. Remember to always stay safe and ask for help when working with tools.

Given the following context: By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, he produced the single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \\"my friend ... my master\\" and \\"a perfect example of everything he preached\\".

Karachis population had grown at a rate of 3.49% between the 1981 and 1998 census, leading many analysts to estimate Karachis 2017 population to be approximately 18 million by extrapolating a continued annual growth rate of 3.49%.

Rabbit travel cages should be rigid, non-collapsible, well-ventilated, and secure to ensure that the rabbit cannot chew through or escape them. Your cage should also have a top opening option to allow nervous rabbits to be removed easily.","completion":"Apart from the proper selection of a rabbit carrier, there are multiple factors to consider when planning to transport a rabbit: 1. Preparing the cage: Before placing your rabbit in the travel cage, line it with a soft, absorbent material like newspapers or towels, which will provide comfort and protection from bumps and shocks during transportation. Additionally, you may also want to include a hide or small box for your rabbit to hide in, as this can help them feel secure and reduce stress. 2. Food and water supply: It is essential to provide your rabbit with water and food during transportation, especially if the journey is long. Attach a sturdy water bottle and fill it with fresh water, and include their regular pellets or hay in the cage. However, avoid giving your rabbit vegetables or fruits, as these could lead to an upset stomach during travel. 3. Environment considerations: Rabbits are sensitive creatures, and their travel environment should be as comfortable as possible. Keep the carrier away from direct sunlight, harsh winds, extreme cold or heat, and excessive noise. Maintaining a calm, quiet, and temperature-controlled environment for your rabbit will reduce their stress during transportation. 4. Acclimating to the carrier: Before the trip, allow your rabbit to familiarize themselves with the carrier by placing it in their living space for a few days. This helps the rabbit associate the carrier with a safe and comfortable place, making it easier for them to enter the carrier when the time comes to transport them. 5. Handling and lifting: When moving your rabbit in and out of the carrier, handle them gently to avoid causing injury or stress. Support their body entirely, especially their spine and hind legs. 6. Monitoring your rabbit: During transportation, keep an eye on your rabbit to ensure they are not overly stressed, agitated, or displaying any signs of discomfort. If they appear nervous or frightened, avoid sudden movements or loud noises that could further increase their anxiety. 7. Safe transportation mode: When transporting your rabbit, whether in a car or on public transportation, ensure that the carrier is placed securely and steadily on the floor or seat, with minimal chances of tipping or falling over. This prevents unnecessary distress or harm to your rabbit. 8. Arriving at the destination: Upon arrival at your destination, allow your rabbit time to adjust to their new environment. Give them a quiet place to rest and make sure their living space is safe and comfortable before introducing them to their new surroundings. Ensuring your rabbit's safety and comfort while transporting them is an essential aspect of responsible pet care. It requires planning, preparation, and attention to detail to guarantee a safe and stress-free journey. By following the steps provided above, you can ensure that your rabbit is transported safely and comfortably, no matter the distance traveled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His father was Max Ziser (1874-1946) and his mother was Ida (nee Raphael) (1887-1975). They likely were from Dabrowa Tarnowska, Poland. Reports state that the surname \\"Caesar\\" was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at Ellis Island. Caesar's television career began with an appearance on Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater in the fall of 1948. In early 1949, Caesar and Liebman met with Pat Weaver, vice president of television at NBC, which led to Caesar's first series, Admiral Broadway Revue with Imogene Coca. The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on NBC and the DuMont network, and was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, Admiral, an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was cancelled after 26 weeks--ironically, on account of its runaway success. On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of Your Show of Shows, initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950-51 season, Your Show of Shows became its own, 90-minute program from the Interntional Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street. Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the show's sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in Motion Picture Daily's TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954. A few months later, Caesar returned with Caesar's Hour, a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, Bea Arthur and other members of his former crew. Nanette Fabray replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesar's hands, originating from the Century Theater and the weekly budget doubled to 125,000. The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured Gina Lollobrigida. Everything was performed live, including the commercials. Caesar's Hour was followed by ABC's short-lived Sid Caesar Invites You from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers. In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in the movies. Several As Caesar Sees It specials evolved into the 1963-64 Sid Caesar Show (which alternated with Edie Adams in Here's Edie). He starred with Virginia Martin in the Broadway musical Little Me, with book by Simon, choreography by Bob Fosse, and music by Cy Coleman. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.

You also have a big pile of 96 pebbles next to these cups. Now, if you gave away both the cups and the pile of 96 pebbles, someone would end up with -34 pebbles. We want to find out what number \\"w\\" is in each cup. First, we need to remove these 96 pebbles from the problem, so that we're only left with the cups filled with \\"w\\". To do that, we'll take away 96 pebbles from both sides of the equation. The equation now looks like this: 26*w = -34 - 96 Now if we do the subtraction, we get: 26*w = -130 We still have 26 cups filled with \\"w\\" which is equal to -130 pebbles. But we only want to know what \\"w\\" is in 1 cup. To find out, we need to share the -130 pebbles equally among the 26 cups. In other words, we need to divide -130 pebbles by 26 cups.

Process: - Water comes through a filter - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less liver working occurs happens, how will it affect HELPING the water purifier to work better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests considering the possible effects of a scenario where less liver function occurs. To thoroughly examine the potential effects of this situation on the water purification process, we need to analyze the possible direct and indirect connections between liver function and water purification. Direct Connection: There appears to be no direct connection between liver function and the working of a water purifier. A water purifier's primary functions, such as filtering out contaminants and allowing clean water to pass through, are independent of an individual's liver health. As a mechanical device, the water purifier relies on filter membranes, activated carbon, and other physical mechanisms to achieve water purification, rather than involving any biological processes associated with liver function. Indirect Connection: There are, however, some indirect connections that we can consider between liver function and the water purification process. The liver is responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and other vital functions. In a situation where liver function is reduced, an individual would be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of pollutants and contaminants found in unfiltered water or inadequately filtered water. This vulnerability could potentiate the need for an efficient water purification system as a protective measure. In line with this, a water purifier's role in removing harmful substances like chlorine, heavy metals, and chemicals is crucial in protecting an individual with compromised liver function from additional toxin exposure. Consequently, the demand for efficient and effective water purifiers may increase in this case, highlighting the importance of water purification technology in maintaining good health, particularly for individuals who are more susceptible to the negative effects of water contaminants. In conclusion, while there is no direct impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the water purification process itself, the indirect connection highlights the significance of the water purifier's role in protecting those with reduced liver function from additional exposure to toxins and maintaining overall well-being. This emphasizes the importance of water purification technology in ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water, which is essential for everyone, regardless of their liver health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the sentiment: Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is \\"Presented in Shaw Scope\\", just like the good old days. This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era. Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times. Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way. Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Do yourself a favor and go just about anywhere else for sushi. Without exception, none of the fish tasted fresh and the miso soup, cucumber salad and spider roll were all lacking flavor. Even the celery and veggies in the roll were limp! When we expressed our concern to our wait person he indicated that it was all fresh as they get it fresh EVERY TWO WEEKS. Yikes!

Analyze the tone of the review: The tone of the review is quite negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with the quality of the food at the sushi restaurant. The use of all-caps and exclamation points in some parts of the review (e.g., \\"Yikes!\\" and \\"EVERY TWO WEEKS\\") suggests, even more, the reviewer's disapproval. 2. Look for specific criticism or praise: The reviewer lists multiple aspects of the dining experience they did not enjoy, demonstrating a variety of reasons for their negativity. They mention the lack of freshness of the fish, the miso soup, the cucumber salad, and the spider roll being flavorless, and the limp vegetables within the roll. 3. Consider the reviewer's overall experience: The fact that the reviewer is a local and calls attention to potential biases in other reviews on Yelp indicates they may have a more discerning taste for sushi and a higher standard for sushi restaurants in their area. Their dissatisfaction with the manager's availability supports the idea that the reviewer had a largely negative experience. 4. Determine the overall sentiment: The sentiment of this review can be described as highly negative, as the reviewer voices their dissatisfaction with numerous aspects of the food and the establishment itself. They end the review by stating that they will not return to the restaurant and recommend that others read Yelp reviews more carefully than they did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To become a successful poker player, it is essential to understand the hand rankings, the rules of play, and the betting process. In this article, we will break down the key elements of poker to guide you on your journey towards becoming a skilled player. Step 1: Learn the Hand Rankings Poker revolves around making the best possible hand out of the cards dealt to you. There are 10 different possible hand types, ranked from the highest value to the lowest. Familiarizing yourself with these hand rankings is the first critical step to playing poker. 1. Royal Flush 2. Straight Flush 3. Four of a Kind 4. Full House 5. Flush 6. Straight 7. Three of a Kind 8. Two Pair 9. One Pair 10. High Card The better your hand, the higher your chances of winning. Each type of hand has a specific strength, and these strengths are used to determine the winner in the event of a tie. Step 2: Agree on the Rules of Play Players should decide on the rules of play and the variant of poker that they'd like to play. There are numerous poker variations, such as Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. Each game has its unique set of rules, and agreeing on the chosen variant will set the groundwork for the game. Step 3: Deal One Card to Each Player The dealer shuffles the deck and deals one card to each player, starting with the player to their left, in a clockwise direction. This process helps determine the first round of betting. Step 4: The Player on the Dealer's Left May Place a Bet The first player to act is the person sitting to the dealer's left. They have the option of placing a bet or passing the betting responsibility to the next player. When a bet has been made, play continues clockwise, as the betting action moves to the next player. Step 5: Deal a Second Card and Begin the Second Round of Betting Once all remaining players have \\"called,\\" or matched the highest bet, the dealer deals a second card. Players now have two cards in their hands and may place another bet, going through a similar betting process as in the initial round. Step 6: Deal a Third Card and Repeat the Betting Process The dealer now deals a third card to each player, followed by another round of betting. Players should assess the strength of their hands in relation to the visible cards on the table and available information about their opponents' hands. Step 7: Reveal All Hands Once all the rounds of betting have been completed, players reveal their hands. The winner is the person with the highest-ranking hand, according to the hand rankings outlined earlier. Step 8: The Winner Takes the Pot The player with the best hand collects the pot, which contains all bets placed during the game. Step 9: Rotate Dealers and Play Another Round Dealing responsibilities rotate to the next player on the left, and a new round commences. This process continues until players decide to stop playing. Conclusion Poker's popularity stems from its blend of strategy, skill, and the thrill of the unknown. Mastering the hand rankings, the rules of play, and the betting process allows players to maximize their potential and increase their chances of success at the table. As with any game, practice makes perfect – so grab a deck and start honing your skills to become a formidable poker player."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska, with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the Provinces and territories of Canada of British Columbia with 20,000–30,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the Contiguous United States with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Floridas most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980. That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? A:","completion":"The Facebook exec tried to justify the Ugly Memo by emphasizing their deep belief in connecting people.

The California fertility doctor who implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in the birth of eight babies, will lose his medical license on July 1, state officials said. The California Medical Board ruled that Dr. Michael Kamrava committed \\"gross negligence\\" with \\"repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers\\" into Suleman in 2008. Suleman -- known in the media as \\"Octomom\\" -- was 33 when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. Kamrava, who began treating Suleman in 1997, said Suleman demanded all 12 embryos that were available for the procedure. The doctor \\"did not think he could refuse to transfer less embryos than those to which N.S. would agree because he believe at the time that the ultimate decision should be largely driven by the patient's wishes,\\" the board wrote in the decision released Wednesday. \\"While the evidence did not establish (Kamrava) as a maverick or deviant physician, oblivious to standards of care in IVF practices, it certainly demonstrated that he did not exercise sound judgment in the transfer of 12 embryos to patient N.S. (Suleman),\\" the board wrote. His lawyer argued during a hearing last October that Kamrava has been \\"a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years,\\" but that he \\"ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients.\\" Kamrava was also found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including his treatment of a woman on her late 40s who became pregnant with quadruplets after he implanted seven embryos. Her pregnancy was \\"rocked with complications,\\" according to the medical board. Another case was a missed cancer diagnosis for a patient with an abnormal lab report. It was revealed during Kamrava's revocation hearing last October that Suleman still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children. The complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for what the fertility medical society called \\"a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards.\\" The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including \\"complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that,\\" Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board, testified. Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, \\"we still don't know,\\" Fujimoto said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. The California Medical Board has announced that Dr. Michael Kamrava, a fertility doctor, will lose his medical license as of July 1 due to \\"gross negligence\\" and \\"repeated negligent acts\\". 2. This decision is primarily based on the case of Nadya Suleman, who Kamrava implanted with an excessive number of embryos in 2008, resulting in the birth of eight babies. This act breached recommended standards of embryo implantation. 3. Suleman, a single mother also known as the \\"Octomom\\", already had six children through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava before the birth of her octuplets. 4. The Board's decision acknowledges that Kamrava is not a \\"maverick or deviant physician\\" but his judgment was flawed regarding the transfer of a large number of embryos to Suleman. 5. Kamrava was found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including causing a woman in her late 40s to become pregnant with quadruplets after implanting seven embryos and missing a cancer diagnosis. 6. Suleman has 29 frozen embryos in storage for her future use and the Board suggested that the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned for treatments. 7. Kamrava was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for a pattern of behavior violating the group's standards. The society advises on the appropriate number of embryos to implant according to the patient's age. 8. Giving birth to multiple children can lead to numerous health risks for both the mother and the babies. Despite potential health risks, Suleman's eight children – six boys and two girls – were all able to go home after an extended stay in hospital.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Just ten helpings of tomatoes a week could help men reduce the risk of prostate cancer by almost a fifth, according to a study. Researchers think that protection against the illness comes from a key chemical inside the fruit known as lycopene. Tomato-based pasta sauce, tomato juice and even baked beans and the tomato puree topping on pizza were all found to have a beneficial effect. Tomatoes are rich in the compound lycopene, which has previously been linked to good prostate health. And men who doubled their intake of fruit and vegetables to the recommended five portions a day reduced their risk by nearly a quarter, say scientists. In the first study of its kind, researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge and Oxford examined the diets and lifestyles of nearly 14,000 men aged 50 to 69. They found that those who ate at least ten portions of tomatoes a week were 18 per cent less likely to develop prostate cancer compared to those who had none, or very few. One portion counted as 150g of tomatoes, half a tin of baked beans, a portion of pizza with tomato puree, tomato-based pasta sauce or a glass of tomato juice. However, the researchers urged men not to overindulge in baked beans, pizza and pasta sauce as they can contain high levels of salt. Prostate cancer is the most common form of the illness in men, with 41,700 new cases and 10,700 deaths in the UK every year. Experts suspect it may be linked to the Western diet because it is far less common in countries of the developing world. Research leader Vanessa Er, of the University of Bristol, said: ‘Our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer prevention. ‘We also found men who ate more fruits and vegetables had a reduced risk of prostate cancer. The risk reduction figure for men who ate five or more portions of fruit or vegetables, compared to those who ate less than two and a half portions, was 24 per cent.’ She urged men to rely on whole foods rather than supplements and stick to a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as staying healthy and active and maintaining ‘an ideal weight’. Portions of tomatoes can also include tomato juice and baked beans, say the researchers. However, experts said there was not enough evidence for conclusive proof that tomatoes protected against prostate cancer. Dr Iain Frame, of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution. ‘It is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another, and we still don’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer. The study says men should aim for:. * 10 or more portions of tomatoes a week. * Between 750mg and 1,200mg of calcium a day. * Between 105mcg to 200mcg of selenium daily. ‘What we do know is that men shouldn’t rely too heavily on one type of food, such as tomatoes. ‘A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables together with regular exercise is by far the best option.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK said: 'Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution. 'It is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another, and we still don’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer.

A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, together with regular exercise is by far the best option. 'Increasing awareness of the key known risk factors for prostate cancer - age, black ethnicity and family history of the disease - is also crucial if we are to reduce the number of men who lose their lives to the disease every year.

A cabinet is a piece of furniture with doors, drawers, and/or shelves used to store or display items. Cabinets come in various sizes, shapes, and designs, including wall-mounted and freestanding units. The primary purpose of a cabinet is to provide organized, protected, and accessible storage for a variety of items, such as dishes, glassware, clothing, books, or tools. An enclosed shelf within a cabinet ensures that the stored items are protected from dust, dirt, and possible damage. Moreover, it helps to maintain a clean and tidy appearance in the room where the cabinet is located. Enclosed shelves can be made from various materials, such as wood, metal, or glass, and may have doors or other means of closure to keep the contents secure and discreet. B. A mortuary is a facility that handles deceased individuals' storage, preparation, and final arrangements before burial or cremation. Although a mortuary may have shelves for storing equipment and supplies, these shelves are not usually enclosed in the same way cabinets are. C. A bookstore primarily houses books for sale, displayed on open shelves or racks for easy browsing by customers. While some bookstores may have cabinets for securing valuable or rare editions, the majority of their shelves are open for quick access. D. A school building is a complex made up of various rooms, such as classrooms, offices, and other facilities. Shelving and storage within a school can be diverse, including lockers, storage rooms, and bookshelves. However, enclosed shelves are not as commonly associated with a school building as they are with cabinets. E. A bedroom is a room in which people sleep and may contain furniture like beds, dressers, and nightstands. While bedrooms often have shelves for storing books, clothing, or other items, these are not typically enclosed like a cabinet. Bedrooms may contain cabinets, but the emphasis is on other essential furniture like beds and wardrobes. Therefore, the best answer is A: cabinet, as it is the most likely of these options to have an enclosed shelf for storage and display purposes. Cabinets are versatile furniture pieces designed to provide secure and organized storage, making them perfectly suited for enclosed shelves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Question: \\"In what aspect is the coincidence of broadcast bands advantageous?\\" Context: \\"Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The coincidence of broadcast bands between COMPASS and Galileo can be advantageous primarily in terms of receiver design and interoperability. By having overlapping frequency bands, it becomes possible to create multi-constellation receivers capable of processing signals from both navigation systems. This has several benefits. 1. Improved Positioning Accuracy: By receiving and processing signals from both COMPASS and Galileo satellites, the receiver can obtain more precise and accurate positioning information. This is because the additional satellite data can help minimize the impact of errors in satellite position or measurements. 2. Greater Reliability and Availability: As the dual receiver system utilizes two separate constellation networks, it can provide more consistent positioning services. In the event of a constellation-wide issue with one system, the other system will still be operational, ensuring continuous service. 3. Enhanced Redundancy: Similarly, the overlapping frequency bands can improve redundancy in the receiver system, particularly in challenging environments like urban canyons or under heavy tree cover where signals from certain satellites might be blocked or degraded. In such situations, the availability of signals from both COMPASS and Galileo satellites can significantly improve positioning performance. 4. Cost Savings and Simplification: Developing a single receiver that can process signals from both COMPASS and Galileo can also be more cost-effective and efficient compared to creating separate receivers for each system. This integration simplifies the design and reduces the need for additional hardware components. However, the potential downside of overlapping frequency bands primarily revolves around inter-system interference, which can degrade signal quality and adversely affect positioning accuracy. To address this issue, countries are required to follow ITU policies that set priority rules for frequency usage and ensure non-interference with previous nation's broadcasts. In summary, the coincidence of broadcast bands between COMPASS and Galileo is advantageous in terms of improved receiver design, enhanced positioning accuracy, increased reliability and availability, and reduced costs. Nonetheless, it's crucial to effectively manage inter-system interference to ensure optimal performance of both navigation systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county is using a unit mesured with millimeter, Germany or United States? Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Germany. The pressure unit used in Germany, as mentioned, is the torr. The torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury\\" because a 1 torr increase in pressure causes a rise in the height of a column of mercury by 1 millimeter. Therefore, Germany is the country that uses a pressure unit measured with millimeter, not the United States. The United States commonly uses psi, or pounds per square inch, a different unit of pressure measurement. To deepen our understanding, let's explain a bit more about these pressure units. 1. Torr: This unit is widely used in the fields of vacuum physics and engineering. It was named after Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and mathematician who is credited with inventing the barometer. The unit is defined as exactly 1/760 of a standard atmosphere. Thus, 1 Torr is approximately 133.322 pascals. 2. Atmosphere (atm): This is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 pascals. It is approximately the atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level. 3. Pascal (Pa): This is the SI unit for pressure. One pascal is defined as one newton per square meter. 4. Psi: This stands for \\"pound-force per square inch.\\" It is a unit of pressure widely used in the US and measures the pressure resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch. In conclusion, each country uses different pressure units based on their convention, scientific and engineering practices. For John, it's crucial to understand these different units to better appreciate and comprehend his experiences as a world traveler. Remembering that 1 torr equals 1 mmHg can also be helpful when converting between different units of pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They were led by a man named Tavon 'Bulldog' White. They were in charge of many things that happened in the jail, even though they were not the people who were supposed to be taking care of the place. The person in charge, Bulldog, had a lot to say about what happened during his time in the jail. He told people in a big place called court that his group, the Black Guerilla Family, had made special positions in the jail. These positions let the people there be in control of what happened inside the jail. Bulldog said that even though there were guards to watch over the inmates, it was the gang, not the guards, who had the ultimate say in how things went inside the facility. This is a big surprise because it's usually police officers and guards who are supposed to be in charge of making sure everyone follows the rules.

He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam.

Answer: This territory would eventually become Mexico following recognition of the colony's independence in 1821. Question: WHAT COUNTRY IS MEXICO IN Answer:","completion":"The original question (WHAT COUNTRY IS MEXICO IN) seeks to understand the national or regional context of Mexico. Mexico itself is a country and thus, it is not within another country. The given answer provides some historical context regarding the inception of Mexico, but it does not directly answer the question. Therefore, I will provide a more comprehensive answer to the original question below. Mexico is a country located in the southern part of North America, with the United States to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south and west, Belize and Guatemala to the southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The question \\"What country is Mexico in?\\" may cause some confusion, as it implies that Mexico is a part of another country, which is not correct. Mexico is an independent nation and, in fact, the third largest country in the Americas, after the United States and Brazil. Mexico has a rich history that spans thousands of years, originating from the various indigenous civilizations that inhabited the region, such as the Mayans, Aztecs, and many others. The arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century marked the beginning of European colonization and the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which was ruled by the Spanish Empire. The territory mentioned in the given answer refers to this particular period in Mexican history. Over the years, tension grew among the colonists, and the desire for autonomy and independence manifested itself through insurrections and uprisings. The Mexican War of Independence, which began in 1810 and lasted for over a decade, ultimately led to the recognition of Mexico's independence in 1821, as mentioned in the provided answer. This event marked the birth of modern Mexico as an independent nation. In the years that followed, Mexico underwent several significant transformations, including territorial changes, political and economic shifts, and cultural developments.

How do you do this: How to pack breakable knick knacks when moving.","completion":"Step 1: Gather packing materials To pack breakable knick-knacks safely, you'll need materials that provide adequate cushioning. Collect the following items: - Sturdy moving boxes in various sizes - Bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or newspaper - Packing tape - Scissors - Permanent marker Justification: Using the right packing materials ensures that the knick-knacks are well-protected during the moving process. Step 2: Prepare the moving box Place a layer of bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or crumpled newspaper at the bottom of the box. This provides a cushioned base for the breakable items and helps absorb shocks and vibrations during transit. Justification: A cushioned base acts as a barrier against the impact of other items or when the box is placed on a hard surface. Step 3: Wrap each knick-knack individually Carefully wrap each breakable item separately in bubble wrap, ensuring that all surfaces are covered. Secure the wrap with packing tape to keep it in place. Justification: Individually wrapping each item prevents them from rubbing against each other and causing damage during transport. Step 4: Place the items in the box Put the heaviest items at the bottom of the box and lighter items on top. Make sure to place the items snugly to minimize movement inside the box. Fill any remaining empty spaces with packing peanuts, crumpled newspaper, or more bubble wrap to prevent the items from shifting during the move. Justification: Properly arranging the items and filling empty spaces minimize movement within the box and reduce the chance of damage. Step 5: Seal and label the box Once all items are packed, close the box and securely tape it shut with packing tape. Use a permanent marker to label the box with the contents and include words like \\"Fragile\\" or \\"Handle with Care\\" to alert movers that the box contains breakable items. Justification: Clearly labeling the box ensures that anyone handling it during the move will be aware of the contents and should take extra care when handling. By following these steps, you can ensure your breakable knick-knacks are safely packed and minimize the risk of damage during the moving process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,...

Question: what are chickens being prepared for? Title: City of God Movie plot: Taking place over the course of over two decades, City of God tells the story of Cidade de Deus (Portuguese for City of God), a lower class quarter west of Rio de Janeiro. The film is told from the viewpoint of a boy named Rocket (Busca pé in Portuguese) who grows up there as a fishmonger's son, and demonstrates the desperation and violence inherent in the slums. Based on a real story, the movie depicts drug abuse, violent crime, and a boy's struggle to free himself from the slums' grasp.The movie begins cinematically depicting chickens being prepared for a meal. A chicken escapes and as an armed gang chases after it bumps into Rocket who believes that the gang wants to kill him. The movie then flashes back ten years earlier, to tell the story of how he got himself into that position.Three \\"hoodlums\\", \\"The Tender Trio\\", one being Rocket's brother, Goose, are terrorizing local businesses with armed holdups. In Robin Hood fashion they split part of the loot with the citizens of City of God and are protected by them. Li'l Dice is a hanger-on who convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. Li'l Dice (\\"Dadinho\\" in Portuguese), serving as lookout, fires a warning shot, then proceeds to slaughter the inhabitants. The massacre brings on the attention of the police forcing the three to quit their criminal ways. Each meets an untimely end, except one who decides to join the church. Goose, Rocket's brother, is slain by Li'l Dice after robbing the younger boy and his friend Benny who have been hiding out and committing crimes themselves.The movie fast forwards a number of years. Li'l Dice now calls himself Li'l Zé (\\"Zé Pequeno\\" in Portuguese), and, along with his childhood friend Benny, he establishes a drug empire by eliminating all of the competition except for a drug dealer named Carrot (\\"Cenoura\\" in Portuguese).

When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a substitutional alloy. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms.

The story is based on a novel of the same name by author Michael Hornburg, published in 2001, and the film adaptation was released in 2015. Downers Grove is depicted as a typical American suburb, with a close-knit community, tree-lined streets, schools, parks, and various businesses. However, the town holds a dark secret – a supposed curse that affects the local high school. The curse dates back to the 1990s, when a series of deaths and unfortunate accidents began to occur in the run-up to graduation each year, claiming the lives of seniors at Downers Grove North High School. The town, immersed in superstition, interprets these tragic events as a manifestation of the curse, which became a local legend over time. The film adaptation mainly focuses on the experiences of Chrissie Swanson, a high school senior, as she navigates her way through the final weeks leading up to graduation. As the curse looms over the school, Chrissie and her friends begin to suspect that they could be the next victims of this terrifying tradition. Throughout the movie, various locations in Downers Grove serve as the backdrop for the story, including the characters' homes, parks, suburban streets, and the high school itself. The overall setting plays an essential role in creating a sinister atmosphere that contrasts with the idyllic suburban image. The ordinary appearance of the town helps to enhance the tension and terror that arises from the unfolding of events. The choice of Downers Grove, Illinois, as the location for both the novel and film creates an eerie, intriguing environment that plays on the viewers' and readers' fears and convictions about supernatural myths and legends that can sometimes grip small towns. By exploring the relationships between the characters and their reactions to the town's urban legend, the story delves into the psychological impact of such unexplained occurrences and connects them with the inherent fear of the unknown that is shared by many people across various cultures and communities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: The vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.:2.1 What is the answer to this question: What does DNA consist of?","completion":"DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a fundamental molecule in all living organisms that carries genetic information essential for growth, development, and reproduction. It is a complex, double-helical structure that contains vital instructions for the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of various cellular processes. DNA consists of three main components: a five-carbon sugar called 2'-deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogen-containing bases, which are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. 1. 2'-Deoxyribose: This five-carbon sugar is the backbone of the DNA molecule and plays a crucial role in the formation of the characteristic helical structure. The sugar is named 2'-deoxyribose due to the lack of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon atom compared to the ribose sugar present in RNA (ribonucleic acid). This difference not only distinguishes DNA from RNA but also adds stability to the DNA molecule, making it less susceptible to hydrolysis and cellular degradation. 2. Phosphate Group: The phosphate group, which consists of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, is another essential component of DNA. Phosphate groups serve as the connecting link between consecutive deoxyribose sugars in each strand of DNA and are important in the formation of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The phosphate groups in DNA exhibit a negative charge due to their functional groups, conferring an overall negative charge to the DNA molecule. This charge ensures the molecule's solubility in the cell's aqueous environment and facilitates its interactions with other cellular macromolecules, such as enzymes and proteins. 3. Nitrogenous Bases: Four different nitrogen-containing bases in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Each of these bases is covalently bonded to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar in their respective nucleotide. In the DNA double helix, these bases form a complementary base pairing where adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), while cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). This complementary base pairing is governed by the specific hydrogen bonding between the bases, where adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The precise pairing of these bases is crucial for maintaining the stability of the double helix, the accurate replication of DNA during cell division, and the proper transcription of genetic information to produce RNA molecules. In conclusion, DNA is a complex biomolecule that primarily consists of three components: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of the four nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine). These elements work together to create a stable double-helical structure that stores the genetic information necessary for the proper functioning and reproduction of living organisms. Moreover, the unique properties and precise organization of these components ensure the accurate transmission of genetic data from one generation to the next and their successful translation into functional proteins and cellular processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Former Manchester United keeper says he 'bleeds blue'","completion":"Title: Tim Howard Rejects MLS Return, Commits Future to Everton Everton's long-serving goalkeeper, Tim Howard, has ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new four-year deal with the Premier League club, effectively ruling out any potential return to Major League Soccer (MLS). The 35-year-old USA international has opted to continue his career in England, where he has established himself as one of the most reliable and respected custodians in the top-flight. The veteran stopper, who spent time at Manchester United earlier in his career, revealed his deep affection for the Merseyside outfit and insists that he \\"bleeds blue\\". Howard's decision to extend his stay at Goodison Park is a massive vote of confidence in the club's direction and ambitions amidst recent rumors of interest from MLS clubs. Following a successful World Cup campaign with the U.S. Men's National Team in 2014, during which he recorded a record-breaking 16 saves in a single match against Belgium, there was speculation that Howard might be tempted to return to his homeland and finish his career in the fast-growing MLS. In an official statement released by Everton, Tim Howard expressed his delight at signing the contract extension, stating, \\"I couldn't be happier to have signed a new deal at Everton. I've enjoyed the last ten years at this club enormously, and I truly believe that we have the potential to achieve even greater things in the coming seasons. I bleed blue, and to have the opportunity to continue representing this fantastic club is a huge honor for me.\\" The importance of Howard's decision to commit to Everton should not be underestimated. Over the past decade, he has been a near ever-present between the sticks for the Toffees, making over 400 appearances in all competitions. Throughout his tenure, Howard has demonstrated outstanding professionalism and consistency, regularly being ranked amongst the Premier League's top shot-stoppers. Everton manager Roberto Martinez expressed his satisfaction at securing Howard's future, emphasizing the key role that he anticipates the experienced goalkeeper will continue to play in the development of the side. Speaking in a press conference, Martinez said, \\"Tim is not only an exceptional goalkeeper, but he is also a great leader and character to have around the dressing room. His decision to sign a new deal is indicative of his unwavering commitment to Everton, and a testament to his belief in our project.\\" While some may have anticipated that, at this stage of his career, Howard might have been tempted to return to MLS and enjoy a potentially lucrative swansong in the United States, his decision to remain at Everton is a reflection of his love for the club. As a player who once claimed that he would have joined Everton for free after leaving Manchester United, Howard's loyalty to the Toffees remains unwavering. In an era where player loyalty is often blighted by the allure of money and fame, Tim Howard's decision to snub MLS and continue his journey with Everton serves as a refreshing example of dedication. Having made the bold move to join Everton a decade ago, Howard has carved out a distinguished career on Merseyside, and in doing so, has ensured his place in the club's rich history. By signing this new four-year deal, Howard will no doubt hope to add further chapters to his already impressive Everton story, while passionately continuing to bleed blue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. In 1986, Holtz left Minnesota to take over the then-struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish football program. A taskmaster and strict disciplinarian, Holtz had the names removed from the backs of the players' jerseys when he took over at Notre Dame, wanting to emphasize team effort. With the exception of select bowl games, names have not been included on Notre Dame's jerseys since. Although his 1986 squad posted an identical 5-6 mark that the 1985 edition had, five of their six losses were by a combined total of 14 points. In the season finale against the archrival USC Trojans, Notre Dame overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and pulled out a 38-37 win. In his second season, Holtz led the Fighting Irish to an appearance in the Cotton Bowl Classic, where the Irish lost to the Texas A&M Aggies, 35-10. The following year, Notre Dame won all eleven of their regular season games and defeated the third-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers, 34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl, claiming the national championship. The 1989 squad also won their first eleven games (and in the process set a school record with a 23-game winning streak) and remained in the No. 1 spot all season until losing to Miami in the season finale. A 21-6 win over Colorado in the Orange Bowl gave the Irish a second-place ranking in the final standings, as well as back-to-back 12-win seasons for the first time in school history. Holtz's 1993 Irish team ended the season with an 11-1 record and ranked second in the final AP poll. Although the Florida State Seminoles were defeated by the Irish in a battle of unbeatens during the regular season and both teams had only 1 loss at season's end (Notre Dame lost to seventeenth-ranked Boston College), FSU was then voted national champion in the final 1993 AP and Coaches Poll. Between 1988 and 1993, Holtz's teams posted an overall 64-9-1 record. He also took the Irish to bowl games for nine consecutive seasons, still a Notre Dame record. Following an investigation in 1999, the NCAA placed Notre Dame on two years probation for extra benefits provided to football players between 1993 and 1999 by Kim Dunbar, a South Bend bookkeeper involved in a 1.4 million embezzlement scheme at her employer, as well as one instance of academic fraud that occurred under Holtz's successor, Bob Davie. The NCAA found that Holtz and members of his staff learned of the violations but failed to make appropriate inquiry or to take prompt action, finding Holtz's efforts \\"inadequate.\\" On September 13, 2008 Lou Holtz was invited back to the campus where a statue of the former coach was unveiled. The ceremony took place during the weekend of the Notre Dame/Michigan game, almost twenty-two years to the day after Holtz coached his first Notre Dame team against the Wolverines. Did he make it to any bowl games while there?","completion":"Yes, Lou Holtz made it to several bowl games while coaching at Notre Dame. During his tenure from 1986 to 1996, Holtz led the Fighting Irish to nine consecutive bowl games, which remains a Notre Dame record. Some of the notable bowl games that Holtz coached the Notre Dame team in include: 1. 1987 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame played against Texas A&M Aggies and lost 35-10. 2. 1989 Fiesta Bowl - Notre Dame defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers with a score of 34-21, claiming the national championship. 3. 1990 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame won against the Colorado Buffaloes with a score of 21-6, finishing the season ranked second in the final standings. 4. 1991 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame lost to the Colorado Buffaloes with a 10-9 score. 5. 1992 Sugar Bowl - Notre Dame defeated Florida Gators with a 39-28 score. 6. 1993 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame won against Texas A&M Aggies with a score of 28-3. 7. 1994 Cotton Bowl Classic - Notre Dame once again defeated Texas A&M Aggies with a score of 24-21. 8. 1995 Fiesta Bowl - Notre Dame lost to Colorado Buffaloes with a 41-24 score. 9. 1996 Orange Bowl - Notre Dame played against Florida State Seminoles and lost 31-26. These appearances in bowl games demonstrate the success of Lou Holtz's coaching at Notre Dame, including the 1988 national championship title and several top-tier finishes in final rankings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The currency reached its highest value since January 1992, driven by market speculation that the Bank of Canada – the nation's central bank – may raise its interest-rate target in the coming month. This topic covers various aspects such as the factors contributing to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the potential consequences of the central bank increasing its interest-rate target, and potential impacts on the Canadian economy. I. Factors contributing to the Canadian dollar appreciation Several factors have contributed to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, including: 1. Increasing commodity prices: Canada is a major exporter of commodities such as oil, gas, and minerals. As global demand and economic recovery continue to strengthen, commodity prices have been on the rise, which bolsters the Canadian dollar. 2. Economic recovery and growth: The Canadian economy has shown signs of recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the vaccination rollout and easing of pandemic-related restrictions, economic growth has also been supported, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar. 3. Global market trends and USD weakness: The appreciation of the Canadian dollar can also be attributed to weakening of the US dollar against major currencies, as investors look for more profitable investment opportunities. The increased demand for the Canadian dollar due to global market trends has supported its appreciation. 4. Expectations of a central bank interest rate hike: Market speculation that the Bank of Canada may raise its interest-rate target in the near future has further contributed to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. II. Consequences of central bank increasing its interest-rate target If the Bank of Canada does decide to increase its interest-rate target, several consequences may arise, including: 1. Increased borrowing costs: Higher interest rates will lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. This could affect consumer spending, business investment, and potentially slow down economic growth. 2. Inflation management: A primary motive for central banks to raise interest rates is to manage inflation. If the Canadian economy is experiencing inflationary pressures, an increase in the interest-rate target could help to control inflation and stabilize prices. 3. Attraction of foreign investment: Higher interest rates typically make a country's financial markets more attractive to foreign investors, as they may seek better returns on their investments. This could lead to an influx of foreign capital, which would further strengthen the Canadian dollar. III. Potential impacts on the Canadian economy If the central bank does raise its interest-rate target, it could have several effects on the Canadian economy: 1. Impact on exports: A stronger Canadian dollar makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which could lead to decreased demand for Canadian goods and services. This may negatively impact export-oriented industries in the short term. 2. Impact on imports: A stronger dollar makes imports cheaper for Canadians, which could lead to increased consumption of foreign goods and services. While this may benefit consumers, it could also lead to a higher trade deficit. 3. Impact on domestic business: Higher interest rates could slow down business investments, as companies may put off expansion plans due to increased borrowing costs. A weaker overall business environment could impact employment and overall economic growth. In conclusion, the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar has been driven by various factors such as increasing commodity prices, economic recovery, global market trends, and speculations about the central bank raising its interest-rate target. If the central bank does decide to raise interest rates, this could have both positive and negative consequences on the Canadian economy. It is essential for policymakers to monitor and assess these impacts in order to ensure stability and sustainable growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This option doesn't make much sense for a man in a lab coat talking to patients. [ii] He teaches how to sharpen knives with a sharpening stone. Again, this seems unrelated to the situation with the man visiting patients. [iii] He shows how to use an electric crochet hook. It's a crafting tool, not really related to what the man in a lab coat is doing. [iv] He gives step by step instructions on how to wash hands properly.

Write an email with the following subject: Kinder/Morgan PRM Structure Email:","completion":"Subject: Kinder/Morgan PRM Structure - An Overview and Proposal for Enhancement Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. As the leader of our team focusing on the Kinder/Morgan partnership, I would like to discuss the existing Performance and Risk Management (PRM) structure and propose a few enhancements to streamline our operations and further fortify our alliance. I request your valuable insights and inputs on the proposed changes, as your experience and expertise will be pivotal in strengthening the framework. At present, our PRM structure for the Kinder/Morgan partnership comprises the following key components: 1. Performance Management: Our current performance management process involves setting annual goals, conducting quarterly reviews, and carrying out annual appraisals for project milestones and individual achievements. 2. Risk Management: We have a detailed process of risk identification, assessment, monitoring, and mitigation, incorporating financial, operational, and compliance risks. 3. Internal Controls: Our internal controls consist of various policies, procedures, and mechanisms designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the effectiveness of our business operations. 4. Reporting and Analytics: We have a data-driven reporting and analytics system in place, enabling real-time tracking and analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) to help us make informed strategic decisions. While our current PRM structure has served us well thus far, there is potential for improvement. In light of the evolving business landscape and to ensure we maintain a competitive edge, I propose the following enhancements: 1. Implementing a Continuous Performance Management Process: To facilitate an environment of constant growth and development, incorporating more frequent touchpoints (such as monthly or bi-monthly check-ins) between employees and managers can provide valuable and timely feedback. This will ensure alignment with project objectives, identify areas for improvement, and foster a culture of collaboration and accountability. 2. Strengthening Risk Management Protocols: While our current risk management process is robust, establishing a dedicated Risk Management Committee can enable more rigorous monitoring, quicker response times, and better coordination. This committee can comprise key representatives from various internal departments, including finance, legal, operations, and more. 3. Enhancing Internal Controls: Periodic internal control assessments can help us identify and address gaps in our current systems and adjust our control measures accordingly. Additionally, a regular review of our policies and procedures will help ensure they remain relevant and effective, adapting to the changing business landscape. 4. Leveraging Advanced Reporting and Analytics Tools: Investing in advanced data analytics and visualization tools can help us gain deeper insights into our performance trends and empower us to make data-driven strategic decisions more efficiently. 5. Fostering an Open Feedback Culture: Encourage open communication between team members across all levels and introduce feedback mechanisms, such as anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes, to promote a culture of continuous improvement. I believe that these suggested enhancements will contribute significantly to solidifying our PRM structure, bolstering the performance of our partnership with Kinder/Morgan, and fostering mutual success. I would appreciate your thoughts on these proposed changes and seek your guidance on the next steps for implementation. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing this further with you and collaborating on the path to an even stronger partnership.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the man that the person who fall for gardener serves? The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter.

Johan August Strindberg (; Swedish: [2strInd,baerj] ( listen); 22 January 1849 - 14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. Influenced by the history of the Paris Commune, during 1871, young Strindberg embraced the view, that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes. He was admired by many as a far-left writer. He was a socialist (or perhaps more of an anarchist, meaning a libertarian socialist, which he himself claimed on at least one occasion). Strindberg's political opinions nevertheless changed considerably within this category over the years, and he was never primarily a political writer. Nor did he often campaign for any one issue, preferring instead to scorn his enemies manifesto-style - the military, the church, the monarchy, the politicians, the stingy publishers, the incompetent reviewers, the narrow-minded, the idiots - and he was not loyal to any party or ideology. Many of his works, however, had at least some politics and sometimes an abundance of it. They often displayed that life and the prevailing system were profoundly unjust and injurious to ordinary citizens. The changing nature of his political positions shows in his changing stance on the women's rights issue. Early on, Strindberg was sympathetic to women of 19th-century Sweden, calling for women's suffrage as early as 1884. However, during other periods he had strongly misogynistic opinions, calling for lawmakers to reconsider the emancipation of these \\"half-apes ... mad ... criminal, instinctively evil animals.\\" This is controversial in contemporary assessments of Strindberg, as have his antisemitic descriptions of Jews (and, in particular, Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life) in some works (e.g., Det nya riket), particularly during the early 1880s. Strindberg's antisemitic pronouncements, just like his opinions of women, have been debated, and also seem to have varied considerably. Many of these attitudes, passions and behaviours may have been developed for literary reasons and ended as soon as he had exploited them in books. In satirizing Swedish society - in particular the upper classes, the cultural and political establishment, and his many personal and professional foes - he could be very confrontational, with scarcely concealed caricatures of political opponents. This could take the form of brutal character disparagement or mockery, and while the presentation was generally skilful, it was not necessarily subtle. His daughter Karin Strindberg married a Russian Bolshevik of partially Swedish ancestry, Vladimir Smirnov (\\"Paulsson\\"). Because of his political views, Strindberg was promoted strongly in socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union and Cuba.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he talk about his political views?","completion":"Yes, Johan August Strindberg did talk about his political views. As mentioned in the provided text, he was influenced by the history of the Paris Commune, and young Strindberg embraced the view that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes. He was admired by many as a far-left writer and identified as a socialist or perhaps more of an anarchist and libertarian socialist. However, his political opinions changed considerably over time, and he was not loyal to any particular party or ideology. Many of his works contained some level of political content, often displaying the injustices of life and the prevailing system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Adverse drug reactions are appreciably harmful or unpleasant reactions resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. Different reasons for the RPE atrophy such as collateral damage of the choriocapillaris with a subsequent secondary RPE atrophy, a direct photochemical effect due to the early localization of the photosensitizer in the RPE, or a depigmentation or photobleaching of the RPE, which led to a window defect in the fluorescein angiogram without loss of the major functional properties of the RPE, are possible mechanisms involved in the development of the documented lesion.","completion":"Task Explanation: The given task is asking you to: 1. Read and understand a medical case report extracted from MEDLINE. 2. Identify if the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. 3. Classify your findings into two categories: non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. Guidelines for the Task: 1. Carefully read through the provided medical case report. 2. Look for any instances where an intervention related to the use of medical products is causing harmful or unpleasant reactions. 3. Determine if these reactions are significant enough to predict future hazards, require prevention or specific treatment, dosage alteration, or product withdrawal. How to Use Guidelines to Find the Answer: 1. Identify keywords and phrases that suggest the presence of an adverse drug reaction in the provided case report. 2. Evaluate if the mentioned reactions meet the criteria for classifying them as adverse drug events or not. 3. Based on your evaluation, classify your findings into one of the two categories: non-adverse drug event or adverse drug event. Applying these guidelines to the case report provided, we can evaluate the presence of adverse drug reactions. In this case, there are potential reasons mentioned for RPE atrophy, but no explicit mention of a medical product causing harmful or unpleasant reactions.

This is probably the nicest hotel I've stayed at. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud. It's the best sleep I've had in a while. Flatscreen tv. Huge bathtub. Tv in the bathroom. Desk with fax and internet connection to do your work if you're here for business (but you gotta pay for that internet, around 12). And oh, DON'T touch those mini bar snacks!! Move them for more than 30 seconds and they'll charge you whether you eat them or not. A good place to stay if you plan on staying in the room for an extended period of time, but a little too costly if you're going to be out most of the time. GAMBLING: 25 cent Wheel of Fortune is my new best friend. There's nothing like spinning the wheel and winning a couple hundred dollars. Make sure you can hear other people spinning and winning though, because one time I played when people weren't and lost some money. Roulette tables change their minimum at night. The cheapest table is 10 and it goes up to 15. It's not a big bump, but it's big enough to keep me from playing more than a couple of spins. I don't know if it's a Vegas norm or a Wynn norm. And personally, I think the table was hitting 00 a little too often. 1 cent slots--fun to play, easy to win, but overall I think you win more by playing something like Wheel of Fortune. SKINNY on the WYNN PLAYER's CARD (RED CARD): FREE PLAY Upon signing up for the Red Card you get 10 free play. You do not have to be a guest to get the card. After earning (by spending/winning) 25 points you get to spin their wheel and win a prize (money in slot play, free buffets, etc). However, do not assume that 1 point equals 1 dollar as I did, because 1 point is actually 3 spent/won. Yikes! I was wondering why it was taking so long to accumulate points... SKIP THE BUFFET LINE Get the Red Card and you can skip the long regular buffet line and stand in a shorter Red Card line. FREE BUFFETS Upon signing up for the Red Card, you can earn points during your visit to win 2 free buffets. (I don't know how this works for people who are not guests of the hotel. I was there for 3 days so I had 3 days to earn my points.) To win the buffets, you do have to earn 150 points, which is a lot, but depending how big a gambler you are, you might earn it pretty quickly. And if you're an even bigger gambler and earn 500 points, you can get 2 more free buffets. Buffets can be used during a future visit. If you're with another person you can just use the same card to accumulate points faster. If you both live at the same address and can prove it (via driver's licence, etc.) you have the option of linking your cards so you can each sign up and each get the 10 free slot play, and as I understand it (double-check to be sure), your combined points can work towards the buffets. Options are: [A]. negative; [B]. positive;","completion":"[B]. positive; The review is positive as the author mentions several aspects of the hotel that they enjoyed, including the plush, expensive feel, the comfortable bed, and the amenities in the room.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Sick Girl is the story of Izzy Shea (Leslie Andrews), a girl who wants to protect her younger brother, have sex with her older brother and torture everyone else out in the barn. Izzy is raising her younger brother, Kevin, by herself. Their parents are deceased and her older brother, Rusty, is away in the Marines. When Izzy learns that her little brother is being bullied at school, she does what any unstable, psychopathic, homicidal sister would do.[3] The movie starts out with Izzy waiting for the school bus. In the back are two popular girls who make several snide remarks about her. One of the girl's boyfriend is following the bus route in his car with his friend. The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded. After Izzy attacks one of the nuns on the bus for seemingly no reason, she's kicked off and begins to walk back along the road. She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car. She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene. Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him. The scene ends, and now we see Izzy cleaning herself up in a bathroom. She is covered in blood and is completely unfazed by this. Clips are shown of Izzy finding a gun in the boys' car, and her holding the school bus hostage, seemingly killing everyone. She chases the two popular girls off the bus, and with the gun and a can of gasoline, she quickly catches one of the girls. The other watches in horror as Izzy kills her friend. Izzy returns home, and we see a flashback sequence of Rusty training Izzy how to fight in their garage. The two share a moment of sibling fondness, but it is cut short by the arrival of Rusty's girlfriend. The flashback sequence ends, and Izzy finds their family friend, Barnie, teaching Kevin how to throw a punch....

Voltage peak.","completion":"The word \\"peak\\" in both sentences conveys the general idea of reaching the highest point or the maximum value; however, its meaning is specific to the context and subject matter in which it is used. Let's look at each sentence in detail to understand the differences in their respective meanings. 1. \\"The stock market reached a peak in September 1929.\\" In this sentence, \\"peak\\" refers to the highest point or the pinnacle of the stock market. When discussing financial markets such as the stock market, the word \\"peak\\" is used to describe a point where the market reaches its highest value before starting to decline. In this context, \\"peak\\" implies that the market was at its greatest height in terms of value, investor confidence, and overall performance, possibly representing the zenith of an economic boom period. A peak in the stock market often relates to stock prices, market capitalization, trading volume, and other financial parameters that indicate the market's health. 2. \\"Voltage peak.\\" The term \\"voltage peak\\" is a technical term used in the context of electrical and electronic systems. In this context, \\"peak\\" relates to the maximum value or amplitude of an electrical waveform (a signal representing voltage over time). Voltage is a measure of the electric potential difference between two points, and it fluctuates over time in alternating current (AC) systems and some electronic circuits. A \\"voltage peak\\" is reached when the voltage reaches its maximum positive or negative value during a waveform cycle. This value is important in various applications, such as power transmission, signal processing, and analyzing the performance of electronic devices. In summary, \\"peak\\" represents the highest point or maximum value in each respective context. In the first sentence, it refers to the highest point of the stock market, capturing the idea of optimal financial performance. In the second sentence, it refers to the maximum value of voltage within an electrical waveform, which is significant for understanding and working with electrical and electronic systems.

The other man tells him that he's tired of losing all his money to him and that this is a winner take all competition. This man's name is Jan Wolfhouse. He manages to successfully flip the coin into the very narrow flower vase full of beer. The other man - Jan's father, drinks the beer down without fail. Jan's brother Todd shows up and their father is talking about how he's berating Jan in a friendly beer drinking competition. Todd informs the both of them that everyone is waiting. It's then revealed that everyone is at a funeral for the patriarch of the family - Johan Wolfhouse. Johan is in the hospital hooked up to a machine. He gives his own eulogy via a pre videotape where he gives his final wishes while downing a beer for each one of them. One was for his mother who he always knew would outlive him, the other is for his grandsons Todd and Jan, and for them to take good care of the family restaurant. The final one is to himself.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,951,269, with an estimated population of 2,114,801 in 2015. It is by far the most populous county in Nevada, accounting more than two-thirds of its residents. Las Vegas, Nevada's most populous city, has been the county seat since the county was established. Can we draw the following conclusion? The estimated population of Clark County in 2015 was higher than in the 2010 census because of immigration. Options are: - Yes. - It's impossible to say. - No.","completion":"It's impossible to say. While it is true that the estimated population of Clark County in 2015 was higher than in the 2010 census, we cannot draw the conclusion that the sole cause of this increase was immigration. Population growth occurs due to various factors, including birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. It is likely that the increase in population was caused by a combination of factors rather than just immigration. For instance, an area with a growing economy, a low cost of living, and high quality of life may attract people from other parts of the country and even the world. In the case of Clark County, the thriving tourism and entertainment industry in Las Vegas may contribute to the higher population estimates in 2015 compared to 2010. These factors may lead to an increase in the number of people migrating to the region. Additionally, a higher birth rate among existing residents can contribute to population growth in a region. If there were more births than deaths in Clark County between 2010 and 2015, it may lead to an increase in population. However, it is essential to consider that this growth could also be offset by any residents who decided to move out of the county or by a higher-than-average death rate. Overall, while immigration may be one of the factors contributing to the higher population estimate in 2015 compared to 2010, it's impossible to say that it was the sole cause of the increase without analyzing other contributing factors. Further demographic analysis would need to be conducted to isolate and quantify the specific causes of population growth in Clark County."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees fahrenheit (about 13 degrees celsius).","completion":"After choosing a warm location for your plumeria plant, the next steps involve planting, caring for, and maintaining your plumeria to ensure healthy growth and beautiful blooms. 1. Obtain a plumeria cutting or plant: Plumerias can be propagated from cuttings or purchased as small plants from a nursery. Mature plumeria plants can grow quite large, so if you're starting with a cutting, choose one that's at least 12-18 inches long and has healthy leaves. If purchasing a small plant, make sure it appears healthy and is free of any pests or diseases. 2. Prepare your planting site: Choose a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Plumerias thrive in well-draining soil, so consider amending your soil with perlite or coarse sand if necessary. This will help prevent root rot and encourage healthy growth. 3. Plant your plumeria: If starting from a cutting, remove the bottom leaves and let the cutting dry for a few days before planting. This helps to seal the cut end and reduces the chance of rotting. When ready to plant, place the cutting in a pre-dug hole, leaving about one-third of the cutting exposed above ground. Fill the hole with soil, making sure it's well-packed to provide stability. If planting a small plumeria plant from a pot, gently remove it from the container and place it in a hole that's about twice the size of the root ball. Fill in the hole with soil, making sure to maintain the same level of soil around the stem as in the pot. 4. Watering: Plumeria plants do not require constant watering. Water your plumeria deeply upon planting, and then allow the soil to dry out between waterings. This is crucial to prevent root rot and support healthy growth. During the growing season, water your plumeria every 7-10 days, less frequently if there's ample rainfall. 5. Fertilizing: To encourage growth and flowering, fertilize your plumeria every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, typically from early spring to early fall. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or a specially formulated plumeria fertilizer according to package instructions. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this may contribute to excess foliage growth at the expense of flower production. 6. Pruning: Plumerias don't require extensive pruning, but it's essential to maintain their shape and encourage branching. Prune your plumeria in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and cut back any spindly or overcrowded growth to promote better airflow and light penetration. When pruning, make clean cuts at a 45-degree angle, just above a leaf node or stem junction. 7. Pest and disease control: Monitor your plumeria regularly for signs of pests or diseases. Common pests include spider mites, mealybugs, and whiteflies, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Plumerias may also be susceptible to fungal infections, particularly in areas with high humidity. Ensure proper air circulation and avoid overhead watering to reduce the risk of infection. Apply a fungicide if necessary. 8. Winter care: If you live in an area where temperatures drop below 55 degrees fahrenheit (about 13 degrees celsius), you'll have to protect your plumeria in winter. For potted plants, simply bring them indoors and place them in a sunny spot. For in-ground plants, consider constructing a temporary greenhouse or using frost protection cloths to cover your plumeria when temperatures drop. Remember to reduce watering during the winter months, as plumerias enter dormancy and require less water. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to enjoying a thriving plumeria plant with gorgeous, fragrant blooms. With proper care and attention, your plumeria will reward you with an abundance of colorful flowers for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They both ask about how low frequency oscillations can affect power transfer in transmission lines. Now, imagine we have a long string, like a jump rope tied between two trees. When we shake one end of the string slowly, large waves will travel from one end to the other. The slow, big waves are like low frequency oscillations in a transmission line. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to our homes. But when the oscillations or waves on these lines are at low frequencies, it can cause some issues with power transfer. Just like how the big waves on our string moves back and forth slowly, low frequency oscillations take a longer time to travel over the transmission line. When the power transfer is slow, it's harder for electricity to reach our homes quickly and efficiently. This means that the maximum amount of power the transmission line can deliver safely might be reduced. It's like when we don't get the jump rope to swing as fast as we want because we're moving it too slowly. So, oscillations at low frequency can limit power transfer in transmission lines by slowing things down, making it harder to deliver electricity efficiently to where it needs to go."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers. Amitabh was at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image yet again. Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties. But then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent. To me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe caper in the party, the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody, finicky character (Remember him asking Ranjeet to \\"Shaaadaaaap\\" after the poisoned cake incident\\"). His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was his loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind...and so Shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie. It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol, the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. So what is it that makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot.

Summarize: If your cat is missing for more than a few hours, talk to your neighbors and make fliers to put under door handles. Put your name, phone number, and a photo of your cat on the flier. Describe any distinguishing marks (such as, \\"triangular white spot on shoulder\\"), and write the coat color if you're distributing black-and-white flyers. Search for online templates for \\"Lost Cat posters\\" if you're not sure how to make one from scratch. Include relevant information about specific dietary or medical conditions if life threatening. Ask neighbors to kindly check their sheds, garages and basements. Closest neighbors that the cat is reasonably familiar with are good places to check with first. Offering a reward can be good motivation and can get people out looking instead of \\"keeping an eye out.\\" If you receive a report of a cat sighting that doesn't quite match your cat's description, visit the location anyway to make sure. Descriptions from strangers often don't match the description you would give the cat. Keep info on posters large, easy to read and simple. Include the relevant facts only. As well, ensure that the associated contact details are up-to-date, so a vet or animal agency can call you. Implanting a microchip is a very common procedure and only needs to be done once in a pet's life. Microchips are implanted by a veterinary professional under the skin over the shoulder blades of the cat. The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and carries a unique code that can be read by a scanner when the hand held scanning device is waved over the pet's body. When the chip is implanted in the pet, the owner provides registration information to the microchip company that will be kept on file until the owner changes that information. The code will be linked to the owner's information through the microchip's database. When the scanner reveals the code, the microchip company can then be contacted with the code and the owner's information will be available. Most veterinarians and animal shelters will check for a microchip for no charge when a stray cat is brought in. It's best to post as many fliers as you can within a one mile radius of your home. Beyond that, there are several strategies for using your fliers effectively, and places that may be worth walking a longer distance to cover: Give fliers to veterinary offices, in case someone takes your cat there to treat injuries or begin an adoption process. Post flyers near schools and playgrounds, at children's eye level. Children are often more observant than adults, especially at noticing animals. Dog runs, dog parks, pet supply stores, and pet grooming salons are all visited by pet-friendly people who are more likely to search actively. Post on community message boards at laundromats, churches, missing pet websites, schools, pet stores, libraries, and grocery stores, or any other businesses that allows it in your neighborhood. Many people who come across missing pets search for owners online. Think about posting a picture of your pet or searching for it on one of numerous pet recovery websites, local community sites, the local Craigslist lost pet section, and anywhere else you can think of. Include up to date contact information on all posts. Lost pet tracking websites include Missing Pet, Pets911, and TabbyTracker. FindToto for US residents costs money to use, but will broadcast a \\"Pet Amber Alert\\" to neighbors in your area. Twitter and Facebook can be used to spread the word among your network of friends. Be sure to include a photo or two. If your neighborhood association has an email news digest or web site, post a Lost Cat notice. Remember to include the cat's name, description and temperament. Pay a local newspaper to place a lost cat ad, including a description and your phone number. The more local to the area the newspaper is, the better. If no local newspaper serves your area, ask about community newsletters at a community center, a police or sheriff's station, or a local government building. Record a new voice mail message to make sure callers leave all relevant information. For example, say \\"You've reached (name). If you're calling about my lost cat, (name), please leave a message with the date and place you last saw him, along with your name and phone number. Thank you.\\" Usually if someone comes across a lost cat, they'll report it to the SPCA, Animal Control or your local equivalent. Call your local animal shelter and report your cat has gone missing along with all the relevant details (sex of the cat, color, and your contact information). Visit them every day or two until your cat is found, as sometimes shelters have many cats and have a difficult time matching your description to what they have. Some shelters keep a log of lost pet announcements so that they have records of your information should a similar animal come into their facility. It never hurts to make friends with the front staff at the shelter to make them personally aware of your situation and your pet's description. Home baked goods break a lot of ice anywhere you ask for help. Check in person every couple of days. If your cat has been taken to a crowded shelter or local pound, they may only be able to hold cats for a few days before euthanizing the cat. If the staff know you're actively looking, they can be a great ally. Ask them to call you if a cat fitting your cat's description turns up. Sometimes, police get calls about found animals, especially in areas without shelters. Officers who spend their day driving around might notice your cat. Do not call the emergency number for your police department! Call the non-emergency 311 number or just talk to your local patrolman instead. While your lost cat is an emergency to you, police need to prioritize incidents involving people. Check local newspapers and popular online sites daily under the \\"found\\" section. Many animal shelters have websites that show pictures of captured, stray animals, so check the website daily or more frequently. Search for \\"lost pets\\" + the name of your region to discover additional local websites. ” Pet detectives are available in most states trained in finding lost pets.","completion":"When a cat goes missing for more than a few hours, it is essential to take immediate action to increase the chances of finding the pet. Start by talking to neighbors and distributing fliers with the cat's photo, your name, phone number, and any distinguishing marks to help people identify your cat easily. Keep the flier simple and ensure the contact details are up-to-date. Use online templates for creating lost cat posters if unsure how to design one. Include any life-threatening dietary or medical conditions the cat might have, and ask neighbors to check their sheds, garages, and basements. Prioritize familiar closest neighbors, and consider offering a reward to motivate people. Don't ignore any cat sighting reports, even if they don't entirely match your cat's description, as strangers may not provide the same description you would. Place fliers within a one-mile radius of your home, focusing on veterinary offices, schools, playgrounds, pet supply stores, dog parks, pet grooming salons, and other pet-friendly locations. Posting on community message boards and online platforms such as local Craigslist lost pet sections, Missing Pets, Pets911, TabbyTracker, and social media can help extend the search. Ensure all online posts include up-to-date contact information. Contact your local animal shelter and report the missing cat. Visit regularly to check and maintain good relations with the shelter staff to increase the chances of finding your cat. Also, notify the police using the non-emergency number, as officers might notice your cat while on duty. Check local newspapers and shelter websites daily for any \\"found\\" posts, and search for \\"lost pets\\" using your region's name to discover additional websites.

Movie title: The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior Movie plot: Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes (Ari), tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers. The group reach Akkad, where Sargon turns on a machine that dumps oil into the water supply. The oil and water begin to flow through statues into the city, which is then set on fire. Using the Sword of Damocles, Mathayus fights through to Sargon but finds his own father, who turns out to be Sargon in disguise. Sargon uses the confusion to disarm Mathayus and they begin fighting. Ari picks up the sword then hands it to Sargon, revealing that he had been bribing Ari with riches. More chaos and fighting ensues in the city and we learn that the sword that Ari gave Sargon was a fake and easily shattered. Ari bursts in and gives Mathayus the real...","completion":"Sword of Damocles, enabling him to overcome Sargon's dark magic protection and strike a decisive blow. With the tyrannical king defeated, the flames consuming the city begin to die down, revealing extensive damage but also offering a chance for Akkad to rebuild and restore its former glory. Throughout the film, \\"set to fire\\" could refer to the climactic scene where Sargon sets the city of Akkad on fire by releasing oil into the water supply, causing widespread destruction and chaos. This act serves as a symbol of Sargon's ruthless and merciless reign, as well as setting up the movie's final confrontation between Mathayus and the powerful king. As for the worthiness of investing in this film proposal, there are several factors you may want to consider: 1. Genre and target audience - The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior falls under the action-adventure and fantasy genres. If these genres appeal to a large audience demographic you are targeting, there may be potential for a successful investment. Additionally, consider if the film can generate revenue from merchandising, licensing, and other sources outside of the box office. 2. Cast and crew - The success of a film often depends on the talents and abilities of its cast and crew. Research the film's proposed director, actors, scriptwriters, and producers to determine if they have a record of success in similar projects. Working with established talents could increase the film's credibility and draw a larger audience. 3. Budget and expected revenue - Analyze the film's proposed budget and compare it to similar movies that have been released recently. Consider if the investment is feasible and if the film can realistically recoup its costs and generate profits. Make sure to take into account both domestic and international box office revenues, as well as potential revenue streams from streaming platforms, home video sales, and syndication rights. 4. Competition - Keep an eye on the film industry's upcoming releases to understand the competitive landscape. Make sure that The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior can stand out and perform well against other offerings, especially those in the same genre or featuring similar storylines. 5. Reviews and marketing - Consider the importance of critical reception and marketing efforts in the film's potential success. A well-reviewed and marketed film often has a better chance of connecting with audiences, generating higher ticket sales, and securing a positive return on investment. By analyzing these factors and conducting thorough market research, you can make an informed decision on whether investing in The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is a worthwhile endeavor. Keep in mind that, like any investment, there are inherent risks in the film industry, and there is no guarantee of success. However, making data-driven decisions and understanding the intricate aspects of the movie business can help mitigate these risks and guide you towards a profitable investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland? A:","completion":"The last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale and was pivotal in disseminating the international style in Scotland is Bruce.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to Prepare for a Wedding","completion":"When preparing for a wedding, it is essential to carefully consider and evaluate the options, resources, and personal preferences to determine the best course of action. I will outline two possible solutions, and from there, you can determine which approach suits your needs. Solution 1: Hiring a Professional Wedding Planner A professional wedding planner can offer a comprehensive range of services to oversee and manage every aspect of your special day. The benefits of hiring a wedding planner include: 1. Experience: Planners have extensive experience and expertise in organizing weddings of various sizes and styles, ensuring a well-organized and enjoyable event. 2. Time-saving: Planning a wedding can be time-consuming. Wedding planners will manage timelines, coordinate with vendors, and handle all the details, freeing up time for the couple to relax and enjoy their engagement period. 3. Vendor relationships: Wedding planners have established relationships with reputable vendors, allowing them to negotiate better deals and ensuring a high standard of service. 4. Budget management: A planner can help you create and maintain a budget. They also have effective cost-saving strategies while maintaining the desired vision. 5. Creative input: Wedding planners can provide ideas and suggestions to enhance the overall theme and décor. 6. Stress reduction: A wedding planner takes on the responsibility of managing logistics and troubleshooting any unforeseen issues, allowing the couple to focus on enjoying their special day. Solution 2: DIY (Do-It-Yourself) Wedding Planning A DIY approach to wedding planning can be a more cost-effective and personalized experience, incorporating your unique vision and preferences. Some benefits of DIY wedding planning include: 1. Budget control: Planning your wedding without professional assistance may provide more control over the budget, as you can directly negotiate with vendors, eliminate unnecessary expenses, and explore DIY options for decorations, invitations, and other wedding elements. 2. Customization: A DIY wedding grants you the freedom to make personal choices, down to the smallest details, resulting in a truly unique event tailored to your specific tastes. 3. Hands-on experience: Many couples find satisfaction in being involved in every aspect of their wedding, from designing invitations to selecting vendors, ultimately resulting in a deeper sense of personal investment in the event. 4. Learning experience: The process of planning a DIY wedding can be a learning experience, as you will need to research and select vendors, create timelines, and manage your budget. 5. Bonding with friends and family: Collaborating with friends and family can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories while working together towards a shared goal. In conclusion, both approaches have their merits. Hiring a professional wedding planner offers a more streamlined and stress-free experience, with the assurance of expertise and valuable vendor relationships. On the other hand, the DIY wedding planning solution allows for greater budget control, customization, and personal involvement in the process. Your choice should depend on your priorities, available time, and level of interest in managing the planning process. If you desire a stress-free, professionally managed event with minimal personal involvement, hiring a wedding planner might be the best choice for you. On the other hand, if you are excited about the idea of taking charge of every aspect and are willing to dedicate time to the planning process, a DIY approach could be the more appropriate option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman. If there are fewer sperm present in the uterus, the probability of a sperm successfully meeting and fertilizing an egg decreases. 2. The sperm implants itself into the egg. With fewer sperm present, the chance of successful implantation and fertilization decreases. 3. The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus. If fewer eggs are successfully fertilized, there will be fewer zygotes. 4. The fetus grows and develops. With fewer zygotes, there will be fewer fetuses. 5. The woman gives birth to a baby. Since there were fewer fetuses, the woman will give birth to fewer babies. 6. The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself. Fewer babies will be raised by parents due to the reduced number of successful fertilizations. 7. The person goes out into the world and finds a job. With fewer babies being born, there are fewer individuals entering the workforce. 8. The person meets other people and has a life. The smaller population due to fewer babies being born will result in fewer interactions for individuals. 9. The person gets a career and gets married. Fewer people will get careers and marry because there are fewer individuals in the population. 10. The person retires and eventually passes away. This part of the process is not affected by the number of sperm in the uterus. Overall, fewer sperm in the uterus will result in less babies being conceived and born, affecting the population size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Black parents protest charge for teen tossed from desk; c. Charged teens allowed back in school; d. Violence at school; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school. Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest...

Season the patty with salt and pepper.","completion":"Title: A Simple Guide to Perfectly Seasoned and Flattened Hamburger Patties Introduction: The hamburger is a classic comfort food enjoyed by people all across the globe. One of the most crucial elements in creating a delicious hamburger is forming the perfect patty. In this article, we'll discuss an easy-to-follow method for flattening and seasoning your hamburger meat with salt and pepper, helping you achieve a juicy, flavorful patty for your next cookout or family meal. Step 1: Selecting the Right Meat Before you even think about seasoning or flattening, it's vital to choose the best ground meat for your burgers. Opt for ground beef with an 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio for a juicier patty with a rich flavor. This balance of lean meat and fat content ensures that your burgers maintain both their moisture and taste once cooked. Step 2: Forming the Patty Overworking the meat can change its texture, so be gentle when handling it. With clean hands, scoop out the desired amount of meat and shape it into a rough ball. You can use a food scale to ensure consistent sizing, but this is not necessary. A round shape is easier to work with and provides an even surface for seasoning and flattening. Step 3: Flattening the Hamburger Meat Once you have your ball of meat, place it between two sheets of wax or parchment paper for a cleaner and less sticky process. Use a smooth, heavy object like a rolling pin or the bottom of a skillet to press down on the meat, evenly flattening it into a patty about ¾-inch thick. Another method is using a burger press, which evenly flattens the meat and makes uniformly shaped patties. Depending on your preference, adjust the thickness of your patty. For instance, thinner patties cook faster and are best for well-done burgers, while thicker patties will give you a juicier, medium-rare to medium burger. Step 4: Thumb Indentation After flattening your patty, create a shallow thumbprint indentation in the center. This simple yet essential step prevents the patty from puffing up and curling while cooking. Indenting the center allows the patty to cook evenly, which is crucial for achieving a flat, juicy, and tender burger. Step 5: Seasoning the Patty Now that your patties are formed, it's time to season them with the two essential ingredients: salt and pepper. Freshly ground black pepper provides a robust, earthy flavor, while coarse kosher salt or sea salt brings out the natural flavors of the meat. Be generous with your seasoning – evenly coat both sides of each patty, patting the salt and pepper into the meat to ensure it sticks during the cooking process. Step 6: Cooking Your Perfectly Seasoned and Flattened Patties Whether you're grilling outdoors or cooking on the stovetop, preheat your cooking surface to medium-high heat. For optimal flavor and texture, cook the patties for about 3 to 5 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness. Avoid pressing down on the patties while they cook, as this can cause them to dry out. Step 7: Assembling and Enjoying Your Burger After cooking your patties, it's time to build your burgers. Use your favorite type of bun, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cheese, sauces, and any other creative toppings of your choosing. Sit back and savor every bite of your perfectly seasoned, flattened, and juicy hamburger. Conclusion: By following this step-by-step guide, you're well on your way to mastering the art of creating mouthwatering, evenly seasoned, and flattened hamburger patties. Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to experiment with different seasonings, toppings, and cooking methods to find your ideal burger combination. Happy grilling!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Would \\"Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar (platform) or tension-leg platform.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: *No. *Yes. The answer is:","completion":"No. A more detailed answer would be: Drilling depths for underwater drilling depend on several factors such as the drilling technology, water depth, and the geology of the ocean floor. Generally, offshore drilling can reach depths of up to 3,000 meters below the seabed, while the water depth can vary from shallow waters (less than 500 meters) to deep waters (over 1,500 meters) and ultra-deep waters (beyond 3,000 meters). Drilling from a fixed-position installation, such as a floating spar (platform) or tension-leg platform, refers to the method used to establish a stable drilling operation in the ocean. These platforms minimize the movement of the drilling structure, allowing for consistent and accurate drilling operations. However, this statement does not directly address how deep underwater drilling can be conducted. Various technologies have been developed to improve deepwater drilling capabilities, including advancements in subsea well systems, dynamic positioning technology, and drilling vessels designed for deepwater environments. These advancements enable the exploration and production of oil and gas resources in deeper and more challenging environments, extending the range of operational possibilities."},{"prompt":"Craig Kusick - Craig Robert Kusick (September 30 1948 – September 27 2006) was an American first baseman and designated hitter in Major League Baseball who played nearly his entire career from 1973 to 1979 for the Minnesota Twins.His son Craig Kusick Jr. led Wisconsin–LaCrosse to the 1995 Division III football championship as a quarterback received the Melberger Award as the top Division III player and later played in the Arena Football League.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was a border at a school near Runcorn in 1820? is inside the article: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future.

Options: - feel lonely - graduate from high school - enter college - cross street - be alone Explain why a human would choose \\"feel lonely\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would most likely choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer to the question \\"What could happen to a person if no one is around him or her?\\" because it directly addresses the emotional and psychological aspects of being isolated from other people. Humans are social beings, and being in contact with others is essential for their mental and emotional wellbeing. The other options provided might be related to personal growth, education, or daily routines, but they do not directly address the core concern of the situation, which is the individual's emotional state without the presence of other people. To further explore the reasons behind choosing \\"feel lonely\\" over the other options, let's break down each option individually: - Graduate from high school: While an individual might graduate from high school during their lifetime, this event is not directly related to the absence of people around them. Graduation is a milestone achievement that usually takes place with the support of educators, family, and friends. Furthermore, it occurs at a specific moment in a person's life, whereas feeling lonely due to isolation can happen to anyone at any time. - Enter college: Similar to the high school graduation scenario, entering college is a significant life event that is not directly associated with the presence or absence of people around an individual. Although college life involves some form of independence, it doesn't necessarily stem from a situation where the person is devoid of any social interactions or human emotional attachment. - Cross street: This daily life activity may initially appear relevant due to its simplicity, yet it does not address the primary concern of the emotional response to a lack of human companionship. Additionally, crossing a street doesn't always require others to be physically present, and it doesn't lead to any significant emotional consequences tied to isolation. - Be alone: While this option might superficially seem to align with the main issue of lacking other people around, it doesn't take into consideration the emotional aspect of loneliness. Being alone can sometimes be a positive or neutral experience, depending on one's preferences or the circumstances. However, feeling lonely indicates a deeper emotional experience of isolation and the longing for human connection. In summary, a human would choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer to the question because it acknowledges the psychological and emotional impact of being without others in their life. It emphasizes the need for social connections and the repercussions of lacking such human interactions, which can lead to loneliness. The other options may be important life events or simple activities but do not directly address the emotional context of being away from others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Naval War College (NWC or NAVWARCOL) is the staff college and \\"Home of Thought\\" for the United States Navy in Newport, Rhode Island. The NWC educates and develops leaders, supports defining the future Navy and associated roles and missions, supports combat readiness, and strengthens global maritime partnerships. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - Staff colleges (also command and staff colleges and war colleges) train military officers in the administrative, staff and policy aspects of their profession. It is usual for such training to occur at several levels in a career. For example, an officer may be sent to various staff courses: as a captain they may be sent to a single service command and staff school to prepare for company command and equivalent staff posts; as a major to a single or joint service college to prepare for battalion command and equivalent staff posts; and as a colonel or brigadier to a higher staff college to prepare for brigade and division command and equivalent postings. - Henry Effingham Eccles ( born in Bayside , New York , on December 31 , 1898 - died May 14 , 1986 in Needham , Massachusetts ) was a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy and a major figure at the Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island from the late 1940s through the 1970s , as a thinker and writer on naval logistics and military theory .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks with coal miners at the Harvey Mine on April 13 in Sycamore, Pa. (Justin Merriman/Getty Images) Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are overhauling a slew of outside advisory boards that inform how their agencies assess the science underpinning federal policies, the first step in a broader effort by Republicans to change the way the federal government evaluates the scientific basis for its regulations. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt decided to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is “reviewing the charter and charge” of more than 200 advisory boards, committees and other entities both within and outside his department. EPA and Interior officials began informing current members of the move Friday, and notifications continued over the weekend. Pruitt’s move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), which advises EPA’s prime scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity, and addresses important scientific questions. All of the people being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated. EPA spokesman J.P. Freire said in an email that “no one has been fired or terminated” and that Pruitt had simply decided to bring in fresh advisers. The agency informed the outside academics on Friday that their terms would not be renewed. “We’re not going to rubber-stamp the last administration’s appointees. Instead, they should participate in the same open competitive process as the rest of the applicant pool,” Freire said. “This approach is what was always intended for the board, and we’re making a clean break with the last administration’s approach.” The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, says he is not convinced carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 should be regulated. (Reuters) [EPA website removes climate science site from public view after two decades] Separately, Zinke has postponed all outside committees as he reviews their composition and work. The review will effectively freeze the work of the Bureau of Land Management’s 38 resource advisory councils, along with other panels focused on a sweep of issues, from one assessing the threat of invasive species to the science technical advisory panel for Alaska’s North Slope. “The Secretary is committed to restoring trust in the Department’s decision-making and that begins with institutionalizing state and local input and ongoing collaboration, particularly in communities surrounding public lands,” Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said by email Monday. “As the Department concludes its review in the weeks ahead, agencies will notice future meetings to ensure that the Department continues to get the benefit of the views of local communities in all decision-making on public land management.” Greg Zimmerman, deputy director of the non-partisan advocacy group Center for Western Priorities, said in an interview that “it just doesn’t make any sense they would be canceling meetings as they do this analysis.” BLM’s regional advisory councils include officials from the energy and outdoor recreation industry as well as scientists and conservationists, Zimmerman added. “The only reasonable explanation is they don’t want to be hearing from these folks.” The moves came as a surprise to the agencies’ outside advisers, with several of them taking to Twitter to announce their suspensions. John Peter Thompson, who chairs Interior’s Invasive Species Advisory Panel, tweeted Monday that he had been notified that “all activities are suspended subject to review by Depart of Interior.” Members of EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors had been informed twice — in January, before President Barack Obama left office, and then more recently by EPA career staff members — that they would be kept on for another term, adding to their confusion. “I was kind of shocked to receive this news,” Robert Richardson, an ecological economist and an associate professor in Michigan State University’s Department of Community Sustainability, said in an interview Sunday. Richardson, who on Saturday tweeted, “Today, I was Trumped,” said that he was at the end of an initial three-year term but that members traditionally have served two such stints. “I’ve never heard of any circumstance where someone didn’t serve two consecutive terms,” he said, adding that the dismissals gave him “great concern that objective science is being marginalized in this administration.” Courtney Flint, a professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University who had served one term on the board, said in an email that she was also surprised to learn that her term would not be renewed, “particularly since I was told that such a renewal was expected.” But she added, “In the broader view, I suppose it is the prerogative of this administration to set the goals of federal agencies and to appoint members to advisory boards.” [EPA just buried its climate site for kids] Ryan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff, noted in an email that all the board members whose terms are not being renewed could reapply for their positions. “I’m not quite sure why some EPA career staff simply get angry by us opening up the process,” he said. “It seems unprofessional to me.” Yet Terry F. Yosie, who directed EPA’s Science Advisory Board from 1981 to 1988, noted in an email that the Board of Scientific Counselors does not report directly to the administrator or his office. “It’s quite extraordinary that such a body would receive this level of attention by the Administrator’s office,” he said. And Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, expressed concern and said he hoped Pruitt reconsidered his decision. “Academic scientists play a critical role in informing policy with scientific research results at every level, including the federal government,” he said. Pruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Pruitt has been meeting with academics to talk about the matter and putting thought into which areas of investigation warrant attention from the agency’s scientific advisers. The agency may consider industry scientific experts for some of the board positions as long as these appointments do not pose a conflict of interest, Freire said. Conservatives have complained for years about EPA’s approach to science, including the input it receives from outside scientific bodies. Both the Board of Scientific Counselors and the 47-member Scientific Advisory Board have come under criticism for bolstering the cause for greater federal regulation. A majority of the members of the Board of Scientific Counselors have terms expiring this fiscal year, along with the terms of 12 members of the Scientific Advisory Board. GOP lawmakers have frequently criticized the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC)—a committee within the Scientific Advisory Board—for its recommendation that the EPA impose much stricter curbs on smog-forming ozone. The seven-person panel, which is charged under the Clean Air Act to review the scientific basis of all ambient air quality standards, is legally required to have a medical doctor and a member of the National Academy of Sciences as members. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), who questions the link between human activity and climate change and has several former aides now working for Pruitt, said in an interview earlier this year that under the new administration, “they’re going to have to start dealing with science, and not rigged science.” House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) held a hearing on the issue in February, arguing that the Scientific Advisory Board should be expanded to include more non-academics. The panel, which was established in 1978, is primarily made up of academic scientists and other experts who review EPA’s research to ensure that the regulations the agency undertakes have a sound scientific basis. “The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government,” Smith said at the time. “The conflict of interest here is clear.” In a budget proposal obtained by The Washington Post last month, the panel’s operating budget is slated for an 84 percent cut — or 542,000 — for fiscal 2018. That money typically covers travel and other expenses for outside experts who attend the board’s public meetings. The document said the budget cut reflects “an anticipated lower number of peer reviews.” Joe Arvai, a member of the Scientific Advisory Board who directs the University of Michigan’s Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise, said in an email that Pruitt and his colleagues should keep in mind that the board’s membership, just like its standing and ad hoc panels, “already includes credible scientists from industry” and that its “work on agency rulemaking is open to public viewing and comment. So, if diversity of thought and transparency are the administrator’s concerns, his worries are misplaced because the SAB already has these bases covered. “So, if you ask me, his moves over the weekend — as well as the House bill to reform the SAB — are attempts to use the SAB as a political toy,” Arvai said. “By making these moves, the administrator and members of the House can pander to the president’s base by looking like they’re getting tough on all those pesky ‘liberal scientists.’ But, all else being equal, nothing fundamentally changes about how the SAB operates.” Chris Mooney contributed to this report.

Information: - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Definition: In this task you will be given a process, and a question. The process contains a sequence of steps that happen in order. The question asks about the effect of a certain event on another event. If the first event has a positive effect on the second event, answer with \\"for\\", if it has a negative effect, answer with \\"against\\". If there's no causal relationship between the two, answer with \\"none\\". Input: Process: -Ice forms inside a cloud -Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges -The cloud becomes a thundercloud -Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge -Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud -This positive energy gathers on the ground -The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Question: What is the effect of there is more clouds bump around on more or more powerful lightning.? Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the sequence of steps in the process. Usage: The process starts with ice forming inside a cloud, which leads to the formation of electrostatic charges, a thundercloud, and eventually the creation of lightning. This shows the causal relationships between the events, ultimately connecting more clouds bumping around to the likelihood of more or more powerful lightning. Part #2: Identify the events in the question and their relationship. Usage: The question asks about the effect of more clouds bumping around on the occurrence of either more or more powerful lightning. Since the electrostatic charges are caused by ice inside clouds bumping around in the process, this implies that more clouds bumping around would likely lead to a greater chance of lightning formation or more powerful lightning. Part #3: Determine if the first event has a positive, negative, or no effect on the second event. Usage: As more clouds bumping around lead to more electrostatic charges and a higher chance of lightning formation or powerful lightning, the first event (more clouds bumping around) has a positive effect on the second event (more or more powerful lightning). Therefore, the answer is \\"for\\", meaning the first event is in favor of the second event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...

Suarez, who was starting his first match since returning from an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra last October, refused to shake the French international's hand as the team's lined up before the match. Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks It was the precursor to a fractious encounter with both sets of players reportedly clashing in the tunnel at halftime and having to be restrained after the final whistle.

No. The answer is \\"No\\" because the given information states that Remy met Riley's neighbors, who seemed to be nice people.

To expand our understanding of the possible feelings that Remy might experience after meeting Riley's neighbors, we could consider the following options: 1. Grateful for having pleasant neighbors - If Remy finds Riley's neighbors likable and approachable, they might feel thankful for having good people living nearby. This can increase Remy and Riley's comfort and satisfaction with their living situation. 2. Relieved to have resolved any doubts or concerns about the neighbors - By meeting and getting to know them, Remy can address any potential worries, preconceived notions, or misconceptions about the neighbors. As a result, they may feel relieved or reassured. 3. Motivated to foster stronger connections within the neighborhood - After having positive interactions with the neighbors, Remy might feel encouraged to further strengthen the relationships by organizing activities or engaging in collaborative efforts within the community. 4. Curious to learn more about the neighbors - Remy might be interested in discovering more about the neighbors beyond their initial impressions, which could lead to future conversations, shared interests, and deeper connections. In conclusion, it's not valid to assume Remy would feel \\"like a bad neighbor\\" after meeting Riley's neighbors, especially given that they appeared to be nice people.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Since the recording of \\"Good Vibrations\\" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre. Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'\\" When asked if Brian was \\"still the producer of Smiley Smile\\", Carl answered, \\"Most definitely.\\" Brian acknowledged: \\"We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped... answer the following question: What is the name of the group whose vocal pitch was raised by a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer?

Summarize: External factors, such as friend groups, habits, and workplace can be part and parcel to how your reputation evolves. A toxic environment with toxic people and relationships may be the source of your problems. Take some time to consider whether or not you need to make some changes in the people and places of your life. If you have a bad reputation among friends, maybe it is time to spend time with different people. Maybe your friends are encouraging habits that make people think poorly of you. At work, toxic employment environments can create unreasonable expectations of people. A work environment which encourages an unhealthy work-life balance can make it seem that a hard working, dedicated individual is lazy. Examine your workplace culture, and think about whether or not a value clash is causing your reputation to suffer. You may want to find a new job. This can be a very difficult thing to accomplish. But when you see yourself through the eyes of others, and you don't like what you're looking at, make a change. Changing yourself is hard because we develop strong patterns and habits in life. However, by making big changes in your behavior, people will take notice. This will change how they see you, and it may cause others to re-evaluate their perceptions of you as a person. Seek professional help, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. Find a life coach or a spiritual guide to help you find ways to make internal changes. Superficial change is not the same as an authentic change. Inauthentic behavior is hard to keep consistent. When you're not being authentic, people notice. Real change is harder than pretending to be different.","completion":"External factors like friends, habits, and workplace can influence your reputation.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Problem:Plan recognition aims to look for target plans to best explain the observed actions based on plan libraries and/or domain models. Despite the success of previous approaches on plan recognition, they mostly rely on correct action observations. Recent advances in visual activity recognition have the potential of enabling applications such as automated video surveillance. Effective approaches for such problems would require the ability to recognize the plans of agents from video information. Traditional plan recognition algorithms rely on access to detailed planning domain models. One recent promising direction involves learning approximate (or shallow) domain models directly from the observed activity sequences. Such plan recognition approaches expect observed action sequences as inputs. However, visual inference results are often noisy and uncertain, typically represented as a distribution over possible actions. In this work, we develop a visual plan recognition framework that recognizes plans with an approximate domain model learned from uncertain visual data.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?
