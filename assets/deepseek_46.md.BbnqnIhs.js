Next, I analyzed each word in the set of five: 1. Pastry - Some pastries are indeed fried, such as doughnuts or beignets. 2. Cake - Certain types of cake, such as funnel cake, are fried. 3. Fritter - Fritters are a type of dish that typically involves frying battered food items, such as vegetables, fruits, or meats. 4. Blow - This word does not seem to relate to fried food in any way. It is a verb meaning to expel air (as in blowing out birthday candles) or refer to a strong wind gust. 5. Apple - Although not a fried food itself, apples can be ingredients in fried dishes, such as apple fritters.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Understanding how resources are distributed is an essential tool for highlighting and correcting distortions. Knowledge of resource distribution plays a crucial role in various aspects of economic and social life. By understanding the mechanisms and patterns that govern the allocation of resources, individuals, organizations, and governments can identify and address inefficiencies, inequalities, and disruptions in the distribution of these resources. In economic systems, resources are typically distributed through markets, where supply and demand determine prices, and subsequently, the allocation of goods and services. This process is not always efficient or fair, as it can be influenced by factors such as monopolies, market power imbalances, asymmetric information, and externalities. Understanding these factors allows policymakers and regulatory authorities to devise targeted interventions and policies to correct market failures and ensure more equitable resource distribution. Inequality in resource distribution is often at the root of many social and political issues. By analyzing the origins of these disparities, it is possible to design policies and strategies addressing them at their source. For instance, unequal access to education, healthcare, or job opportunities can lead to substantial gaps in income and wealth distribution. Measures aimed at promoting more equal access to resources, such as progressive taxation, inclusive community development programs, and investment in disadvantaged areas, can help balance resource distribution and foster more inclusive societies. Furthermore, understanding resource distribution is also crucial in terms of sustainable development and environmental management. By identifying areas of excessive resource use or depletion, appropriate mitigation measures can be implemented to optimize resource allocation and promote sustainability. For example, analyzing water usage patterns can help identify regions where water scarcity is a pressing issue, and policies promoting water conservation can be introduced. In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, understanding resource distribution dynamics goes beyond national borders. Integrated economies, supply chains, and investment flows also drive resource allocation patterns on a global level. This understanding can help promote international cooperation, identify global imbalances and dependencies, coordinate efforts to address shared challenges, and encourage joint sustainable development initiatives. In summary, understanding the way resources are distributed is essential for addressing economic, social, and environmental challenges. By identifying distortions and inefficiencies in resource allocation, policies and interventions can be designed to promote more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive societies. This understanding can also foster international cooperation and effective global governance, ensuring the just distribution of resources on a broader scale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown A:","completion":"The final step of the process outlined is the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the body. Let's examine the whole process in detail to better understand how it all works together. 1. Breathing in oxygen: The process begins when a person inhales oxygen either through their nose or mouth. Air moves into the nasal cavity or oral cavity, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. 2. Oxygen transport: The oxygen-rich air then travels down the trachea, which branches into two bronchi for each lung. The bronchi continue to divide into smaller and smaller bronchioles, which finally end in tiny sacs called alveoli. 3. Gas exchange in the lungs: Alveoli are surrounded by a network of thin-walled blood capillaries. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the bloodstream, where it binds with hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells. This oxygenated blood is then carried back to the heart, which pumps it to the rest of the body. 4. Cellular respiration: Oxygen is delivered to the cells, where it plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. This process involves the conversion of glucose (a simple sugar) into usable energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. During cellular respiration, glucose breaks down in a series of complex reactions. 5. Production of carbon dioxide: The breakdown of glucose generates not only ATP but also water and carbon dioxide (CO2) as waste products. CO2 is a byproduct of the metabolic reactions that occur during the production of ATP and accumulates within the cells. 6. Expulsion of carbon dioxide: The final step in this process is the removal of CO2 from the body. CO2 diffuses out of the cells into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin or dissolves in plasma. The blood, now carrying CO2, returns to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs. In the alveoli, CO2 diffuses from the blood into the air sacs, essentially reversing the process that occurred during gas exchange. Then, the person exhales the CO2-rich air out of their body through the mouth or nose, completing the cycle and allowing for a continuous exchange of gases necessary for life. In summary, the final step of this process is the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This intricate series of events ensures that our cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production while efficiently removing waste products generated during cellular respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

The","completion":"frost on the windows was relentless, but the people inside the old cabin were content. Winter had stretched on longer than they had ever known, and supplies had dwindled down to the last few apples and some canned food. It was a tough time for the small family of four. James, the father, was a skilled carpenter who had built their rustic cabin by hand. He had grown up on tales of adventure and survival from his grandfather, and these stories had fueled his desire to move away from the city and live a life closer to nature. His wife, Emily, had been a kindergarten teacher before they settled in this remote area, and now she was responsible for homeschooling their two children, Peggy and Sam. They had planned meticulously before moving to the cabin in the woods, determined to live a more sustainable and self-sufficient lifestyle. Their chickens provided fresh eggs, and the large vegetable garden had sustained them for most of the year. They had also built a greenhouse so they could grow produce throughout the winter, but the relentless snow had crushed the fragile structure, leaving them with meager supplies to get through the season. It had been Emily's idea to save the apples for the coldest months, but sadly, their old refrigerator's freezer hadn't served them well. The apples had started to brown and rot before freezing completely, but they would not let this damper their spirits or their survival instincts. James had quickly come up with the idea of an icebox – a technique he had learned from his grandfather. The family gathered around the fireplace, taking turns reading aloud from their favorite books as they listened to the wind howling outside. The crackling fire provided warmth and comfort as they snuggled under handmade blankets Emily had crafted from old clothes and fabric scraps. They listened intently as James detailed his simple, yet ingenious plan for constructing a makeshift icebox to freeze the remainder of their apples. He explained how he would build a sturdy wooden box and layer its interior with insulation made from hay and dried leaves. They would then transport several chunks of ice from the frozen stream nearby to fill the icebox, ensuring the temperature within would drop significantly. Finally, they'd store the apples inside, and every couple of days, they'd empty the melting water and replace the ice as needed. The entire family agreed to help with each step of the process. Peggy and Sam, eager to participate, volunteered to help their dad collect ice from the stream. While the children ventured cautiously outside, clad in thick jackets and woolen hats, Emily stayed behind with James to help build the icebox. Over the course of two days, they toiled tirelessly, and the icebox finally took shape. The result was a rudimentary but effective way to freeze the remainder of their apples and extend their food supply. Though their fingers were calloused and their backs ached, they rejoiced in their accomplishment, heartened by their ability to adapt and endure. As the family gathered once more around the fireplace, with the icy wind whistling through the cracks in the walls, they passed around the now-frozen apples, feeling a sense of camaraderie that only comes from overcoming challenges. In the flickering firelight, their faces glowed with gratitude for the simple things – their loved ones, their shelter, and the apples they had all worked so hard to preserve. The long winter nights seemed less daunting as long as they had one another. As the days stretched into weeks, the family continued to work together, fixing and improving various aspects of their homestead. Their resourcefulness and resilience would carry them through the winter and beyond. The tale of their icebox would be passed down from generation to generation, a reminder that with determination, cooperation, and a strong sense of community, even the harshest of winters could be conquered. And now, whenever they would look up at the sparkling stars in the night sky, they knew that they could face any challenge together as a family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ali Mohammed Al-Nimr was arrested aged 17 after participating in anti-government protests in 2012. He was accused of protesting illegally and being in possession of firearms. Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders’ facility. Reports indicate that he was tortured and signed a confession under duress. The appeal was held in secret and dismissed, with no remaining legal routes of objection to his sentence of “death by crucifixion”, initially handed down on 27 May 2014. Maya Foa, Director of the death penalty team at legal charity Reprieve, said: “No one should have to go through the ordeal Ali has suffered – torture, forced ‘confession’, and an unfair, secret trial process, resulting in a sentence of death by ‘crucifixion’.” “But worse still, Ali was a vulnerable child when he was arrested and this ordeal began. His execution – based apparently on the authorities’ dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests – would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped.” A number of people, including minors, have been sentenced to death following their involvement in demonstrations that swept the MENA region during the Arab Spring. ||||| A prisoner in Saudi Arabia, who was sentenced to death as a child, faces \\"death by crucifixion\\" after a final appeal has been dismissed. Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested on 14 February 2012 when he was just 17, during a crackdown on anti-government protests in the Shiite province of Qatif. He was accused by the authorities of participation in illegal protests and of firearms offences, despite there being no evidence to justify the latter charge. Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders facility, where he was denied access to lawyers. Evidence indicates that he was tortured and forced to sign a document which was tantamount to a confession. The signed document formed the basis of the case against him and he was convicted of the alleged offences by the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC). However, the trials failed to meet international standards. Ali and his family have strongly denied the charges against him, but, after the final appeal - which was held in secret and without Ali's knowledge - was dismissed, there are few legal options remaining to oppose the sentence originally handed down on 27 May 2014. It is feared that Ali could be executed in a matter of days. The case against Ali appears to be based on his familial connection to Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a 53-year old critic of the Saudi regime and a prominent religious leader in the Kingdom, who is his uncle. Mr Al Nimr was sentenced to death by crucifixion on charges including 'insulting the King' and delivering religious sermons that 'disrupt national unity'. This week, it emerged that the authorities plan to execute Ali's uncle on Thursday (17 September) sparking fears that his nephew will also be killed. Human rights organization Reprieve has urged the European Union to intervene with Saudi Arabia to prevent the killings. Commenting on the inhumane and unjust sentence, Maya Foa, Director of the death penalty team at legal charity Reprieve said: \\"No one should have to go through the ordeal Ali has suffered – torture, forced 'confession,' and an unfair, secret trial process, resulting in a sentence of death by 'crucifixion.'

His execution – based apparently on the authorities' dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests – would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped.\\" Ali is just one of a number of young protestors including Dawoud Hussain al-Marhoon, who have been sentenced to death following involvement in anti-government protests. In January 2015, prominent Saudi blogger Raif Al-Badawi received the first of 1000 lashes as part of his sentence for his statements criticising the Saudi regime in 2012. In a post to the NGO's website Foa added: \\"Saudi Arabia's wave of executions since the start of this year has provoked widespread disgust. But these killings, if they are allowed to go ahead, will mark a new low.\\" Despite global condemnation, the Saudi Government has continued to carry out executions at a high rate since King Salman came to power in January 2015. On May 6th 2015, the Kingdom carried out its 79th execution of the year, and it is already close to surpassing its 2014 total of 87 executions. The Saudi government maintains all cases are tried in accordance with Sharia law, and with strict fair trial standards observed. According to Amnesty International Saudi Arabia has one of the highest execution rates in the world, with only China and Iran carrying out more judicial killings.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the Earth moving farther from the Sun can have an indirect effect on the process of the greenhouse effect. If the Earth moves farther from the Sun, it would receive less solar radiation. As a direct result, the overall temperature of the Earth would decrease. This would lead to an imbalance in the energy received and emitted by the Earth. In response to this cooling, there might be an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, as various natural processes attempt to compensate for the lower solar radiation and maintain global temperature equilibrium. This could potentially lead to a greater greenhouse effect. However, it is important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and the actual outcome would depend on various factors such as the rate at which the Earth moves away from the Sun, the specific changes in solar radiation levels, and complex feedback mechanisms within the Earth's climate system. In summary, the perturbation of the Earth moving farther from the Sun can indirectly affect the greenhouse effect by causing changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in an attempt to maintain global temperature balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are the steps I will take: Step 1: Simplify the equation if possible. Step 2: Isolate the term containing d. Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d. Step 4: Solve for d. Step 1: Simplify the equation if possible. -115*d + 8860 = 5313 - 3238 We can simplify the right side of the equation by evaluating 5313 - 3238. -115*d + 8860 = 2075 There are no further simplifications possible. Step 2: Isolate the term containing d. To isolate the term containing d, we need to move the constant term from the left side of the equation to the right side. To do this, we will subtract 8860 from both sides of the equation. -115*d + 8860 - 8860 = 2075 - 8860 Which simplifies to: -115*d = -6785 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d (-115). Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by -115 to solve for d. (-115*d) / (-115) = (-6785) / (-115) Step 4: Solve for d. When we divide -6785 by -115, we get: d = 59 So the answer is d = 59."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity. In 1972, the coffin has been purchased as part of an estate by two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles. Bobby and Billy open the coffin and become Prince Mamuwalde's first victims. At the funeral home where Bobby McCoy's body is laid, Mamuwalde spies on mourning friends Tina Williams (Vonetta McGee), her sister Michelle (Denise Nicholas), and Michelle's boyfriend, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), a pathologist for the Los Angeles Police Department. Mamuwalde believes Tina is the reincarnation of his deceased wife, Luva. On close investigation of the corpse at the funeral home, Dr. Thomas notices oddities with Bobby McCoy's death that he later concludes to be consistent with vampire folklore. Prince Mamuwalde continues to kill and transform various people he encounters, as Tina begins to fall in love with him. Thomas, his colleague Lt.

People call these strange objects Unidentified Flying Objects(UFOs). These UFOs caused a lot of interest. Some of the reports about them are difficult to believe. Some have been explained in scientific ways. Others have never been explained. Here is an account of UFOs from a report. Dennis Burdens, who wrote an article, tells us that he once saw a UFO himself. He was having dinner one night with a friend near Tripoli, Libya, and after dinner the two men walked across a yard to his room to look at some papers. Burdens noticed that the moon looked strange that night. \\"It wasn't the moon,\\" was the reply. They watched the light and saw that it was moving. It seemed to be an object rather like a big plate. In some ways it looked like smoke with a light on it, but it wasn't smoke because it didn't change its shape. It was moving in a regular way. That is to say, it didn't go suddenly faster or more slowly, and it didn't go higher or lower. So the two men decided that there must be men in it. After that, Burdens said that he felt eyes looking at him. He was being watched in the darkness. When it was nearer, they noticed that the bottom parts were brighter than the top. The bottom was yellow and the top red. Then the object suddenly turned away and left Libya, moving very fast. On a later day Burdens talked to other people about it, and he found some who had seen it. They all described it in the same way. Could they all be mistaken? Question: UFOs are _ .

We want to find what number \\"r\\" is. Here is the problem: -47r + 9275 = 17737 - 9919 1. First, let's subtract 9919 from 17737 (on the right side of the equation): 17737 - 9919 = 7818 Now we have: -47r + 9275 = 7818 2. Next, we want to get rid of the 9275 on the left side to have only \\"-47r\\" left. So, we'll subtract 9275 from both sides: -47r + 9275 - 9275 = 7818 - 9275 This simplifies to: -47r = -1457 3. Now, we have \\"-47r\\" on the left side, and we want to find what \\"r\\" is. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -47 (it's like taking away 47 frowny faces!): (-47r) / (-47) = (-1457) / (-47) This gives us: r = 31 There we go! The solution to the problem is r = 31.

If a customer is unable to maintain payments, after three months, a repo-man is sent after the customer to 'reclaim' Union property. The process of the repossession is bloody & brutal, and often results in the death of the customer.Remy is one of the Union's top repo-men, who partners with his childhood friend, Jake, to collect on past due accounts. Remy is highly regarded within The Union as their top performer, though his occupation causes problems with his wife, who sees it as unsavory. After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home, Remy decides to transfer to a sales job, much to Jake's chagrin.As his final repossession job, Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer, whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song, Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit, the defibrillator malfunctions, sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma, he is informed by Jake and Frank, his co-workers, that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart, or die. After Remy attempts to flee the hospital, he reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work, but is unable to perform his job, because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales, but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest, which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union, but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession, after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was...

Answer the following question: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes. Which ice cube will melt faster? Hint: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided and the principles of phase transitions, Ice cube B will melt faster in this experiment. When heat is added to a substance like ice, its particles gain kinetic energy and start moving more rapidly. As the motion of the particles increases, they overcome the attractive forces holding them together. When the temperature reaches the melting point, the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid. In Kendra's experiment, the burner for ice cube A is set at a low temperature, while the burner for ice cube B is set quite a bit higher. Consequently, ice cube B will receive more energy from its burner than ice cube A in the given time period, leading to a faster increase in kinetic energy and a quicker transition to the liquid phase. Therefore, ice cube B will melt faster than ice cube A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

We got there around 7:30 and the hostess offered for us to sit at the bar area for happy hour or for a 10 minute wait for the dining area. We opted for the dining area. (happy hour stops at 7..so that was never really an option?) the service was pretty slow. My husband stupidly agreed to ordering cheesesticks when the waitress offered.. I was definitely not impressed with the 9 cheesesticks. He ordered some kind of pasta dish and I ordered a salad. The portions we got for both were not very big, they tasted fine, just small. The check took forever to come. The only thing that really bothered me out of the whole night was I was looking through the drink menu when we had first sat down and the waitress suggested a mason jar drink that is apparently popular.. I can't remember the whole name something palm.. Anyways the drink came in a small square mason jar.. And it was really tasty.. But it literally couldn't have had any alcohol in it.. I mean like none.. And when we got the check the drink alone was 10! I was expecting 5-7 like a normal drink. Especially considering the small size of this one.. I've had drinks before on previous visits and usually 1 drink an I can at least tell I've drank something, but this time 1 small 10 drink that might as well have just been ginger ale. I was really not happy with the whole situation. Maybe had the drink had more alcohol I wouldn't have been so upset about the big price for such a small drink.....OPT: A). negative. B). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"A). negative. The overall sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer mentioned multiple aspects of their experience that were unsatisfactory, including the following points: 1. The hostess offered the option of happy hour seating despite the fact that it had already ended, which the reviewer found misleading. 2. The service was slow throughout the meal, with the reviewer mentioning a delay in both the delivery of food and the presentation of the check. 3. The food was underwhelming in portions and quality, with the cheesesticks being described as unimpressive and other dishes receiving lukewarm assessments. 4. The drink that the reviewer ordered, while tasty, was perceived as having little to no alcohol content, which they found disappointing, particularly considering its relatively high price. Overall, the tone of the review is discontent, and the reviewer communicates dissatisfaction with various aspects of their dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding important organs like the heart liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily. \\"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not tat, said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create \\"fat maps\\" showing where people store fat. According to the result, people who keep their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are slim. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside.Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat.Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat.They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat.Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some think it has something to do with heart disease and diabetes .They want to prove that internal fat damages the body's communication systems.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Where was the French stronghold during the battle?\\" Context: \\"By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"During the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French stronghold was positioned around the two villages of Aspern and Essling, which were strategically important as they formed the focal points of the French bridgehead across the Danube River. These villages served as essential locations for the French to maintain control over their crossing point and resist the Austrian forces. Throughout the battle, the French, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, faced a significantly larger Austrian army commanded by Archduke Charles. The French forces were engaged in a desperate struggle to protect their positions in Aspern and Essling from being overrun by the Austrians. Initially, the French managed to hold onto both villages; however, by the end of the two-day-long battle, they had lost control of Aspern, while still retaining control over Essling. The French stronghold in Essling served an important purpose, as it allowed them to withstand the ongoing Austrian artillery bombardment and maintain a bridgehead on the northern side of the Danube. However, the substantial losses inflicted on both sides, along with the continuous bombardment, forced Napoleon to reevaluate the situation and ultimately withdraw his remaining troops onto Lobau Island, which lay in the middle of the river. Even though Napoleon faced defeat during the Battle of Aspern-Essling, his stronghold's location in the villages of Aspern and Essling was of vital significance, as it enabled the French army to establish a foothold across the Danube. The fierce fighting and eventual withdrawal by the French marked a turning point, as it was the first time Napoleon had been defeated in a major battle, igniting hope throughout Europe that he could be overcome on the battlefield."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the premise, we know that the museum includes a collection of paintings from 1850 to 1950. This range falls within both the 19th century (1801-1900) and the 20th century (1901-2000). 2.

Pupils at a school which is the focus of 'Lord of the Flies' abuse claims abseiled naked while teachers watched, it has been reported. Stanbridge Earls School, which is currently embroiled in a police investigation into alleged sexual abuse of pupils, announced yesterday it will close in December and another school has been lined up to take over the site. But today it was revealed that Ofsted inspectors carrying out emergency visits to the school were told three male pupils had been naked during a school trip to the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban. Inspectors heard two female members of staff watched while the boys abseiled and allegedly took photographs of them during the May half-term trip. The incident has been reported to police by the special needs school's headteacher Maggie McMurray, the Sunday Times reported. The Department for Education confirmed the county council and police were investigating the situation at the school, where a 15-year-old girl was sexually abused by fellow pupils. A spokesman said: 'We have just received advice from Ofsted following an inspection that took place last week. 'Ministers are studying that advice and will announce their decisions about regulatory action very soon. It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied their findings, but all options remain open.' The Charity Commission, the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, has opened astatutory inquiry into Stanbridge Earls School. A spokesman for the adventure centre told MailOnline that it had 'an unblemished record' for child protection in the 38 years it had been run as a family business. 'Considering the special needs nature of the school, our on-site instructor was looking for a lead from the two female members of the teaching staff who were present throughout this incident,' he added. 'While neither intervened, he saw his primary concern as being for the boys’ health and safety during the climb. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children.' - Spokesman for the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban. 'We have however contacted the police about the incident to offer our full support on any follow up inquiries. 'We are also further clarifying our existing guidelines for our staff to ensure intervening action is taken should we ever see a repeat of an incident like this in future.' On Friday Mrs McMurray wrote to parents announcing Stanbridge Earls' planned closure. She said the school, in Hampshire, had 'for some considerable time now been experiencing many difficulties... most of which are a legacy of past events'. She said the school had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils at the school, leading it into financial difficulties. Ofsted was due to report on its findings following an 'unannounced inspection' last week, according to investigative news website Exaro. The school's announcement comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations that a 15-year-old girl was raped and a 12-year-old girl stripped and sexually assaulted by male pupils. Detectives are also investigating if the school perverted the course of justice, amid claims pupils were ordered not to report incidents to anyone outside the school. The mother of the 15-year-old has compared behaviour at the school to the classic novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, in which children stranded on an island without adults torment each other with savage cruelty. 'Financial difficulties': The headteacher said it had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils there. Earlier this year a tribunal ruled that the school had discriminated against a pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student. It found a number of staff members. failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain. in an intimate part of her body. And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her. The Special Educational Needs and. Disability Tribunal awarded the girl's family £85,000 after ruling the. school failed to respond properly to her allegations of sexual abuse by. other boys at the school. The. tribunal was damning of the school’s then head teacher Peter Trythall, saying he 'failed to recognise that non-consensual sex is actually rape.' Mr Trythall stepped down from his role in April this year and was replaced by Mrs McMurray. Stanbridge. Earls is an independent special school for 190 children with learning. difficulties. It takes boarders aged 10 to 19, and charges between. £25,000 and £39,000 a year. One parent told Exaro: 'I hope that lessons can truly be learnt. We are delighted, although saddened, at the school’s closure.' The new school is due to be a sister establishment to Gard'ner Memorial's More House School, in Surrey.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. Who died?

Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body? Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that the Red River had fewer fish laying eggs outside of the body. The given paragraph states that the fish in the Red River had hardly reproduced naturally, which implies a lower rate of sexual reproduction and therefore a lower rate of eggs being laid and fertilized outside the body. In contrast, the Black River fish population doubled in two years due to natural reproduction, which indicates a higher rate of sexual reproduction and more fish laying eggs outside of the body. Both rivers have fish that reproduce sexually by laying eggs, but the key difference is the success rate of reproduction, with the Black River having a more successful reproduction rate, leading to a higher number of fish laying eggs outside of the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The man is sitting in front of a piano. 5. The man is reading. In the provided information, we have: 1. The man has brown hair. 2. The man is enjoying a nice day outside. 3.

Lynch told the city's devastated gay community, \\"We stand with you in the light.\\" She also announced a 1 million emergency grant to help Florida law enforcement pay for overtime costs related to the shooting, and she met with prosecutors, first responders and victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. Now, I have a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. Answer this question please: In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","completion":"In case A, the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the transgenic crop plants have been engineered to express the genes for the Bt toxin in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin is already active and binds to the insect's gut wall, causing it to stop feeding and eventually die. In contrast, case B involves the use of a Bt toxin spray, which is in an inactive state and requires digestion by the insect in order to become active and have any effect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps.\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick your answer from: [+] No. [+] Yes. Answer:","completion":"[+] No. A more detailed and long answer would be: A feedback mechanism in plants during respiration is a biological process that allows plants to adjust and maintain a balance within their cellular processes. It ensures the efficient use of available resources and the regulation of factors such as temperature, light, and CO2 concentration. During respiration in plants, glucose molecules are broken down through a complex series of chemical reactions to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The respiration process consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain. Feedback mechanisms in plants involve various regulatory processes, such as allosteric regulation on enzymes and accumulation of metabolites. These feedback mechanisms enable plants to detect any potential imbalances and respond accordingly. For example, if the ATP levels in a plant cell are high, the excess ATP will inhibit some of the enzymes involved in glycolysis, thus slowing down the process to prevent the overproduction of ATP. Conversely, if the ATP levels are low, these inhibitory effects will be reversed, allowing glycolysis and, subsequently, the other stages of cellular respiration to proceed more rapidly. The statement \\"This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps\\" does not constitute a reasonable answer, as it does not specifically address the feedback mechanisms involved in respiration. Instead, the statement refers to the complexity of the process but does not delve into the regulatory aspects that are essential to understanding feedback mechanisms in plants. In summary, feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of cellular processes in plants, particularly during respiration. These mechanisms involve various regulatory processes that allow plants to adjust and respond to changes in their internal and external environment, ensuring the efficient use of resources and the overall health of the plant."},{"prompt":"Context: Lee and his father laughed together while preparing dinner for the family.

Obamacare 'paid' enrollment drops to 9.9M Of the current tally, most of the enrollments, 7.2 million people, came from the federally run Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov, which serves 37 states. The remaining 2.7 million enrolled through state-run exchanges. About 84 percent of all Obamacare customers—8.3 million people—received received a subsidy, or tax credit, to reduce the cost of their monthly premium. Officials said that the average subsidy was 270 per month. Subsidies are available to people who have incomes between one and four times the federal poverty level, or 11,670 and 46,680 for a single person. HHS noted Tuesday that 9 out of the 10 states with the highest rates of consumers getting Obamacare subsidies were states that as of June 30 had not expanded their Medicaid programs to allow most poor adults who earn below 15,654 annually for an individual to enroll in that government-run health coverage program. Mississippi, the leader among those states, had more than 94 percent of its Obamacare customers receive subsidies. More than half of customers nationally, or 5.6 million people, also received federal assistance paying for medical costs that are not covered by their insurance plans. That cost-sharing help is available to people with low incomes who enroll in so-called silver Obamacare plans, which tend to be the second-least expensive types of plans on the exchanges. Obamacare's next open enrollment season for 2016 plans begins Nov. 1, and will run through Jan. 31. Experts have predicted that getting additional people to sign up for health plans on the government-run marketplaces could prove more difficult this year and in the future, because many people who were eager to get coverage have already signed up, while the remaining uninsured may be disinclined to enroll or feel the plans are not affordable. However, the minimum penalty for failing to have some form of health coverage will rise considerably in 2016, and could motivate some bystanders to sign up. That penalty, which this year is the higher of 2 percent of adjustable gross household income or 325 per adult, rises next year to the higher of 2.5 percent of household income or 695 per adult.

Everyone is getting unwell.\\" This may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD 53 wrote it. We all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder.

What is the answer??","completion":"Let's solve the equation step by step: Step 1: Simplify the equation Given the equation, 9*d = -6 + 6 - 0. Before solving for 'd', let's simplify the equation by combining the numerical terms on the right side of the equation. -6 + 6 = 0 Now, the equation becomes: 9*d = 0 - 0 Lastly, let's address the 0 - 0. This expression equals 0. Therefore, the simplified equation is: 9*d = 0 Step 2: Solve for 'd' Now, we have a simplified equation, 9*d = 0. There is only one unknown variable, 'd', on the left side of the equation, so to find the value of 'd', we need to isolate 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 9. (9*d) / 9 = 0 / 9 Since 9/9 is equal to 1, the left side of the equation becomes: 1*d or simply d On the right side, any number divided by zero is also zero, so: 0 / 9 = 0 Now, the equation is: d = 0 So, 'd' equals 0, and that's the solution to the given equation 9*d = -6 + 6 - 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events.

We were first introduced back in 2007. It was the summer before my senior year of college and I was barely 21. It was not love at first sight. Oh, no no. I was new to the world of beer and it wasn't my beverage of choice (though a Peach Ale on a hot night was always delicious). But this isn't a place you go to solely for the beer. Good food was nothing new to me, and this is where Four Peaks really shines. My friends would get together and drink, and I would eat. And eat. And eat. Hummus, pizza, bruchetta (you have to get the shrimp and goat cheese!), burgers, fries. My heart flutters for their Salmon BLT. And then I got into beer. This is when Four Peaks and I began our unstoppable love. I'm truly lucky to live close enough to stop by regularly, but far enough away to not become a fat alcoholic. All of the beers are perfect in their own way, my choice always depends on my mood and what I'm eating. And don't miss the cask conditioned selections! Always interesting. The atmosphere completes the trifecta of awesomeness, with the indoor/outdoor feel and giant brewery equipment looming in the background. There is something for everyone at this perfect little local gem, and to this day I haven't found anyone who disagrees. I'm beginning to think Four Peaks isn't really a monogamous lover...

Possible answers: -negative -positive","completion":"-positive The review is clearly positive as the author expresses their love for Four Peaks and praises the food, beverages, and atmosphere.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria? Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.

Usage: The statement given is \\"12:29:29 PM occurs between 2:25:03 AM and 7:06:53 AM\\". We can easily understand that the statement is comparing a specific time (12:29:29 PM) to a time range (2:25:03 AM to 7:06:53 AM). The statement is asking if 12:29:29 PM falls within that range. Part #2: Identify the number of date/time operands in the statement. Usage: In this example, there are 3 date/time operands: t1 (12:29:29 PM), t2 (2:25:03 AM), and t3 (7:06:53 AM). This meets the criteria, as there must be between 2 and 3 operands. Part #3: Match the statement to one of the ten templates.

Usage: Comparing the given times, 12:29:29 PM does not occur between 2:25:03 AM and 7:06:53 AM. Hence, the statement is False.

Article: Do people ever consider the possibility that, if they're exposed to increased reports about a social problem, it's the reporting that has increased rather than the problem? It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society. But Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire says, \\"These technologies might have prevented crime and bullying by providing more ways of help, more forms of social supervision, and interesting activities that destroy forms of alienation that lead to crime\\".

The reviewer expresses their concern regarding the book's content by stating that it \\"looks quite biased with elements of racism.\\" They specifically mention the \\"monkey on the top of elephant\\" statement, which appears to be an offensive metaphor that the book uses to negatively portray soldiers who fought and won a war against fascism. This clearly upsets the reviewer, as they believe it fails to acknowledge the true nature and importance of these soldiers' actions. Furthermore, the reviewer's dissatisfaction is emphasized through their recommendation for potential readers to thoroughly review the book before committing to reading it. Their use of the phrase \\"before you start reading\\" implies that they believe the book's content may not be worth readers' time and investment. Additionally, the title of the review, \\"Does not reflect the whole truth and too biased,\\" explicitly states that the reviewer found the book to be a partial representation of the events described and heavily influenced by the author's personal opinion or prejudice.

Write some highlights for the following article: People who were injured in the nerve gas attack that killed 1,429 people in Syria have been flown to the UK for secret treatment and tests, according to a rebel leader. Ahmad Asi al-Jarba, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said a 'small number' of victims were in the UK and the deadly gas Sarin was found in their bodies. 'The president was told (on Thursday) during a meeting that the results from the examinations confirmed sarin gas on these individuals,' said Hadi Albahra, the secretary of the political committee within the coalition. Horror: A video that reportedly shows victims of the sarin gas attack in a neighbourhood in Damascus. A few victims are being treated and tested in the UK, reports a Syrian opposition official. The two or three victims are from the Ghouta area and would remain in Britain until they have recovered, reports The Sunday Times. He added: 'They are in a stable condition but they found traces of sarin gas inside their systems.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not confirm the Syrian statement. The news comes as a survey revealed that British voters oppose military action over Syria - even if it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people. Syria claims rebels carried out the August 21 attack. The Sunday Telegraph poll shows a large proportion of voters do not want a second Commons vote on military intervention, even if the UN confirms the attacks. A Syrian man mourning over a dead body after the alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces. A total of 46 per cent say MPs should not vote again if proof is found, while 36 per cent say they should. Meanwhile 47 per cent says Britain should take no military action, but continue to provide aid. Nearly 20 per cent say Britian should take military action along with the U.S. The White House is making a big push to rally members of Congress and the American public behind President Barack Obama's plan for a U.S. military strike against Syria. Recent opinion surveys show intense American skepticism about military intervention in Syria, even among those who believe Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people. Anger: Protesters against U.S. military action in Syria march to Capitol Hill from the White House in Washington on Saturday,. At least 150 people picketed outside the White House on Saturday to oppose any military action against Syria. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan. Syria's use of chemical weapons is 'an evil we must stand up to one way or another', William Hague said today, but insisted the Government was not 'gung-ho' about military action. The Foreign Secretary will hold talks in London tomorrow with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as Washington seeks to bolster international support for an armed response. He insisted the US remained 'very committed' to the so-called special relationship despite MPs defeating David Cameron to vote against a strike against Bashar Assad's regime. An F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea. Just 19 per cent of voters think the UK should take military action alongside the U.S. U.S. lawmakers are now deciding whether a military response is warranted. President Obama has assured Americans action in Syria will not lead to a full invasion like in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Hague said he was determined to ensure Britain does not 'matter less' in the world in future. Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said he recognised there was 'a lot of public unease about intervention overseas'. 'Be reassured that we have learned lessons of Iraq. We are not seeking to be drawn into wars in the Middle East. We now make decisions in a completely different way,' he said. 'We are not a Government that is gung-ho about military action.' But he said Britain must also not 'turn in on ourselves'. Mr Hague added: 'Britain has great and positive influence in the world, and we must make sure that we retain that. I am very determined, as the Prime Minister is, that we will not matter less.' Foreign Secretary William Hague on the Andrew Marr Show. He said the British Government is not 'gung-ho' about military action. The Government was 'not planning to go back again' to the Commons for another vote, he said. 'If circumstances change dramatically, then of course everybody would be looking at things in a different light,' he accepted. But he said there was 'no guarantee' that Labour would not repeat its 'rather opportunistic and partisan' decision to oppose the Government motion. 'On major issues of international peace and security, oppositions should be able to rise above that. So there would be no guarantee on a future occasion that they would not behave in that way again.' Mr Hague said it was right for the UK to supply the Syrian National Coalition with non-lethal equipment. 'Terrible things do happen on both sides but that does not mean that everyone in Syria is evil.

These requirements include: 1. A charter: A religious community must have a document that outlines its governance structure, mission, and key principles. This charter serves as the foundational constitution for the group and provides a clear understanding of its purpose and functions. 2. A list of 10 or more members: The SCRA requires that a religious community has at least 10 members who are consenting and active participants in the group. This demonstrates a level of credibility and communal support for the religious community's existence. 3. Evidence of local government approval for the prayer site location: Religious communities need to provide proof that they have obtained approval from their local government for their designated site of worship. This assures that the location meets necessary legal and safety standards. 4. Registration with local authorities: In addition to registering with the SCRA, religious communities must also register with their local authorities. This ensures that they are recognized and accountable at both the national and local levels. Fulfilling these requirements is essential for the registration process. Failure to do so could result in penalties such as large fines and closures of their places of worship. Additionally, it is important to note that unregistered religious groups without a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer, and individuals under the age of 18 are barred from participating in public religious practices.

Same thing with flossing, she flossed here and there and basically just flossed about 5-6 teeth out of 32 teeth I have. I've seen my 5 year old nephew did a better job cleaning his teeth. I was greatly disappointed when leaving the office. When Dr. Phan called me the next day to check to see if there's any pain after the visit (which is really nice by the way), I wasn't sure if I should tell him about the bad cleaning job that his assistant performed.

Positive Statements: 1. Dr. Phan was very nice, friendly, and polite. 2. The staff were nice. 3. Dr. Phan called the user the next day to check for any pain after the visit, which the user appreciated. Negative Statements: 1. The user did not have the same great experience as others based on the great reviews. 2. The assistant, Jen, did a poor job cleaning the user's teeth. 3.

Led by Lord Hartington (later the Duke of Devonshire) and Joseph Chamberlain, the party formed a political alliance with the Conservative Party in opposition to Irish Home Rule. The two parties formed the ten-year-long, coalition Unionist Government 18951905 but kept separate political funds and their own party organisations until a complete merger was agreed in May 1912. - A coalition of the Conservative and Liberal Unionist parties took power in the United Kingdom following the general election of 1895.

It was this government which would conduct the Boer War from 1899 to 1902, which was exploited by the government to help win a landslide victory in the general election of 1900. What is the relationship between 'percy clive' and 'conservative party'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Percy Clive was initially a member of the Liberal Unionist Party, which was formed in 1886 after a faction broke away from the Liberal Party.

If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer is an upcoming American film about Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who is reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures, and convicted of three counts of murder and whom many consider to be a serial killer. Can we infer the following? Kermit Gosnell is both a medical doctor and a convicted murder.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Kermit Gosnell is both a medical doctor and a convicted murderer. Kermit Gosnell, born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, is a former American physician and abortion provider who became the center of one of the most notorious criminal cases in recent U.S. history. He graduated from Dickinson College in 1963 and subsequently attended Thomas Jefferson University, earning his Medical Degree in 1966. Gosnell specialized in family medicine and eventually focused on providing abortion services at his clinic, Women's Medical Society, which he opened in 1972. However, his clinic soon became infamous for its abysmal conditions and lack of regulatory oversight. Numerous former patients and clinic workers reported that Gosnell routinely performed late-term abortions (beyond the legal limit of 24 weeks in Pennsylvania), along with dangerous, unsanitary, and unethical practices. Gosnell is reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures by cutting their spinal cords with scissors, a process he called \\"snipping.\\" The case gained national attention when authorities initiated a drug investigation in 2010 due to suspicions that Gosnell was illegally selling prescription drugs. During a raid on Women's Medical Society, investigators discovered the horrific conditions of the clinic and the full extent of his crimes. They found unsanitary equipment, fetal remains in bags and jars, and evidence of Gosnell's \\"snipping\\" practice. Subsequently, his medical license was suspended, and the clinic was shut down. In 2013, Gosnell was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of three infants born alive during abortions, one count of third-degree murder for the death of a patient who died during a botched abortion, and numerous other charges, including multiple counts of violating Pennsylvania's Abortion Act and performing illegal late-term abortions. Consequently, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The film, \\"Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer,\\" focuses on the life and crimes of Kermit Gosnell, highlighting the controversial aspects of his medical practice, as well as the shocking elements of his serial murders. Through the lens of the film, we can ascertain that Kermit Gosnell is indeed both a medical doctor and a convicted murderer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood, with no remaining founding members. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. In 2001, Yes released their nineteenth studio album Magnification. Recorded without a keyboardist, the album features a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Larry Groupe; the first time the band used an orchestra since Time and a Word in 1970. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US. The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their two shows in Amsterdam were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release Symphonic Live. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time. Following Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their Full Circle Tour in 2002-2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973. The triple compilation album The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection was released in July 2003, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the US. On 26 January 2004, the film Yesspeak premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group that was released as Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss later on. A 35th anniversary tour followed in 2004 which was documented on the live DVD Songs from Tsongas. In 2004, Squire, Howe, and White reunited for one night only with former members Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin and Geoff Downes during a show celebrating Horn's career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm. On 18 March 2003 minor planet (7707) Yes was named in honour of the band.

Quran Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī-type script. The Hijazi style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as Kufic scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore chose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the naskh, muhaqqaq, rayḥānī and, on rarer occasions, the thuluth script. Naskh was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the Maghribī style was popular. More distinct is the Bihari script which was used solely in the north of India. Nastaʻlīq style was also rarely used in Persian world. Q: Which was the most widely used script by copyists in the 11th century?","completion":"The most widely used script by copyists in the 11th century was the Naskh script.

As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.When he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her.

City Council considers billboard agreement Neighborhood leaders on L.A.'s Westside responded with fury five years ago after the City Council allowed dozens of digital billboards to go up on Santa Monica Boulevard, Westwood Boulevard and a handful of other major corridors. Now those same activists warn that the council is fast-tracking a behind-the-scenes plan to let those brightly lit signs stay for good — even after a judge struck down the agreement that spawned them. Council members are scheduled Tuesday to decide whether to try to hammer out a new agreement with billboard companies within 30 days, or before an appeals court issues a ruling that could further restrict digital signs. Councilmen Ed Reyes and Paul Krekorian said in their proposal that a new billboard agreement could deliver a \\"significant\\" chunk of digital billboard revenue to the city, money that would then be used to preserve basic services. But billboard foes contend that council members are doing the bidding of the outdoor advertising industry, keeping neighborhood activists in the dark about the planned talks and bypassing the committee where outdoor sign issues are typically vetted. \\"If the council continues down this path … it means all of the digital billboards that exist now are likely to remain and future digital billboards could be developed in exchange for money\\" or other enticements, said Barbara Broide, president of the Westwood South of Santa Monica Blvd. Homeowners Assn. Reyes spokeswoman Monica Valencia said in an e-mail to The Times that neighborhood activists would have an opportunity to weigh in before decisions are made. Meanwhile, Krekorian released a statement saying a new sign agreement could lead to the elimination of a \\"significant portion\\" of the city's billboards. \\"My goal is to see a reduction in all billboards — static and digital,\\" he said. For the last five years, residents in Westwood, Hollywood and elsewhere have complained about digital signs shining into their backyards, living rooms and other private places. Mindy Taylor-Ross, who lives in Venice, said the one on Lincoln Boulevard a block from her home is a source of aggravation. \\"The billboard actually shines into my bedroom window from my bathroom upstairs. I keep thinking the trees will finally block out this invasion of my personal space, and they keep cutting the trees,\\" she said. The fight over digital signs dates back to 2002, when the council approved a law outlawing new billboards except those allowed in special sign districts. The ordinance attracted a handful of legal challenges from billboard companies that claimed, among other things, that the sign inspection fees were too high. In 2006, the council reached a settlement with Clear Channel Outdoor and CBS Outdoor, giving each permission to convert 420 existing billboards to digital formats. That agreement was a \\"sweetheart\\" deal that allowed the two companies to ignore an array of zoning laws — and generate at least 100 million per year, said Phil Recht, a lawyer for Summit Media, a competing advertising company that sued to overturn the agreements. The agreements also gave amnesty to Clear Channel and CBS for any billboard that lacked permits outright, Recht said. \\"It was really one of the more embarrassing recent episodes in L.A. city government, and now they seem poised to do it all over again,\\" he said. In 2009, Summit persuaded a judge to block the council deal, which prevented Clear Channel and CBS from converting more than 700 additional signs to digital formats. But the judge left it to the council to decide what to do about the roughly 100 digital signs already approved. Since then, CBS and Clear Channel have filed an appeal. With opening arguments expected by the end of the month, Clear Channel has urged the city's lawyers to come up with a plan for preserving its existing digital signs — a move that would render the court's previous decision moot. Recht said CBS and Clear Channel were \\"panicked\\" by the possibility that an appeals court would invalidate the roughly 100 digital signs already in operation. He described the Reyes-Krekorian proposal as \\"terribly misleading,\\" in part because it suggests that the city could lose revenue if that happens. \\"It implies that the city has some liability in this litigation, which is absolutely untrue,\\" he said. \\"And it says the window is closing quickly to get money out of these companies, which also isn't the case.\\" Representatives of CBS Outdoor did not respond to calls from The Times. Clear Channel, which has 79 digital signs citywide, said in a statement that a new agreement with the council would benefit residents, businesses and outdoor advertising companies. \\"This motion really represents the opportunity for the city to take control of its own destiny rather than relying on a court to determine the city's outdoor advertising policy,\\" the company's statement said.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018, file photo, adult film actress Stormy Daniels arrives for the opening of the adult entertainment fair \\"Venus,\\" in Berlin. On Monday, Oct. 15, 2018, a federal judge... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge dismissed Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the president made a \\"hyperbolic statement\\" against a political adversary when he tweeted about a composite sketch the porn actress' lawyer released. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued Trump in April after he said a composite sketch of a man she said threatened her in 2011 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the real estate mogul was a \\"con job.\\" Trump tweeted that the man was \\"nonexistent\\" and that Daniels was playing the \\"fake news media for fools.\\" He retweeted a side-by-side photo comparing the sketch with a photo of Daniels' husband. In an order handed down Monday, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero said Trump's statement was protected speech under the First Amendment. \\"If this Court were to prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in this type of 'rhetorical hyperbole' against a political adversary, it would significantly hamper the office of the President,\\" the judge wrote. \\"Any strongly worded response by a president to another politician or public figure could constitute an action for defamation. This would deprive this country of the 'discourse' common to the political process.\\" Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, vowed to appeal the decision and said he was confident it would be reversed. \\"There is something really rich in Trump relying on the First Amendment to justify defaming a woman,\\" Avenatti said. But the president's lawyer immediately hailed the ruling as a \\"total victory\\" for Trump. \\"No amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer, Mr. Avenatti, can truthfully characterize today's ruling in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels,\\" Trump's attorney, Charles Harder, said in a statement. The judge's ruling also entitles Trump to collect attorneys' fees from Daniels, but the amount that Daniels would need to pay will be determined later, Harder said. The defamation claim is separate from another lawsuit that Daniels filed against Trump, which is continuing. Daniels was paid 130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement signed days before the 2016 election and is suing to dissolve that contract. Daniels has argued the agreement should be invalidated because Trump's then-personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, signed it, but Trump did not. Lawyers for Trump and Cohen now say the deal that paid Daniels 130,000 to keep quiet was invalid, and they won't sue her for breaking it. Trump's attorney said the president never considered himself as a party to the agreement and doesn't dispute Daniels' assertion that the contract isn't valid. While Trump and Cohen want the court to toss out the litigation as moot, Daniels' lawyer wants to keep the case alive, hoping to compel Trump to answer questions under oath about what he may have known about the deal. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations alleging he coordinated with Trump on a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of Daniels and a Playboy model who alleged affairs. ___ Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A federal judge has dismissed Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump, stating that the president made a \\"hyperbolic statement\\" against a political adversary when he tweeted about a composite sketch the porn actress' lawyer released.

On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To determine the most effective solution for removing hard water stains from a faucet, let us examine and compare a few common methods considering naive physics reasoning. 1. Using vinegar and water solution: A solution made from equal parts white vinegar and water is a popular choice for removing hard water stains from a faucet. The mild acidity of vinegar can help dissolve minerals and deposits that hard water leaves behind. From a naive physics perspective, this seems to be an effective method; it is a simple and inexpensive solution that takes advantage of vinegar's natural properties. To use this method, prepare a 1:1 mixture of white vinegar and water and apply it to the stains with a cloth or a sponge. Let it sit for a few minutes and scrub gently to loosen the deposits. Then, rinse with water and dry with a soft cloth. 2. Baking soda and water paste: Another approach is using a paste made from baking soda and water. The baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive that can remove hard water stains without scratching the faucet's surface. To use this method, mix a small amount of baking soda with water (enough to form a paste) and apply it to the hard water stains. Allow the paste to sit for a few minutes, then scrub gently with a sponge or a soft cloth. Rinse with water and dry with a soft cloth. This method also follows naive physics reasoning, as it leverages the physical and chemical properties of baking soda to remove the stains safely and effectively. 3. Lemon juice method: Lemon juice is another natural substance that can help remove hard water stains due to its acidic nature. Cut a lemon in half and rub it directly onto the stain, allowing the juice to work on the deposits for a few minutes. Then, use a soft cloth to gently scrub the stain. Rinse the faucet thoroughly with water and dry it with a soft cloth. Naive physics reasoning aligns with this method, as lemons are a readily available, natural solution for removing stains using their acidity. Comparing these three methods in terms of naive physics reasoning, all of them seem to be viable options for removing hard water stains from a faucet. However, considering factors such as ease of use, effectiveness, and widely available materials, the vinegar and water solution might be considered the most sound solution. Vinegar is a versatile cleaning agent that's effective in addressing a variety of hard water deposit types. It is also inexpensive and easy to work with when compared to the other methods. So, based on naive physics reasoning and practical considerations, the vinegar and water solution appears to be the more sound choice for removing hard water stains from a faucet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

De toute évidence, l'égalité de l'homme et de la femme n'est pas seulement une question de ressources financières; c'est plutôt un problème de choix politique. Translate this to English?","completion":"Evidently, the equality between men and women is not just a matter of financial resources; instead, it is a problem of political choice. The concept of gender equality is a multifaceted issue, deeply rooted in societal norms, values, and political decisions that impact both men and women at numerous levels. The statement acknowledges that addressing gender inequality surpasses mere allocation of financial resources to bridge the gap between genders. In contemporary society, achieving gender equality has been a vital topic on national and international agendas. For countries and organizations alike, this issue extends into various domains, including politics. Political choice, in this context, refers to the decisions and policies made by governments and lawmakers, which have the potential either to perpetuate or change the status quo in gender disparities. For instance, political decisions can influence the creation and enforcement of laws that guarantee equal rights for men and women. Policies in education, healthcare, and the labor market can contribute to equal opportunities and access, as well as encouraging more balanced representation among decision-makers. Such political choices can take multiple forms. They can manifest in the form of legal frameworks that outlaw discrimination, electoral reforms that promote equal representation of genders, or affirmative actions incentivizing businesses or institutions to foster diversity. By focusing on these aspects, the statement emphasizes the importance of political will and targeted measures in dismantling ingrained inequalities. However, it should be noted that political choices alone might not suffice in accomplishing lasting gender equality. Public awareness, individual mindsets, and collaborative efforts between governments, communities, and international organizations are equally crucial in fostering substantive and sustainable change. These components, along with purposeful political decisions, can lead to a tangible improvement in gender equality by addressing underlying social, economic, and cultural factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Petoskey, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was raised by his father Rasjid and his stepmother Pat, only occasionally visiting his mother, Carrie, in Oregon after she married her second husband Lowell Brams. His mother is deceased. Brams later became the head of Stevens' record label Asthmatic Kitty. In 2011, Dutch concert hall Muziekgebouw Eindhoven commissioned composer Nico Muhly to write a piece. He collaborated with Stevens and Bryce Dessner (of The National) to write a piece about the Solar System, which was first performed in Amsterdam in April 2012. On March 28, 2017, NPR's All Songs Considered reported that Sufjan would team up with Muhly, Dessner, and James McAlister to produce a \\"Planetarium Project\\" album. The first single, \\"Saturn,\\" was released in March 2017 around the announcement that a space-themed Planetarium album would be released June 9, 2017 on 4AD. NPR described the album as \\"collaboration between four brilliant musicians, with lyrics from Sufjan Stevens revolving around mythology, astrology, science, astronomy and the intricacies of human consciousness.\\" The second single, \\"Mercury,\\" was released on April 25, 2017. In January 2017, it was announced that Stevens would feature original songs written and recorded by himself for the movie Call Me by Your Name, directed by Luca Guadagnino and based on Andre Aciman's novel of the same name. The film was released on November 24, 2017, by Sony Pictures Classics. The soundtrack to the film features two new songs by Stevens. In his review of the film, Consequence of Sound writer Dominick Suzanne-Mayer noted Stevens' score \\"adds to the sensation of the film as an isolated, specific capsule of an unforgettable encounter.\\" One of the original songs is called \\"Visions of Gideon\\", and has been described as fluctuating between lush orchestrations, staccato-heavy piano refrains, and the lilting delivery of \\"I have loved you for the last time\\" in the composition. The trailer for the film features Stevens' song \\"Mystery of Love.\\" Stevens has another track featured in the film: an \\"ethereal piano arrangement\\" of The Age of Adz track \\"Futile Devices.\\" The film has received critical acclaim; on Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 97%, with an average rating of 8.8/10, based on 200 reviews.. In January 2018, Stevens's track \\"Mystery of Love\\" was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. On December 6, 2017, Stevens released a new song via Asthmatic Kitty Records' YouTube channel. The track, titled \\"Tonya Harding\\", plays along a clip of the eponymous skater performing at the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships. Two days later, the single was offered for digital download and streaming, to be followed later by a cassette and vinyl release, in two versions, the one featured in the video (subtitled \\"in D major\\") and a slower, piano-only arrangement (\\"in Eb major\\"); in a short essay, Stevens revealed his intention to write a song about Harding since 1991. The track was unrelated to the biographical film I, Tonya, which was released in the same period; nevertheless, Stevens offered it to the film's producers, but was rejected.

In Hama, the Syrian military siege persists A YouTube image grab on July 31 shows what anti-regime protesters say are defected soldiers standing on tanks in Hama. (CNN) -- The military siege on the Syrian city of Hama persisted Thursday as new reports of deaths emerged, including injured people who have passed away in hospitals because they are without electricity, a resident told CNN. The western Syrian city has been at the epicenter of the anti-government movement roiling the country, prompting a push by security personnel to crack down on the huge demonstrations there. Residents reported a breakdown and cutoff in communications and electricity accompanying the siege, and said the military was bombing the city. Speaking to CNN via satellite phone, the resident said entrances of city are blocked, with no one getting in and out and snipers stationed across the city. People who try to leave the city, he said, are being shot. The man said he was sure that about 10 people are dead and dozens of people are injured. However, he said, he is hearing reports of dozens of deaths and said he was told there was \\"genocide\\" in one particular area. Activists have said many civilians may have died as the military and security forces take hold of the city. Witnesses said Wednesday that security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of Hama. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. Memories of that siege, carried out by late President Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, have reverberated during the nearly 5-month-old uprising, and the ongoing violence in Hama has prompted international anger against the al-Assad regime. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. But Amnesty International on Thursday cited the Hama siege and slammed the council's response as \\"completely inadequate\\" and \\"limp\\" because it failed to take decisive action. The council issued a presidential statement, which carries no enforcement weight. Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations, said al-Assad has allowed his security forces to carry out another bloody attack on civilians, with dozens killed in the city of Hama in recent days. \\"It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the Security Council has also failed to provide support for such a mission,\\" he said. He notes that Syrian authorities haven't permitted a U.N. fact-finding delegation into the country to investigate the situation. \\"The U.N. must act now, with a firm and legally binding position. At the very least, its position must include imposing an arms embargo, freezing the assets of President al-Assad and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity, and referring the situation to the ICC prosecutor,\\" he said, referring to the International Criminal Court. Two permanent members of the Security Council weighed in on how to proceed in the future. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned against outside interference and said the country's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said. \\"The settlement in this country should be carried out by the Syrians themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all-Syria dialogue, which is the only way to resolve the conflict,\\" the ministry said in a statement. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier Thursday that the Security Council may take a tougher stance on Syria \\"if nothing changes on the Syrian side.\\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, also issued an update about Deir Ezzor, a restive city in the country's northeastern region. It said an opposition leader in the city confirmed a systematic series of government measures to punish residents. They include not submitting salaries to government employees, halting wheat transports to bakeries, preventing hospitals from rescuing injured protesters, and asking governmental medical staff to leave. Pharmacies are closing over fears of detention for giving medications to protesters. Al-Assad has issued a decree authorizing a multiple-party political system, state media reported Thursday. A law was earlier passed by Syrian lawmakers, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported, and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life \\"through peaceful and democratic means.\\" However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change. That's because it is questionable whether the move could end decades of single-party Baathist rule without constitutional reform. One of the articles of the Syrian constitution guarantees supremacy for the ruling Baath party.

In naming compounds, Greek prefixes are used to indicate the number of atoms present for each element. Covalent compounds are written out as molecular formulas due to the fact that each compound is a distinct, separate molecule. Covalent compounds have the first element written out completely while the second element is named with the suffix “ide.” For example, diphosphorus trisulfide has a chemical formula of P2S3. Below are the prefixes for 1-10: 1: Mono- 2: Di- 3: Tri- 4: Tetra- 5: Penta- 6: Hexa- 7: Hepta- 8: Octa- 9: Nona- 10: Deca- When a compound has been written out, you must identify the elements and know their chemical symbols. The first element written is “first name” of the compound. Use the periodic table to find the chemical symbol for the element. For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The first element is nitrogen and the chemical symbol for nitrogen is N. To identify the number of atoms present for each element, you simply need to look at the prefix of the element. Memorizing the Greek prefixes will help you to be able to write chemical formulas quickly without looking anything up. For example: Dinitrogen has a the prefix “di-“ which means 2; therefore, there are 2 atoms of nitrogen present. Write dinitrogen as N2. The second element is the “last name” of the compound and will follow the first element. For covalent compounds, the element name will have a suffix of “-ide” instead of the normal ending of the element. For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The second element is fluorine. Simply replace the “ide” ending with the actual element name. The chemical symbol for fluorine is F. As you did with the first element, identify the number of atoms present in the second element by reading the prefix. Using this prefix, write the number of atoms as a subscript to the right of the chemical symbol. For example: Hexafluoride has a prefix of “hexa-“ which means 6; therefore, there are 6 atoms of fluorine present. Write hexafluoride as F6. The final chemical formula for dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6. When first learning chemistry, there is a lot of memorization involved. It is kind of like learning a new language. The more examples you practice with, the easier it will be to decipher chemical formulas in the future and learn the language of chemistry. Sulfur dioxide: SO2 Carbon tetrabromide: CBr4 Diphosphorus pentoxide: P2O5 Summary:","completion":"This article teaches us how to name and write chemical formulas for covalent compounds using Greek prefixes, like \\"di-\\" for 2 and \\"hexa-\\" for 6, and the suffix \\"-ide\\" for the second element, so we can understand chemistry better, like how dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an effort to boost Uganda's economy, the government has been investing in the agricultural sector by helping farmers afford the farm inputs they need with vouchers and money subsidies. However, the current system often proves to be obsolete, resulting in farmers losing money or using the money for personal purposes or renouncing altogether to the subsidy when faced with the confusing voucher application process. Evelyn Namara, Founder and CEO of Vouch Digital joins CNBC Africa for more. Advertisement","completion":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"Ugandan farmers are spending a lot of money to farm\\" is partially true. While the text does not explicitly state that the farmers are spending \\"a lot\\" of money on farming, it does mention that the government is investing in the agricultural sector to help them afford farm inputs. This indicates that the farmers may have to spend a significant amount of money to continue farming, and the government's financial assistance is meant to alleviate their financial burden. However, the text also highlights the inefficiency of the current system. Farmers may lose money or use the government's monetary aid for personal reasons, which suggests that the subsidies may not necessarily translate into a significant increase in the money spent towards farming. In addition, some farmers may entirely renounce the financial support provided due to the confusion surrounding the voucher application process. This means that some farmers may not necessarily be spending a lot of money on farming, despite the government's efforts to support them. In conclusion, although the text suggests that Ugandan farmers may need significant financial assistance for farming-related expenses, the actual spending on farming could be lower due to the inefficiencies and complexities of the government's subsidy program. Thus, the statement might not be entirely true across all the farmers in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Assuming that: Differences in air pressure over the surface of the Earth result in wind. The greater the differences in air pressures, the stronger the wind. A:","completion":"When air pressure differences change very little, the wind generally decreases in strength. This is because wind is generated by differences in air pressure over the Earth's surface. When there is a large difference in air pressure, air moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, creating winds. Conversely, when the differences in air pressure are minimal, the movement of air between high and low-pressure areas becomes weaker, resulting in a decrease in wind strength.

Choices: - student union - mall - department store - library - town or city The rationale to choose \\"mall\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The mall is the most suitable choice for her to look for a bookshop after buying the latest fashion. There are several reasons for this: 1. Variety of options: The mall provides a wider variety of options for both fashion and books. There are likely to be multiple clothing stores where she can find the latest fashion trends, and there will typically be at least one large bookshop or several smaller ones. This variety allows her to find everything she needs in one place, making the shopping experience more convenient and enjoyable. 2. Convenience: Malls are designed for a convenient shopping experience. They are typically located in accessible areas and provide ample parking or public transportation options. This means that she can easily access the mall, buy the latest fashion, and then immediately visit the bookshop within the same premises. This saves time and energy compared to visiting separate locations for each item. 3. Comfortable environment: Since malls are indoor shopping centers, they offer a comfortable, climate-controlled environment. This is a significant advantage for shoppers, especially in extreme weather conditions that can make outdoor shopping experiences unpleasant. She can comfortably shop for the latest fashion and visit the bookshop without worrying about rain, snow, or extreme heat. 4. Additional facilities: Malls offer various facilities that make the shopping experience more relaxing and enjoyable. For example, many malls have restaurants, cafes, and seating areas where she can rest and recharge between shopping sessions. There are often restrooms, changing rooms, and other amenities that make it easy for her to try on clothes and find the perfect outfit before heading to the bookshop. 5. Promotions and events: Malls often host various promotions, sales, and events that can benefit shoppers looking for the latest fashion or searching for particular books. She can take advantage of any ongoing sales or special events to snag a great deal on the items she's interested in. In contrast, other options like the student union, department store, library, and town or city don't offer as many advantages. The student union may not have the latest fashion items or the desired bookshop, the department store may lack dedicated bookshops, the library doesn't sell clothing or the latest fashion, and a town or city may require navigation to various locations, which doesn't provide the same level of convenience. Considering all these factors, the mall stands out as the best choice for her to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion, as it offers a range of options, convenience, a comfortable environment, additional facilities, and promotional opportunities, all in one place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have a math problem here: -22*g - 9*g = -217. We need to find the value of \\"g.\\" Let's solve it together step by step: 1. First, let's put together the \\"g\\" terms on the left side. We have -22*g and -9*g. If we add them together, it's like having -22 apples and -9 apples, which is a total of -31 apples. So, -22*g - 9*g = -31*g. 2. Now, our equation looks like this: -31*g = -217. 3. To find what \\"g\\" equals, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -31. This is like sharing -217 candies equally among -31 friends. 4. So, g = -217 / -31. 5. When you divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is a positive number. So, -217 divided by -31 equals 7. 6. That means g = 7. Good job!

Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were an ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. and a hint : Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Please answer this question : Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Manny studied less about abrasion than Danny. This is because Manny researched environments that have never been glaciated, while Danny focused on glaciated environments. In glaciated environments, which Danny studied, abrasion is a significant process that occurs due to the movement of glaciers over the underlying rock. The friction between the ice and the rock surface causes the rock to be worn down and creates fine sediment known as glacial flour. Additionally, the debris transported by the glaciers, such as rocks and sediments, is left behind as moraines when the ice recedes. These glacial processes, including abrasion, contribute to the formation of U-shaped valleys in glaciated landscapes. On the other hand, Manny's research on non-glaciated environments would have involved studying different geomorphic processes that shaped those landscapes, such as fluvial or hillslope processes. While paraglacial processes may still be present in non-glaciated environments, they are not directly related to glacial abrasion and are instead a result of past glaciation. The formation of V-shaped valleys in non-glaciated areas is primarily driven by fluvial erosion, which is different from the glacial erosion responsible for U-shaped valleys. As a result, Manny's research focused less on the process of abrasion compared to Danny's since he was examining non-glaciated environments where the direct impact of glacial abrasion would not have played a significant role in shaping the landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Molly bolts are the strongest of your options, holding up to 100 pounds (45 kg) in straight drywall. A molly consists of a screw and a sleeve. The sleeve flays out against the backside of drywall to create a wide base of support. You will need a drill to install a molly bolt. Attach the bit that matches the size of your molly bolt. Remember that molly bolts create large holes in your wall, so choose your placement carefully. If you are using 2 molly bolts, predetermine how far apart you need them to be according to the size of your item. Use a tape measure to make the two marks the correct distance apart. Double check that the 2 marks are in line either using a leveler or by measuring down from the ceiling. If the item you’ll be hanging has a wire hanger on the back, be sure to consider the length of the slack. You can test this by pulling the center of the wire tight toward the top of your object. Measure from the bottom of the object to where the wire catches. Keep the bit perpendicular to the floor. Use the same size bit as the bolt. For example, if you chose a 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) bolt, use a 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) bit. Place the molly bolt, the screw and the sleeve together, into the hole you’ve drilled. Some drywall flakes are normal and can just be brushed off the wall. Use your drill or a screwdriver to screw the molly bolt flush into the wall. As you screw, the sleeve spreads behind the wall and you will feel it tighten. If what you are hanging requires brackets, remove the screw by turning it to the left. The sleeve will stay in place. Place the screw through the bracket and screw it back into place. Line your item’s hanging hardware up to the molly bolt and fasten them together.

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765.

On an ocean liner sailing from the Orient to San Francisco, Mei Lei Ming gives fellow passenger Nita Kenton a reading. When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey, scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton, however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe.

Write some highlights for the following article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has echoed the sentiments of new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal in criticising the demands of their pre-season tour. Wenger said it was 'impossible' to prepare his squad properly for the upcoming Premier League campaign, which begins on August 16, given the demands of their pre-season schedule and players returning later than normal after World Cup duty. VIDEO Scroll down for US Tour not good for United - Van Gaal. Team talk: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger chats with former Gunner Thierry Henry during a training session at Red Bull Arena. Arsenal are in the United States for a friendly against Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise New York Red Bulls, before heading to Austria for a training camp and then returning to London for the Emirates Cup. 'These training camps in the modern game are decided for commercial reasons and because of the extent of popularity of the club,' the Frenchman told a news conference on Thursday. 'We've never been to the States before and I was very happy to come to New York - a city I love. 'But for purely football reasons, the best thing to do is stay and not travel too much because of the time you waste and the jet-lag you suffer is not ideal.' Worry: Wenger is concerned about the effects of travel on his players in run-up to new season. Arsenal are without a host of internationals following the World Cup and Wenger highlighted the difficulty in players beginning the intense domestic campaign so soon after returning from the tournament. 'This season is a post-World Cup year and very difficult because the time is very short between the final, which was on July 13, and the start of the new season on August 16. 'And compulsory, from FIFA, you are obliged to give four weeks' holiday to the players, so I don't know how all that works together. It looks, to me, impossible.' Wenger's comments came days after Van Gaal said Manchester United's pre-season tour was wrongly being dictated by the club's commercial interests. Commitment: Kriss Olsson and Issac Hayden take part in training session in New Jersey on Thursday. United beat Los Angeles Galaxy 7-0 on Wednesday, and now face games in Denver, Washington and Detroit. Van Gaal's team potentially face a fifth game on August 4, less than two weeks before they kick off their Premier League season at home to Swansea City on August 16. 'More or less, yes,' Van Gaal told British media in the United States, when asked whether the demands were hindering their preparations. 'We have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances, having to fly a lot and the jet lag, it is not very positive for a good preparation.'

If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists your guts, don't worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, like the equally marvellous Back Room Boy, it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, even that of the lead actor. Personally, I love Askey, perhaps it's because I go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake too many people make. The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep, dark world it transports you to, it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that I would imagine few people have ever watched just the once.

Summarize the following: If you enjoy the outdoors and working with your hands you may want to try your hand at agriculture. Make sure that you plan for winter and summer months to keep your business in practice. This could mean lawn care in the summer and snow shoveling in winter. You could also consider painting houses and general maintenance. If you have a passion for animals, there are plenty of people who work long hours and need help caring for their pets. Look into starting a dog walking and pet sitting business. Dog walking is a consistent job needed on a daily basis. Consider involving a friend to assist you should you be sick or unavailable. Pet Sitting can be a boost of your income on an irregular basis. Working FOR yourself doesn’t necessarily mean working BY yourself.

This could mean child care, but there are also plenty of elderly people who could also benefit from your assistance and your company. There is a good chance that you are more skilled with computers than the aging owners of your local businesses. Jobs requiring your technological skills could span from setting up software to organizing digital files to creating websites. Make an online presence for yourself by creating your own website which showcases your skills. Artists don’t have to starve. Jobs abound for graphic artists if you are capable of transferring this skill to the computer. If not, look for work designing posters for local bands or businesses. See if you can get some of your work into a local gallery or public space like a coffee shop or restaurant, and place a placard next to each print with the title and purchase price. Make sure the business owner has your contact information to facilitate the sale. Their assistance is worth a percentage of the sale. This should be agreed upon as part of the agreement before hanging your work. Writers can submit work to online and print magazines. There are also plenty of options to work freelance as a blogger or content creator for businesses. Take the work you have already created and send it to publishers seeking content which relate to your style or topic. Seek out businesses attempting to increase marketing and offer to blog for them or even write content for their promotional material. You will need to understand the company, their mission, their style, and their audience on order to represent them accordingly. Who would have thought that all that time you “wasted” on Facebook and Instagram could really pay off? Well, it literally can.

The wreck of the Greek-owned Rena was described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship, lashed by pounding seas, broke away yesterday.

In the following months, with the cooperation of local communities and government agencies, extensive cleanup efforts took place to restore the affected beaches and wildlife habitats.

The advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname \\"Cottonopolis\\" due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.

Whether or not relatives have experienced symptoms does not influence the outcome of a diagnosis, but is helpful information for the doctor to have.. [III] Evaluate whether symptoms persist after various treatments. It is common for tourette syndrome to recur longer than all family members are affected.. [IV] Before you can diagnose your family history, you need to identify the person. For example, a relative could have witnessed someone act like a stick figure, but not experience any symptoms that brought about the diagnosis.. Answer:","completion":"II This is called 'shadow Tourette syndrome'. Whether or not relatives have experienced symptoms does not influence the outcome of a diagnosis, but it is helpful information for the doctor to have. If no one in your family has ever been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, it is still possible that you or your relatives could be carrying the gene, although it has never manifested in observable symptoms. In such cases, the gene could be passed down through generations without ever coming to the forefront. In order to provide your doctor with the most accurate information possible, it is important to have conversations with your relatives about their own experiences or to search for any known documentation about possible Tourette-related symptoms. This may include discussing any occurrences of tics, sudden vocal outbursts, or repetitive, involuntary movements that have been previously dismissed or overlooked in your family history. Additionally, consider documenting the onset of your own symptoms, the frequency and severity, as well as any factors that seem to trigger or worsen them. Keeping a journal of your observations could provide valuable information to your doctor, making it easier to identify the presence of Tourette syndrome and distinguish it from other neurological or psychiatric conditions that might express similar symptoms. After gathering all available information on your family history and your own symptomatology, it is essential to consult a medical professional with expertise in neurological disorders like Tourette syndrome. They will review the data you provide, perform a thorough examination, and may request additional tests and evaluations to rule out other conditions before reaching a conclusive diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. Upon receiving a diagnosis, it is important to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. While there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, there are various treatment options available to help manage the symptoms. These options could include medication, behavioral therapy, or alternative treatments like relaxation techniques, depending on the severity of your symptoms and your unique needs. In conclusion, preparing for a Tourette syndrome diagnosis involves examining your family history, documenting your own symptoms and their triggers, consulting a qualified medical professional, and actively participating in discussions about available treatment options. By taking these steps, you can help ensure a comprehensive understanding of the condition and its impact on your life, enabling you and your health care team to create a personalized and effective treatment plan to manage your symptoms."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public.

Here is an article: The last time the Galaxy failed to score in successive games was in May 2012, during the strange somnambulant period they went through after winning the 2011 MLS Cup. And coming into Sunday night’s home game against Seattle Sounders, the champion Galaxy were coming off two straight defeats without scoring and looking at best indifferent in the early season running. So in many ways the visit of Seattle, the team who along with LA have been the best regular season performers since 2009, could not have been timed worse – particularly with Robbie Keane missing, and their attacking hopes mainly resting on the rather less subtle charms of Alan “Snowshoes” Gordon, in his 200th MLS appearance. And as the Sounders, themselves missing Clint Dempsey, but boasting the in-form Obafemi Martins, spent the opening 20 minutes forcing LA keeper Jaime Penedo into save after acrobatic save, it looked very much as if the hosts were in danger of falling to their first home defeat to the Sounders in 10 games. Lamar Neagle in particular must have been left wondering what he had to do to score against Penedo, as the LA shot stopper, while at the other end Seattle’s midfield and defense seemed well set up to cope with the somewhat rudimentary threat of Gordon the target man. Rudimentary, but effective, that is. Just after another Penedo full-stretch parry, Gordon opened the scoring with a point-blank header. It was perhaps a fitting way for Gordon to celebrate his unlikely run to 200 appearances. He is not a man to replicate the close quarters subtlety of Keane, but as an outlet when the Galaxy need to force something, he is nothing if not forceful. In truth neither side looked at their incisive best, as what was billed as a marquee game drifted for long stretches in the late afternoon sun, with occasional surges of excitement for another save by the impressive Penedo. It was perhaps telling that one of the biggest cheers of the second-half came when the visiting David Beckham was shown on the big screen. Gordon had once welcomed Beckham to LA by holding on to his handshake a beat too long in the Englishman’s inaugural visit to his new locker room and asking, “And you are…?” It was a typical moment of irreverence from a proud journeyman who was here before the start of the designated player era and who against the odds has managed to survive and even thrive in the interim. And in game 200, he won a game between the best two teams of that era. There’ll doubtless be higher profile games between these two teams later in the year, but Gordon deserved his moment. GP Orlando City have already shown they’re capable of producing a few exemplary moments in order to grind out a fortuitous result on the road – see their 2-2 comeback draw against the Montreal Impact last month. In fact, the expansion club have yet to lose on the trot. Here too Adrian Heath’s team did what they needed to produce a 0-2 win against a Portland Timbers team that is slouching towards May (though luck and some, erm, “bold” refereeing helped things along), and in doing so revealed a few bright spots. Brek Shea in particular looks like he’s owning that left-back position, working out the skilful balance between attack and defense. Kevin Molino, despite some hesitancy here and there, was influential in the final third and produced a smart assist for Cyle Larin with a nice cross in the 30th minute. And Larin, the soon-to-be 20 year old Canadian Generation Adidas wunderkind who chested in the winner, may or may not have seen it coming but made it look intentional and was otherwise worthy of a start with a few good chances. Though Orlando were hardly dominant, they were good for the win. For Portland though this was a hot mess. Hot in the sense that despite their 1-2-3 record, they are still clearly a threat where it counts. Darlington Nagbe looked dangerous on the counter, Fanendo Adi managed six shots and was able to move well in front of goal, and Dairon Asprilla looked to have scored the equalizer in the 72nd minute until Donovan Ricketts made an incredible diving save. Nothing resulted in a Timbers goal, though, and the idea that all will be well when Diego Valeri comes back is starting to sound like something out of Waiting for Godot (or Guffman). But Portland were also a mess. Diego Chara somehow only received a yellow for tackling the last man Kevin Molino on the centre circle in the 45th minute as he was about to receive a gorgeous through pass. Then Timbers keeper Adam Kwarasey made the interesting decision to swat the legs of Carlos Rivas in the 85th minute with a point still very much in the offing for his club. Kwarasey appeared to have atoned with a world class save from Kaká from the spot, and yet Kevin Stott ordered a retake when Chara, for some reason, encroached on the area. If ever there was a mascot for 2015 Portland, it isn’t Timber Joey, but rather their morose, scarf-draped coach Caleb Porter looking on from the sidelines. RW A week after starring in a Regency drama over a discarded tissue opposite Portland’s Caleb Porter, Dallas coach Oscar Pareja found himself welcoming 19th-century villain Pablo Mastroeni and his unfeasibly waxed mustache to Toyota Stadium. Pareja must be wishing he’d stayed in the era when his team routinely won games (which going on recent seasons’ evidence we’ll call simply “March”), after his former team’s young players ended a record-equaling winless streak in emphatic fashion by blowing away Dallas in front of their own fans. As we noted last week, time seemed to be running out for Colorado’s kids to come good on their promise as they equalled a decade-old league winless streak record held by Rocky Mountain rivals Real Salt Lake, while still waiting to score their first goal of the season. And with Dallas th hosts after their blip against Portland, most neutrals would have been putting money on the Rapids holding that winless record outright after Friday’s nationally televised game. Instead, after waiting over 600 minutes for a goal, Colorado went ahead with their first of the season after just two minutes, and by the time the final whistle had blown, they’d added three more, with substitute Dillon Serna capping the display with a peach of a goal late on. It was as emphatic as it was unexpected, and in one fell swoop transformed the complexion of Colorado’s start – having kept Dallas out at the other end, the Rapids can now point to having conceded (and lost) in only one of their five games so far, and to have denied the speed and movement of a formidable looking Dallas offense in completing the latest instalment. It would have been no disgrace to concede to this Dallas attack, but having built a defensive platform Mastroeni must have at least hoped for a goal for his team to build on from this game. To score four, unanswered, is a quantum leap for his side, and you have to wonder what effect that can now have on the Rapids’ season, and indeed that of Dallas. Of course seemingly aberrant results can happen at any time in parity-obsessed MLS, but the flip side of that is that there are few easy games for confidence-starved teams to break streaks such as those Colorado have been on (it’s perhaps telling that their last win was against Chivas USA towards the end of that team’s doomed tenure in MLS). To do so against the coach who’d walked out on them must have been an additional pleasure for the Colorado players. That same coach, Pareja, won plaudits last year for the way he retooled his team after what could have been the devastating loss of Mauro Diaz early in the campaign. Compared to that challenge, lifting his team after two consecutive defeats shouldn’t be beyond Pareja, but this has been a week that’s had him reaching for the tissues. GP Why not book the Guardian MLS writing team for your next motivational speaking gig? Not only did we inspire Colorado’s kids to grow up this week, but we took Philadelphia from late game “incompetence” last time out to inspiration this weekend, as the team won their first game of the season through an injury time winner against New York City FC. Fair’s fair and credit may partly be due to the Union themselves, and in particular coach Jim Curtin and his decision to act decisively in dropping expensive goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi this week. Mbolhi had arrived last year being hailed as a coup of a signing by Union CEO Nick Sakiewicz, who had made much of Mbolhi’s appearances at the World Cup, and rather less mention of what’s been a checkered club career. Since arriving, Mbolhi has made a number of high-profile errors, including another awkward one in last week’s loss to Sporting KC, and this week Curtin had seen enough – telling the keeper to basically go home and clear his head with an indefinite timetable for his return. And as Mbolhi took the first flight to France, Curtin turned to local goalkeeper and Union supporter John McCarthy, who had been playing for Rochester Rhinos as Mbolhi appeared in Brazil, to take his place. In the event it wasn’t a complete fairy tale rise for McCarthy, who had to pick the ball out of the net in a strained second-half period for Philadelphia that saw David Villa walk an equalizer into the net, and New York City threaten to roll over their opponents. But a couple of late saves and an otherwise solid enough performance, combined with Vincent Nogueira poking home an injury-time winner at the other end, did mean that McCarthy got to walk off the field with a big hug from Curtin, and in front of home fans celebrating their first win of 2015. It was an important win for Curtin, after the gut punch of Sporting’s two injury-time goals last week, and one that added some extra spice to the return game between the two sides at Yankee Stadium this Thursday night. Certainly it shifted the emphasis of the questions asked of Jason Kreis post-game, as he lamented the late lapse in concentration that saw a long ball being allowed to bounce in the build up to Philly’s winner, but mainly expressed concern at yet another slow start from his team in a second consecutive loss. It’s clearly a preoccupying issue for the emerging New York City team. Visitors to the locker room after the match were greeted by the sight of the pre-game whiteboard emblazoned with the question, “Can we get out to a really aggressive, committed, confident start today?” They didn’t, and the second half flurry that brought the equalizer was not typical of their performance. Maybe they should book the very reasonable Guardian motivational team before Thursday night … GP It’s tempting to compare the Montreal Impact – both Concacaf Champions League finalists and the last-place team in the Eastern Conference following a 3-0 loss to the Houston Dynamo - to other sides which famously excelled in the cups whilst bumbling in the league. Wigan in 2013, able to defeat Manchester City to win the FA Cup but not to stay in the Premier League. Liverpool in 2005, winners of the European Cup and fifth-place finishers in the English top flight, the first to force Uefa to change the rules over Champions League qualifying. Yet the comparisons don’t quite stand up under scrutiny. Despite advancing over two legs in both the CCL quarters and semis against Mexican side Pachuca and Costa Rica’s Alajuelense respectively, in all four matches Frank Klopas’ counterattacking Impact only managed a single, bona fide win: a 2-0 win at the Olympic Stadium in their home semi-final. In fact, that game stands as their only victory in all eight of their eight competitive matches in 2015. The Montreal Impact, despite a historic opportunity to become the first MLS and Canadian team to win the Concacaf Champions League, are nevertheless decidedly mediocre both midweek and weekends. For now, perhaps. Despite conceding three goals to the Dynamo, Montreal were, at least for one or two spells, unmistakably dominant. Andres Romero looked sharp on the ball,­ Dilly Duka was menacing in the early going, Jack McInerney displayed brief glimpses of his old self … Montreal finished the game having outshot, out-passed and out-possessed Owen Coyle’s Dynamo. Houston might say with confidence that letting Montreal have the ball was all part of the plan (Impact defender Laurent Ciman told the press after the match he would have preferred to concede the ball and win than play beautifully and lose). Having conceded in the 15th minute of play, the Impact had no choice in the final stages but to push up and risk a drubbing, which they did courtesy of Ricardo Clark’s nifty run in the box (72nd minute) and the rookie substitute Rob Lovejoy’s wonderful hit (80th). And yet at least the elements of a team perhaps substantially better than the one which finished last overall in 2014 are there. We will get a better picture when the Impact fly to the Azteca for the first leg of the CCL final against America on 22 April.

There's a certain allure I've always found in discovering the great (semi-) unknown film. These discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found \\"High Tide\\" on video at a junk store, mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality. Of course, that's the only place I would find it, as it is still not on DVD. While I was watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the course of this film, I was somehow certain I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and one starring role in \\"A Passage to India\\". But, although she was superb in the aforementioned film, \\"High Tide\\" is a different animal entirely. Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong's later film, \\"Charlotte Gray\\", I was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility. Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I cannot say enough good things about it. She shares an amazing on-screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), this film's other great actress. There's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together, the details of which I won't presume to reveal here (see it for yourself!). There's too much good in \\"High Tide\\" to cover in one review. Indeed, I would hardly care to - the film speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors, and the great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, understated cinematography (please see his work in \\"Tender Mercies\\").

I write this in an attempt to explain it to those who already saw the movie. John (Scott Adkins) seems to wake up from a coma, after 9 months - or so he is told - still freshly remembering how a guy named Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) brutally killed his family. The truth however is that this John is a new clone, with implanted memories of a non-existent family. Obviously, also the killing did never happen. An FBI agent (Rus Blackwell) has some \\"questions\\" for John as soon as he wakes up, showing him a photo of the killer and providing John with a name. The objective of this all is to make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Deveraux is wanted badly by the government because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government and gives them the truth and gives them back their free will by removing any false memories they might have. When John goes out exploring he meets people that he never saw before (obviously, he was just born) but who seem to recognize him. At this point we don't know much of the background story yet, so it's a real mystery when we learn on a few occasions that John apparently can be very violent. First we hear from his ex-girl friend that he once beat a man half-to-death in front of the club where she works (which is why he isn't welcome anymore there), then we meet a guy in some storage building who looks awfully deformed with scares, which apparently is the work of John and reveals that John killed a good friend of himself! At last John finds his former clone, and things become more clear: the previous John had been sent on the same mission - albeit without the false memories about having a family. This John has been freed by Deveraux and worked for him for a while, until he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government and left him.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Domenikos Theotokopoulos (Greek: Domenikos Theotokopoulos [do'minikos theoto'kopulos]; 1541 - 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Domenikos Theotokopoulos (Domenikos Theotokopoulos), often adding the word Kres (Kres, \\"Cretan\\"). El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. In 1577, El Greco migrated to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works. At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city with \\"an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future\\". In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics. During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain. Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernandez de Navarrete, of whose gravedad y decoro (\\"seriousness and decorum\\") the king approved. However, Fernandez died in 1579; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco. Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacon, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned El Espolio. By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including The Trinity and The Assumption of the Virgin. These works would establish the painter's reputation in Toledo. El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had. what did he do in toledo?","completion":"In Toledo, El Greco secured his first large commissions, including a group of paintings that adorned the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the renowned El Espolio.

Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language. Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography. Spanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): When did Valencian regain its offical status?","completion":"Valencian regained its official status after the transition to democracy in Spain in 1978. The Spanish Constitution of 1978, which marked a major turning point in Spain's history and signaled the country's transition from a dictatorship to a democratic constitutional monarchy, recognized and guaranteed the right to use and learn regional languages throughout the Spanish State. Then, the Statute of Autonomy of Valencia, approved in 1982, established Valencian as the official language in the Valencian Community, alongside Spanish. This marked the formal end of the repression of Valencian and began a period of language standardization and normalization, aimed at recovering its use in education, public administration, media, and cultural and social life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Who didn't want the author to pluck grey hairs?

Here is a hypothesis: It lowers the drive to save money for retirement. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. To establish the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the components and analyze them. Premise: Most importantly, it reduces the incentive to save for retirement. This statement indicates that there is a significant factor (referred to as \\"it\\") that has the effect of diminishing the motivation for people to save money towards their retirement. In other words, this specific circumstance or action leads to a decrease in the attractiveness of setting aside financial resources for retirement purposes. Hypothesis: It lowers the drive to save money for retirement. This statement is essentially rephrasing the premise by indicating that the same factor (again, \\"it\\") is causing people to have a reduced desire or motivation to save money for their retirement. The hypothesis directly aligns with the premise – it indicates that the same circumstance or action is responsible for the decreased motivation to save for retirement. To conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, we can analyze the logical structure and coherence between the two statements: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis are focused on the same factor/circumstance (\\"it\\") that impacts savings behavior related to retirement. 2. Both statements share the effect of that factor/circumstance on people's motivation to save for retirement. 3. The rephrasing of the premise in the hypothesis uses slightly different terminology but maintains the same overall meaning - reducing the incentive to save for retirement equates to lowering the drive to save money for retirement. Based on these factors, we can establish that if the premise is valid and accurate, so is the hypothesis. The statements share a consistent focus on the specific effect of the factor in question (reducing motivation to save for retirement), and the logical coherence in their structure supports the validity of the hypothesis when the premise is true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: It's the end of the line for Roadrunner, a first-of-its-kind collection of processors that once reigned as the world's fastest supercomputer. This undated handout photo provided by IBM shows lead engineer Don Grice of IBM inspecting the world's fastest computer, nicknamed \\"Roadrunner\\", in the company's Poughkeepsie, N.Y. plant. It's the end... (Associated Press) The 121 million supercomputer, housed at one of the premier U.S. nuclear weapons research laboratories in northern New Mexico, will be decommissioned Sunday. The reason? The world of supercomputing is evolving and Roadrunner has been replaced with something smaller, faster, more energy efficient and cheaper. Still, officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say it's among the 25 fastest supercomputers in the world. \\"Roadrunner got everyone thinking in new ways about how to build and use a supercomputer,\\" said Gary Grider, who works in the lab's high performance computing division. \\"Specialized processors are being included in new ways on new systems and being used in novel ways. Our demonstration with Roadrunner caused everyone to pay attention.\\" In 2008, Roadrunner was first to break the elusive petaflop barrier by processing just over a quadrillion mathematical calculations per second. Los Alamos teamed up with IBM to build Roadrunner from commercially available parts. They ended up with 278 refrigerator-size racks filled with two different types of processors, all linked together by 55 miles (89 kilometers) of fiber optic cable. It took nearly two dozen tractor trailer trucks to deliver the supercomputer from New York to northern New Mexico. The supercomputer has been used over the last five years to model viruses and unseen parts of the universe, to better understand lasers and for nuclear weapons work. That includes simulations aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of the aging U.S. arsenal. As part of the U.S. nuclear stockpile stewardship program, researchers used Roadrunner's high-speed calculation capabilities to unravel some of the mysteries of energy flow in weapons. Los Alamos has been helping pioneer novel computer systems for decades. In 1976, the lab helped with the development of the Cray-1. In 1993, the lab held the fastest supercomputer title with the Thinking Machine CM-5. \\"And to think of where we're going to be in the next 10 to 15 years, it's just mindboggling,\\" said lab spokesman Kevin Roark. Right now, Los Alamos _ along with scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California _ is using a supercomputer dubbed Cielo. Installed in 2010, it's slightly faster than Roadrunner, takes up less space and came in at just under 54 million. Roark said in the next 10 to 20 years, it's expected that the world's supercomputers will be capable of breaking the exascale barrier, or one quintillion calculations per second. There will be no ceremony when Roadrunner is switched off Sunday, but lab officials said researchers will spend the next month experimenting with its operating system and techniques for compressing memory before dismantling begins. They say the work could help guide the design of future supercomputers. ___ Follow Susan Montoya Bryan on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/susanmbryanNM ||||| Created to monitor the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, the IBM supercomputer was the first to break the petaflop barrier. The Roadrunner supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. (Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Four years ago, Roadrunner was the world's fastest supercomputer. But it has lost a step on today's speed leaders and will be shut down today in preparation for dismantling. Created in 2008 to monitor the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, the IBM supercomputer was the first system to break the petaflop barrier, hitting 1.026 petaflops shortly after its installation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. (1 petaflop is equal to a quadrillion, or one thousand trillion, calculations per second.) It would ultimately sit atop of the Top500 supercomputers list three times. In its five years of operation, the Roadrunner was the \\"workhorse\\" behind the National Nuclear Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing program, providing key computer simulations for the Stockpile Stewardship Program. \\"Roadrunner exemplified stockpile stewardship: an excellent team integrating complex codes with advanced computing architectures to ensure a safe, secure and effective deterrent,\\" Chris Deeney, NNSA assistant deputy administrator for Stockpile Stewardship, said in a statement. \\"Roadrunner and its successes have positioned us well to weather the technology changes on the HPC horizon as we implement stockpile modernization without recourse to underground testing.\\" Based on the IBM QS22 blades and x86 chips from Advanced Micro Devices, the 121 million Roadrunner was the world's first hybrid supercomputer. In total, Roadrunner took up 278 refrigerator-size server racks, connecting 6,562 dual-core AMD Opteron and 12,240 Cell chips -- advanced versions of the same processor that powers Sony's PlayStation 3. \\"Roadrunner was a truly pioneering idea,\\" Gary Grider, of the Laboratory's High Performance Computing Division, said in a statement. \\"Roadrunner got everyone thinking in new ways about how to build and use a supercomputer. Specialized processors are being included in new ways on new systems, and being used in novel ways. Our demonstration with Roadrunner caused everyone to pay attention.\\" While Roadrunner is still one of the world's 30 fastest supercomputers, advances in chip design have left it behind. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Titan supercomputer is currently the speed leader, clocking in at 17.59 petaflops per second. Built by Cray, the system is composed of 18,688 nodes, with each containing a 16-core AMD Opteron processor and an Nvidia Tesla GPU. In addition to Roadrunner's weapons-monitoring duties, it also helped map the HIV genetic tree and simulated the Big Bang in an attempt to better understand dark matter, calculating the physics behind 64 billion proto-galaxies, each about the size of a billion of our suns. Before Roadrunner is dismantled, researchers will have about a month to perform experiments on the operating system's memory compression techniques to aid design of future supercomputers. \\"Even in death, we are trying to learn from Roadrunner,\\" Grider said. \\"These are things we never could try while Roadrunner was running production problems.\\" ||||| Five years ago, an IBM-built supercomputer designed to model the decay of the US nuclear weapons arsenal was clocked at speeds no computer in the history of Earth had ever reached. At more than one quadrillion floating point operations per second (that's a million billion, or a \\"petaflop\\"), the aptly named Roadrunner was so far ahead of the competition that it earned the #1 slot on the Top 500 supercomputer list in June 2008, November 2008, and one last time in June 2009. Today, that computer has been declared obsolete and it's being taken offline. Based at the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, Roadrunner will be studied for a while and then ultimately dismantled. While the computer is still one of the 22 fastest in the world, it isn't energy-efficient enough to make the power bill worth it. \\"During its five operational years, Roadrunner, part of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program to provide key computer simulations for the Stockpile Stewardship Program, was a workhorse system providing computing power for stewardship of the US nuclear deterrent, and in its early shakedown phase, a wide variety of unclassified science,\\" Los Alamos lab said in an announcement Friday. Costing more than 120 million, Roadrunner's 296 server racks covering 6,000 square feet were connected with InfiniBand and contained 122,400 processor cores. The hybrid architecture used IBM PowerXCell 8i CPUs (an enhanced version of the Sony PlayStation 3 processor) and AMD Opteron dual-core processors. The AMD processors handled basic tasks, with the Cell CPUs \\"taking on the most computationally intense parts of a calculation—thus acting as a computational accelerator,\\" Los Alamos wrote. \\"Although other hybrid computers existed, none were at the supercomputing scale,\\" Los Alamos said. \\"Many doubted that a hybrid supercomputer could work, so for Los Alamos and IBM, Roadrunner was a leap of faith… As part of its Stockpile Stewardship work, Roadrunner took on a difficult, long-standing gap in understanding of energy flow in a weapon and its relation to weapon yield.\\" Roadrunner lost its world's-fastest title in November 2009 to Jaguar, another Department of Energy supercomputer combining AMD Opterons with Cray processors. Jaguar hit 1.76 petaflops to take the title, and it still exists as part of an even newer cluster called Titan. Titan took the top spot in the November 2012 supercomputers list with a speed of 17.6 petaflops. Supercomputing researchers are now looking toward exascale speeds—1,000 times faster than a petaflop—but major advances in energy efficiency and price-performance are necessary. Petaflop machines aren't automatically obsolete—a petaflop is still speedy enough to crack the top 25 fastest supercomputers. Roadrunner is thus still capable of performing scientific work at mind-boggling speeds, but has been surpassed by competitors in terms of energy efficiency. For example, in the November 2012 ratings Roadrunner required 2,345 kilowatts to hit 1.042 petaflops and a world ranking of #22. The supercomputer at #21 required only 1,177 kilowatts, and #23 (clocked at 1.035 petaflops) required just 493 kilowatts. \\"Future supercomputers will need to improve on Roadrunner’s energy efficiency to make the power bill affordable,\\" Los Alamos wrote. \\"Future supercomputers will also need new solutions for handling and storing the vast amounts of data involved in such massive calculations.\\" After Roadrunner is shut off today, researchers will spend a month doing experiments on \\"operating system memory compression techniques for an ASC relevant application, and optimized data routing to help guide the design of future capacity cluster computers.\\" After that, the cluster will finally be dismantled, the end of the world's first petaflop supercomputer. |||||Summary:","completion":"Roadrunner was a very special computer called a supercomputer, which was very fast and powerful. It was built to help do important work like studying how to keep people safe from nuclear weapons. Roadrunner used to be the fastest supercomputer in the world, but now there are other, faster ones.

What is the answer for the question: What number did the song that was the first completed for Blonde on Blonde reach on the UK charts? from the following article ? \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\"When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde's first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: \\"I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad.

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\"?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John Owen Brennan (born September 22, 1955) was the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from March 2013 to January 2017. He served as chief counterterrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama; his title was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to the President. His responsibilities included overseeing plans to protect the country from terrorism and respond to natural disasters, and he met with the President daily. Previously, he advised President Obama on foreign policy and intelligence issues during the 2008 presidential campaign and transition. Brennan began his CIA career as an analyst and spent 25 years with the agency. He was a daily intelligence briefer for President Bill Clinton. In 1996, he was CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia when the Khobar Towers bombing killed 19 U.S. servicemen. In 1999, he was appointed chief of staff to George Tenet, then-Director of the CIA. Brennan became deputy executive director of the CIA in March 2001. He was director of the newly created Terrorist Threat Integration Center from 2003 to 2004, an office that sifted through and compiled information for President Bush's daily top secret intelligence briefings and employed the services of analysts from a dozen U.S. agencies and entities. One of the controversies in his career involves the distribution of intelligence to the Bush White House that helped lead to an \\"Orange Terror Alert\\", in late 2003. The intelligence, which purported to list terror targets, was highly controversial within the CIA and was later discredited. An Obama administration official does not dispute that Brennan distributed the intelligence during the Bush era but said Brennan passed it along because that was his job. His last post within the Intelligence Community was as director of the National Counterterrorism Center in 2004 and 2005, which incorporated information on terrorist activities across U.S. agencies. Brennan then left government service for a few years, becoming Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) and the CEO of The Analysis Corporation (TAC). He continued to lead TAC after its acquisition by Global Strategies Group in 2007 and its growth as the Global Intelligence Solutions division of Global's North American technology business GTEC, before returning to government service with the Obama administration as Homeland Security Advisor on January 20, 2009. On January 7, 2013, Brennan was nominated by President Barack Obama to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In September 2017, Brennan was named a Distinguished Non-Resident Scholar at The University of Texas at Austin, where he also acts as a Senior Advisor to the University's Intelligence Studies Project. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article about John Owen Brennan: 1. Impressive career at the CIA: Brennan has spent 25 years with the CIA, holding various positions, including daily intelligence briefer for President Bill Clinton, CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the Khobar Towers bombing, and chief of staff to George Tenet, then-Director of the CIA. 2. Terrorist Threat Integration Center: Brennan was the director of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center from 2003 to 2004.

'Orange Terror Alert' controversy: One of the controversies in Brennan's career involves distributing intelligence information that led to an \\"Orange Terror Alert\\" in 2003. The intelligence, which claimed to list terror targets, turned out to be highly controversial and eventually discredited. However, an Obama administration official defended Brennan's actions, stating that he passed on the intelligence because it was part of his job. 4. Post-CIA career and return to government: After leaving the Intelligence Community, Brennan became Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) and CEO of The Analysis Corporation (TAC). Brennan continued to lead TAC after its acquisition by Global Strategies Group in 2007 before returning to government service with the Obama administration as Homeland Security Advisor on January 20, 2009. 5.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Question: What is the name of the person whose orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade, according to McVeagh? Answer the above question based on the context below: Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Here is a news article: Back fire: TomTom sold user data to police, motorists then targeted with speed traps Following reports that TomTom had sold traffic data collected from GPS device users to police who then used it to determine locations for speed traps, the company has issued a statement and video in an effort to appease angry customers. In the video, TomTom CEO Harold Goodijn stresses that the tracking of its devices is voluntary and that customers can choose not to allow it. He also says the data is provided anonymously, and is valuable information the company uses to improve the guidance of its devices, by identifying problem areas and routing customers around them. TomTom says the company has provided this data to police departments and other authorities to help them identify congested areas for safety reasons and to help determine where road capacity needs to be increased. Mr. Goodijn says TomTom had been unaware Dutch police were using the data to choose locations for speed traps and that the company would prevent that type of usage in the future. With revenue from standalone GPS devices falling as more motorists turn to their smart phones for navigation, it is not surprising that TomTom is looking for other sources of income. And traffic information that might help identify overloaded roads, danger spots, and help prevent crashes can hardly be looked at as anything but a good thing, particularly if lives are saved--so long as privacy is protected. Whether it is a good or bad thing to use that data as a tool to capture speeders who may well be endangering other motorists is an interesting question. Is TomTom serving its customers, community safety, or its business demands. Can all three be addressed fairly? What do you think? ||||| AFP/Getty Images Dutch police used TomTom data to locate speed traps The use by police of navigation equipment maker TomTom NV’s data to site road speed cameras looks to have been limited to the Netherlands, but the company still has to lay out more clearly how it protects the privacy of its customers, Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said. Last week, it emerged that police in certain Dutch provinces used data collected by TomTom to better plan where to locate speed traps, causing an outcry in the country and forcing Mr. Goddijn to apologize in e-mails to its customers and in full-page advertisements in Dutch newspapers. The company can’t guarantee “a hundred percent” that the issue was limited to its home market of the Netherlands, but there is no indication right now that it occurred in other countries, Mr. Goddijn told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Monday. Meanwhile, the company’s customers appreciated its “open communication” over the issue and doesn’t expect its reputation to be harmed, Mr. Goddijn said. TomTom collects anonymous data from owners of high-end navigation devices and those on Vodafone’s local network to provide information about individual driving behavior, which it then uses to power real-time information services for its customers, including the location of speed cameras. TomTom also sells the data, which includes speed profiles, to governments throughout Europe as well as the U.S. and Canada. The province of Ontario, for example, used TomTom data to refine the evacuation plan for the city of Toronto. When it emerged that Dutch police were making use of the data to position speed cameras more efficiently “it was a sobering experience,” Mr. Goddijn said, adding that TomTom has more work to do to explain how it protects customers’ privacy. “We fully comply with strict privacy laws” Still, the issue was “unjustifiably linked to other data scandals,” he said. “From a strictly legal standpoint we didn’t make a mistake, as we fully comply with strict privacy laws.” Consumers are becoming increasingly sensitive to how companies use their personal data; Apple just last week, responding to mounting criticism and concern over privacy, denied claims that it tracks its iPhone users but acknowledged flaws in how it collects and stores data required for location-based services. Google’s Street View, which allows users to virtually tour locations on a map, has also sparked intense debate about privacy across Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere. In the Netherlands, TomTom sold its data to a third party company which resold it to the Dutch government, from where it finally ended up in the hands of provincial and local policy authorities, Mr. Goddijn said. Mr. Goddijn declined to say how much money TomTom makes from selling data to governments. “The amount is not huge but meaningful,” he said. As a result of the furore, TomTom is working to amend its license agreements to ban police from using its data, a time-consuming task that means the company has to review every existing contract. For new contracts with governments, rules that bar police from using TomTom’s speed profiles will come into effect within the next two weeks, Mr. Goddijn said. TomTom uses the data it collects to create real-time information services it sells to its customers—including information about the location of speed cameras. An annual subscription costs €50 in the Netherlands but pricing varies from country to country. Such added-value, high-margin services are becoming increasingly important for TomTom which last week lowered its full year sales outlook as the market for personal navigation devices continues to shrink. Personal navigation systems, or PNDs, are still TomTom’s core product, generating slightly less than 50% of its overall revenue. Last week Mr. Goddijn told Dow Jones Newswires he sees growing potential for new services and doesn’t expect sales to be hurt by the recent controversy.

Their personnel changed and rotated with each album and tour. - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify. - \\"The Humpty Dance\\" is a song by Digital Underground, which was featured on their debut album \\"Sex Packets\\". The single climbed to #11 on the pop charts, #7 on the R&B charts, and #1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart.

The song has been sampled by many different artists and producers. In the song's video, a young Tupac Shakur is visible in the background. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\" - 2Pacalypse Now is the debut studio album by American rapper 2Pac. It was released on November 12, 1991, by Interscope Records and EastWest Records America.

Their albums contained cameos by many of the Digital Underground crew, including Shock G (as himself, Humpty Hump, and the Piano Man) and 2Pac. The group gave a more raw, hardcore feel than the funky styles that typical Digital Underground albums projected, pulling away from their Funkadelic and Parliament roots. Tracks put out under the Raw Fusion name tended to be more experiemntal and had less of the flow that was typically found in other tracks to which Money-B and DJ Fuze had contributed. The group released two albums before disbanding. - An alter ego (Latin, \\"the other I\\") is a second self, which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or original personality.

The Raiders took advantage and moved the ball down the field before Carr hit Michael Crabtree from 23 yards out to give the Raiders a 7-0 lead. Neither team could muster much offense until midway through the second quarter when the Chargers moved 82 yards and scored on a Melvin Gordon touchdown run from one yard out to tie the game.

The Chargers finally managed some offense as Philip Rivers hit Melvin Gordon for a six-yard touchdown pass to give the Charger at 14-10 lead. On their ensuing possession, Cordarrelle Patterson took the ball on an end around and scampered 47 yards for a touchdown. Giorgio Tavecchio would, however, miss the ensuing point after to leave the Raider lead at two points, 16-14. After exchanging punts, the Chargers took over with 4:09 remaining in the game. Rivers hit Hunter Henry for a 23-yard pass play to move the ball into Raider territory. with less than two minutes remaining, the Chargers moved the ball to the Raider 10 yard line and lined up for the game-winning field goal with three second left in the game. The field goal was good and the Raiders suffered their fourth straight loss, falling to 2-4 on the season. The four losses through six gamed equaled the number of losses they suffered the entire season the prior year. The Raider defense again struggled, giving up 343 total yards while the offense struggled as well, managing only 274 yards. Carr's two interceptions proved costly in his return. After the game, the team said his poor play was not due to his injury. Question: Who is the Raiders field goal kicker? Student:","completion":"To solve this task, I will follow these steps: 1.

Choose your answer from: * no. * yes.","completion":"No, these two questions do not share the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why not to fear?\\" seems to be asking about the concepts or reasons for not being afraid in general. Fear is an emotional response to perceived threats and can sometimes be useful as it helps protect us from danger. However, it can also be irrational or unhelpful, and this question might be exploring ways to manage or overcome excessive fear. The second question, \\"Why do you fear animals?\\" deals more specifically with fear towards animals. People may experience fear of animals for different reasons, such as a fear of being harmed, bitten, or attacked. This might be spurred by past experiences, cultural beliefs, or simply a lack of understanding or exposure to animals. Here the focus is on the fear towards a particular group, which is different from discussing fear in general. So, while both questions explore the topic of fear, they approach it from distinct angles and inquire about different aspects. Thus, the appropriate answer is \\"no,\\" as they do not share the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These fungi are called dimorphic fungi , because they have “two forms.” For example, the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum , which causes the disease histoplasmosis, is thermally dimorphic; it has two forms that are dependent on temperature. In temperatures of about 25°C, it grows as a brownish mycelium, and looks like a mass of threads. At body temperature (37°C in humans), it grows as single, round yeast cells.

Charles II granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. Because the northern half of the colony differed significantly from the southern half, and because transportation and communication between the two settled regions was difficult, a separate deputy governor was named to administer the northern half of the colony starting in 1691. The division of the colony into North and South was completed at a meeting of the Lords Proprietors held at Craven House in London on December 7, 1710, although the same proprietors continued to control both colonies. The first Governor of the separate North Carolina Province was Edward Hyde. Unrest against the proprietors in South Carolina in 1719 led to the appointment of a royal governor in that colony by King George I, whereas the Lords Proprietor continued to appoint the governor of North Carolina.

The main living area is spacious and is large enough to sleep a huge party of girls. The comfy couches serve as beds while the staff offers rollaways just in case your girls aren't intoxicated enough to knock out on the floor. We even had a lil gym room that sported an elliptical machine. It served itself as a glorified towel rack. At one point, we had three blowdryers going which in turn ended up shorting the circuits, rendering all our hair gadgets useless. Sigh. Luckily, the other room which was attached to our suite had functioning outlets. Anyway, the room deco struck me odd. I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but it didn't hold as much of a modern value as I would have liked. I did, however, really love the bathroom.

The reviewer found the hotel to be beautiful and appreciated its location adjacent to the Venetian. They were pleased with the variety of food and restaurant options which contributed to their positive rating.

The reviewer also highlights the spaciousness of the suite and its ability to accommodate a large group of people comfortably. The availability of rollaway beds and the fact that the staff was willing to provide them shows that the hotel caters to its guests' needs. The presence of a small gym room, albeit used as a towel rack, demonstrates additional amenities that the hotel offers. However, there are also some criticisms and disappointments expressed in the review. The incident with the malfunctioning outlets caused by using multiple hairdryers highlights some electrical issues that had an impact on their experience. Additionally, the reviewer was not entirely impressed with the room's décor, hoping for a more modern touch. These shortcomings contributed to the 3.5-star rating as opposed to a perfect score. Despite these downsides, the reviewer enjoyed the bathroom and found it to be the best part of the suite. They also mentioned their first night was in a smaller suite but still had enough space for 9 people, demonstrating that the hotel offers various accommodations suitable for different group sizes.

The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown.

Read this: In 2006, FIG introduced a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the \\"execution score\\" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.

Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN)Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko declared a ceasefire went into effect at midnight Saturday local time (5 p.m. ET) between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian militants in the nation's east. The separatist Donetsk People's Republic also announced the ceasefire. But an apparent violation was reported less than 90 minutes after the ceasefire began when Ukraine's Anti-Terrorist Operation Command reported that a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region has been shelled by mortars. As a positive sign, CNN reporters in Ukraine reported the shelling quieted shortly after midnight. The peace agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus, several days ago comes with many questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick. Mistrust is high on both sides, adding to the doubts. The town of Debaltseve, a strategically located railroad hub in the east, is shaping up as a crucial piece of the ceasefire. In his speech announcing the ceasefire, Poroshenko said Ukrainian troops control the town and warned militants to stay away. \\"I think the fact of using the tense situation on the outskirts of Debaltseve by militants-terrorists-mercenaries poses a great threat, which can violate the ceasefire regime,\\" Poroshenko said. \\"I am warning all participants of the Minsk negotiations, including the Russian Federation, which identifies itself as the guarantor of the reached agreements.\\" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, reporting from the eastern town of Donetsk, said separatists claim to have encircled Debaltseve. \\"Debaltseve will be a vital flashpoint for the hours ahead,\\" he said.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor.

Some people communicate easily with strangers, others need to talk with members of their own groups. A religion is a type of group. What do members of a religion have in common? - believe in god - talk to each other - pay bills - learn from each other - believe in ghosts The best answer is Answer:","completion":"Members of a religion have several commonalities that unite them as a group, and this shared understanding and belief system allows them to communicate effectively with one another. The best answer that encompasses the primary elements of what they have in common would be that they share beliefs in a higher power or divine entity, engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community, learn from each other, and often participate in financial support for their religious institutions. 1. Believe in a higher power or divine entity: Members of a religion typically share a belief in a higher power, whether it is a single god, multiple gods, or a divine presence that governs the universe and the lives of people. This belief in a higher power or divine entity is the foundation of their religious identity. 2. Engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community: Religion often emphasizes the importance of community, fellowship, and interaction among its members. By engaging in conversations and activities together, members of a religious group can foster strong connections and understanding, which in turn leads to effective communication. 3. Learn from each other: As members of a religious community, individuals often learn from one another through the sharing of teachings, experiences, and wisdom. This exchange of knowledge and understanding helps to strengthen their shared beliefs and practices, further solidifying the group's cohesion. 4. Participate in financial support for their religious institutions: Members of a religion often contribute financially to their religious institutions, supporting the maintenance of places of worship, organization of religious activities, and payment of religious leaders. This shared responsibility fosters a sense of belonging and commitment to the group and its beliefs. Although \\"believe in ghosts\\" may apply to some religious groups, it does not necessarily encompass all religions, nor is it a central aspect of religious identity, making it less relevant to the core commonalities among members of a religious community. In summary, members of a religion have a shared belief in a higher power or divine entity, engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community, learn from each other, and participate in financial support for their religious institutions. These commonalities serve as the basis for effective communication and a strong sense of group identity within the religious community."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Write an article with the title: \\"BBC Broadcasting House extension - review\\"","completion":"Title: BBC Broadcasting House Extension - Review Step 1: Begin with an introductory paragraph about the BBC and the significance of the Broadcasting House extension The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has been a cornerstone of British culture since its establishment in 1922. As a public service broadcaster, it strives to inform, educate, and entertain a global audience. In line with its continuing growth and commitment to maintaining its status as a world-class media organization, the BBC has undertaken an extension project for its iconic Broadcasting House. This review will delve into the details of this ambitious and impressive project, assessing its impact on the organization, its staff, and the surrounding community. Step 2: Provide an overview of the Broadcasting House extension project The Broadcasting House extension, officially known as the W1 Programme, was initiated in 2003 with the goal of consolidating the majority of BBC’s offices and operations in a single, versatile and cutting-edge facility. The project involved the renovation of the original Broadcasting House, as well as the construction of a new extension building, known as the Peel Wing. Overall, the extension has added a staggering 80,000 square meters of space, allowing the BBC to optimize its functioning and respond more effectively to the demands of 21st-century broadcasting. Step 3: Discuss the architecture and design of the extension Designed by the renowned British architectural firm, MJP Architects, the Broadcasting House extension skillfully blends the old and the new. While the original Art Deco façade has been preserved, the new Peel Wing boasts a contemporary, sleek, and energy-efficient design. The glass and steel facade not only makes a visual impact but also cleverly symbolizes the transparency and openness the BBC is known for. The extension also includes a public piazza, further promoting community engagement and allowing visitors and staff alike to appreciate this architectural triumph. Step 4: Analyze the impact on operations and the working environment The consolidation of departments and teams into the extended Broadcasting House has resulted in improved collaboration and communication within the organization. Journalists, production teams, and support staff enjoy state-of-the-art facilities, which allow them to develop and deliver high-quality content more effectively. Moreover, the new environment has facilitated the sharing of ideas and information, fostering innovation and creativity. The numerous sustainable features of the building, such as green roofs and energy-efficient systems, demonstrate the BBC's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and promoting sustainable practices. Step 5: Examine the public's reaction and the extension's impact on the local community The BBC Broadcasting House extension has been well-received by the public and critics alike. Its striking design and architectural ingenuity have garnered praise and positioned it as a landmark in London’s Fitzrovia district. The incorporation of public spaces and the creation of the piazza have revitalized the local community and increased its appeal as a must-visit destination for both tourists and Londoners alike. Additionally, the project has spurred economic growth in the area, as new businesses have opened to accommodate the influx of visitors and staff. Step 6: Conclude the review In conclusion, the BBC Broadcasting House extension stands as a testament to the enduring relevance and dynamism of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The project represents a successful marriage of heritage, architectural innovation, and a forward-looking approach to modern media operations. It serves not just as a hub for the production of world-class content, but also as a symbol of the BBC’s dedication to serving its audience and remaining a trusted source of news, entertainment, and education for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How much you look back and realize what you were given . Growing up , I was never given what I wanted . I got some of what I wanted from my parents . What may be the reason for not getting what you want ?","completion":"There may be various reasons for not getting what you want in life, especially in the context described in the text. It is important to remember that multiple factors could contribute to this situation, depending on individual circumstances. Some of the possible reasons are: 1. Parental Priorities: The priorities of one's parents may have differed from their child's desires. In some cases, parents may value the importance of necessities like education, clothing, and shelter over materialistic or leisure-related wants. As a result, they might primarily focus on providing what they believe is essential for their child's future well-being. 2. Financial Constraints: Financial constraints or budget limitations might have played a significant role in not getting what one wants. Parents might have been unable to provide everything desired due to financial limitations at a particular point in time. Prioritizing expenses on more pressing needs, like healthcare or basic sustenance, could lead to some wants being unfulfilled. 3. Lessons in Impracticality: Parents might intentionally not provide everything their child wants to teach valuable life lessons, including understanding the difference between 'wants' and 'needs,' learning gratitude, and developing a strong sense of self-reliance. This approach aims to prepare children to face life's challenges and understand that they might not always get what they desire. 4. Developing Resilience: Life is full of obstacles and disappointments, and not always getting what one wants can help build resilience. By denying certain things, parents may hope to help their child cultivate adaptability and perseverance, enabling them to deal with unexpected situations and setbacks more effectively in the future. 5. Encouraging Appreciation: Refraining from fulfilling every want might encourage children to develop a sense of appreciation for what they have. By learning the value of what they already possess, children are more likely to be content in their lives, avoiding the pitfalls of perpetual dissatisfaction and materialism. 6. Instilling the Importance of Hard Work: Not always receiving what one desires might also serve as motivation to work harder for personal achievements. Parents may withhold certain wants as an incentive for their child to put in the effort and pursue opportunities on their own, fostering a strong work ethic and determination to succeed. 7. Societal Limits and Expectations: In some instances, societal norms and expectations may have played a role in not fulfilling all of a child's wants. For example, a parent might have been reluctant to allow their child to engage in certain behaviors or activities deemed socially unacceptable or not in line with traditional values. In conclusion, there may be numerous reasons for not getting what you want in life, particularly during childhood. These reasons often stem from parental decisions and circumstances, such as financial constraints, teaching valuable life lessons, or maintaining societal norms. Understanding and accepting these factors can help individuals reflect on their growth and form realistic expectations of life, leading to personal growth and a greater sense of satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will Carson want to do next? The answer is:","completion":"Carson, after reading Jan's letter, experiences a rush of emotions, primarily anger and frustration. The content of the letter must have deeply affected Carson, triggering the need for an immediate conversation with Jan. Consequently, there are several steps that Carson will most likely want to take in order to address the situation: 1. Take a moment to calm down: Before approaching Jan, it's essential that Carson processes their immediate emotional reaction. This could involve taking deep breaths, going for a walk, or allowing some time to pass for the initial anger to subside. A calm and level-headed mindset would enable a more productive discussion and prevent impulsive decisions. 2. Reflect on the contents of the letter: Once Carson is calmer, they should re-read the letter to gain a thorough understanding of what exactly upset them. It's also important for Carson to consider Jan's point of view and ask themselves why Jan might have written those words. By understanding both perspectives, Carson can ensure a balanced and fair conversation. 3. Prepare for the conversation: Carson should write a list of points they want to address. This will help organize their thoughts and provide a clear structure for the conversation. Carson should be prepared to express how the letter made them feel, highlight specific areas of concern, and propose potential resolutions. 4. Arrange a meeting with Jan: Once the preparation is complete, Carson must decide on the most appropriate way to confront Jan. It could be through a face-to-face conversation, a phone call, or even a video call. Depending on the nature of their relationship, Carson ought to choose a mode of communication that feels most comfortable but also ensures an honest and open discussion. 5. Maintain a respectful and open-minded approach: During the conversation, Carson should remain respectful, listening actively to Jan's point of view, and avoiding blame or accusations. They should communicate their feelings and concerns assertively without resorting to aggressive language or dismissing Jan's perspective. Both parties should be open to finding common ground and working towards a resolution. 6. Reach a resolution or set a plan for moving forward: At the end of the conversation, Carson and Jan will ideally have either resolved their issue or developed a plan for moving forward. This could involve an apology, a commitment to better communication, or a follow-up conversation to check in on progress. 7. Reflect on the experience: Finally, Carson should take some time to reflect on the situation, assess whether the conversation was productive, and consider any personal growth or insights that may have emerged from the confrontation. This self-reflection can help Carson in future similar circumstances and contribute to the overall personal development. In conclusion, Carson's next step would be to calm down, carefully reflect on the contents of the letter and their feelings, and approach Jan with a well-structured conversation. By doing so, Carson can effectively address the situation, maintain a respectful and open-minded approach, and work towards a possible resolution of the conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. By the time the break began, Stump was the heaviest he had ever been and loathed the band's image as an \\"emo\\" band. Coming home from tour, drummer Andy Hurley \\"went through the darkest depression [I've] ever felt. I looked at my calendar and it was just empty.\\" Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. \\"I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day\\", Wentz recalled. Previously known as the \\"overexposed, despised\\" leader of the band, Wentz \\"simply grew up\\", sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: \\"There was a jump-cut in my life. I started thinking - like, being old would be cool.\\" During the hiatus, the band members each pursued individual musical interests, which were met with \\"varying degrees of failure\\". Stump was the only member of the quartet to take on a solo project while Fall Out Boy was on hiatus, recording debut album Soul Punk entirely on his own: he wrote, produced, and played every instrument for all tracks on the record. In addition, he married his longtime girlfriend and lost over sixty pounds through portion control and exercise. Stump blew through most of his savings putting together a large band to tour behind Soul Punk, but ticket sales were sparse and the album stalled commercially. During a particularly dark moment in February 2012, Stump poured his heart out in a 1500-word blog entry called \\"We Liked You Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah\\". In the post, Stump lamented the harsh reception of the record and his status as a \\"has-been\\" at 27. Stump revealed that fans harassed him on his solo tour, hurling insults such as \\"We liked you better fat\\", and noted that \\"Whatever notoriety Fall Out Boy used to have prevents me from having the ability to start over from the bottom again.\\" Aside from Soul Punk and personal developments, Stump moonlighted as a professional songwriter/producer, co-writing tracks with Bruno Mars and All Time Low, and pursued acting. Wentz formed electronic duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The project released one single before album delays led to Rexha's departure in 2011. Black Cards added Spencer Peterson to complete the Use Your Disillusion EP in 2012. Wentz also completed writing a novel, Gray, that he had been working on for six years outside the band, and began hosting the reality tattoo competition show Best Ink. Hurley ventured farther into rock during the hiatus, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He continued to manage his record label, Fuck City, and drummed for bands Burning Empires and Enabler. He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. Despite this, the members all remained cordial to one another; Wentz was Stump's best man at his wedding. The hiatus was, all things considered, beneficial for the group and its members, according to Hurley. \\"The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out\\", he explained in 2013. \\"Especially Joe and Patrick, who were so young. And Pete is a million times better.\\" Why did they take a hiatus?","completion":"Fall Out Boy took a hiatus due to several reasons, largely stemming from personal struggles and a desire to explore individual interests. At the time, lead vocalist Patrick Stump was struggling with his weight and the band's emo image, while drummer Andy Hurley was battling severe depression. Bassist Pete Wentz, who had been abusing prescription medications, went through a divorce and returned to therapy. During this hiatus, each band member pursued their own projects, albeit with varying degrees of success. Patrick Stump worked on a solo album, Soul Punk, and underwent significant personal transformation. Pete Wentz started an electronic duo project, Black Cards, and wrote a novel titled Gray. Andy Hurley explored different rock projects, managing his record label and drumming for several bands. Joe Trohman formed a new heavy metal band, The Damned Things, with Hurley and members of Anthrax and Every Time I Die. As stated by Hurley in 2013, \\"The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out\\", explaining the break as ultimately beneficial for both the group and its members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: One seeks to make a movie costume for a baby. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"When we want to make a movie costume for a baby, we have two options: 1. Make a costume from scratch: This means we will create the costume ourselves using things like fabric, scissors, and sewing tools. We will pick a design from a movie and try to make it for the baby. 2. Buy a ready-made costume: This means we go to a store or online to buy a costume that is already made to look like a movie character. All we have to do is put it on the baby. To decide which method is more reasonable, we can think about a few things: - Time: If we don't have much time, it might be better to buy a ready-made costume, because making one from scratch can take a lot of time. - Skills: If we are good at sewing and making things, we can try making the costume from scratch. If not, buying a ready-made costume might be easier. - Personal preference: Some people enjoy making things, while others prefer buying them. Depending on what we like, we can choose one method or the other. - Budget: If we want to save money, we may be able to make the costume from scratch using materials we already have. On the other hand, some ready-made costumes can also be affordable. So, the best method really depends on what is most important to us and what we feel most comfortable doing. If we don't mind spending some money and want something quick, buying a costume might be more reasonable. But if we want to have fun making it and possibly save money, then making the costume from scratch could be the way to go."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Extremely Disappointing Experience Review: I rarely take the time to write reviews, but my experience with the com.fsck.k9 app was so poor that I felt compelled to share my thoughts. I downloaded this app with high hopes, but it promptly failed to live up to my expectations. Here's a detailed breakdown of my 1-star rating: 1. User Interface: The interface is clunky and unattractive, making the app difficult to navigate. It seems like the design hasn't been updated in years, and it falls extremely short of the polished and modern look that I've come to expect from apps on my phone. 2. Performance: The app is sluggish and consistently crashes, even when performing the simplest of tasks. It's frustratingly slow and has rendered my email management borderline unmanageable. I've tried reinstalling and updating several times, but the problems persist. 3. Notifications: I've had countless instances in which the app has failed to notify me of important emails - some even time-sensitive. On the flip side, the app has also been sending me duplicate notifications for the same email, which is just as annoying. 4. Features: Although this app claims to have a wide range of features, I've found that many of them either don't work or are too difficult to set up due to the convoluted interface. The feature set is far from comprehensive, and I find it lacking in comparison to other email apps I've tried. 5. Customer Support: I reached out to the app's customer support multiple times to try to resolve the issues I encountered, but my inquiries have gone unanswered.

In between Xinji and Shanghai which one is located in the Yangtze River Delta? Answer:","completion":"The city that is located in the Yangtze River Delta among the two - Xinji and Shanghai is Shanghai. The Yangtze River Delta or YRD, also known as Yangzi Jiang Delta, is one of the most populous city-regions globally, located in the eastern part of China.

So, it should be clarified that the provincial level municipality of Shanghai is an integral part of this delta. Shanghai, being one of the most crucial global financial hubs, abounds not only in population but also in significant economic implications. This city is also imbued with rich natural resources and complex networks of waterways. Its location in the Yangtze River Delta is a fundamental component facilitating these factors. On the other hand, Xinji is a county-level city of Hebei Province, China, which is administratively a part of the Hengshui city.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by. And besides, her band could do other gigs during the week to supplement it. Question: How old is Sondra?

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I climbed the ladder, heard my dive announced, and began the moves that would push me into the air. Pushing off the diving board with my legs, I lifted my arms and shoulders back, and knew immediately I would be close to the board and might hit my hands. I tried to correct myself as I turned, spreading my hands wide apart. Then I heard a strange sound and my body lost control. Moments later I realized I had hit my head on the board. At the beginning, I felt embarrassed. I wanted to hide, to get out of the pool without anyone seeing me. Next I felt intense fear. Had I cut my head? Was I bleeding? Was there blood in the pool? Swimming to the side, I noticed many shocked faces. People were worried about my head; I was worried about something far more threatening. An official examined my head. In a hurry, I pushed him away, and everyone else who approached me. \\"Don't touch me!\\" I felt like screaming. \\"Get away from me!\\" These were the trials for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Until this dive, I had been ahead. But now, something else was more significant than winning. I might have endangered other divers' lives if I had spilled blood in the pool. For what I knew--- that few others knew - was that I was HIV-positive. According to my mother, my natural parents were Samoan and only teenagers when I was born, so they gave me up for adoption. When I was only eighteen months old, I started gym classes. At ten, I explored doing gym exercises off the diving board at the pool. Because of my dark skin, kids at school called me names. My diving made me feel good about myself when my peers made me feel stupid. At sixteen, I knew I had a shot at the 1976 Olympics. Everyone was alarmed when I hit my head on the board in Seoul. Regardless, I made it to the finals. During my last dive in the finals, I enjoyed for the last time the quietness underwater and then swam to the side of the pool. The crowd cheered, and I knew I'd won --- two gold medals. AIDS forced me to stop diving; I had to give up diving professionally...

Joe unit, which is framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra. Snake Eyes and Jinx locate and capture Storm Shadow after a battle with ninjas and take him to Japan, where Storm Shadow reveals that Zartan murdered the Hard Master, and that he joined Cobra to avenge his uncle.

Q:As they left his house he insured them that it was okay they could come to the party too because it was taking place where? - friend's house - home - patio - fraternity house - boat The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is \\"fraternity house.\\" Based on the given information, it seems that the house where your friend met the others belongs to one of the group members, indicating a personal connection and suggesting that the party might be held at a location where they'd feel comfortable having their friends over. Among the provided options, a friend's house, home, and patio are quite informal and may not accommodate a larger number of guests. Meanwhile, a boat usually has limited space, and it might not be feasible to host a party for a larger group of friends there. A fraternity house, on the other hand, is a more suitable option for hosting a party. A fraternity house is typically associated with a college or university and serves as a residence for members of a social fraternity. These houses often have spacious interiors and can accommodate a larger number of guests, making them ideal for hosting events such as parties. It is also reasonable that a member of the fraternity would be comfortable inviting their friends to a party at the fraternity house, as it may be a place where social events regularly take place. Moreover, fraternity houses are often known for hosting lively parties, with a strong emphasis on community and building connections among members and their friends. As a result, it would be quite natural for a person to invite others to join a party at a fraternity house, making it the best answer among the given options. In conclusion, based on the fact that the group's acquaintance suggested it was okay for them to attend the party, and considering the suitability of the location to host a social event, it is most likely that the party is taking place at a fraternity house. Not only does this option provide ample space for guests, but it also reinforces the close connections found within the group and ensures that everyone has a good time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which student feels he has moved from the second to the third echelon of students? James Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., he assumes the first class will be an outline of the course. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students: Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School Kevin Brooks, a married man with a photographic memory, but no analytical skills Thomas Anderson Willis Bell, an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law O'Connor (Robert Lydiard)While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, due to her feeling uncomfortable with a man who had been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times. Hart divides the class into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \\"upper echelon\\".

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

Input: CLOSE Brady Eaves, 18, the stepson of one-time Mississippi governor candidate John Arthur Eaves Jr, is show biting the head off a live hamster during spring break. Brady Eaves, 18, of Madison, allegedly bit the head off a hamster in a spring break video. Eaves (Photo: Screen grab) The family of a Madison teen who is seen in a spring break video biting the head off a hamster has withdrawn him from enrollment at the University of Mississippi. The teen in the grainy spring break video is Brady Eaves, 18, who was identified as a Phi Delta Theta from Ole Miss. On Tuesday, Phi Delt issued a statement that Eaves has been removed from the fraternity. Eaves is the stepson of one-time Mississippi Governor candidate John Arthur Eaves Jr. John and Angel Eaves released a statement late Tuesday confirming they had withdrawn Brady from school in order to have his behavior professionally assessed. In the video, Eaves is seen wearing a pink shirt with a wolf's face on it. He can be seen picking up the hamster, and then it appears he snaps its neck before biting its head off. He then appears to spit the head on the ground and throw the body as a crowd of people react with screams and cheers. \\"Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet,\\" the Eaves family's statement said. On Tuesday, William Kneip, the president of the Mississippi Alpha Chapter of Phi Delta Theta, said the fraternity condemns Eaves' actions. \\"We are very disappointed and disgusted in Brady's actions. These actions are inconsistent with what we believe as men of Phi Delta Theta and are inconsistent with the creed of the University of Mississippi,\\" Kneip said. \\"This incident was during spring break and is in no way associated with any chapter activity of Phi Delta Theta. Brady has been removed from the fraternity.\\" Ole Miss' spring break was March 9-13. Kneip said the function was not a Phi Delt function, but he would not discuss how long the fraternity has been aware of the video or whether there were other Phi Delts there. He also would not discuss when Eaves was removed from the organization. The video allegedly surfaced Friday night, when it was uploaded to YouTube with the title \\"psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster.\\" It was quickly removed for breaking YouTube's terms of service. \\"As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son,\\" the Eaves' statement read. \\"We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.\\" The Eaves also said that the actions in the video do not reflect Brady Eaves' upbringing, and \\"his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.\\" The statement went on to ask for prayers for Brady Eaves and the family. Officials confirmed that Eaves was a student at the University of Mississippi this semester. \\"University officials were recently made aware of this spring break video and we are actively investigating,\\" said Dr. Brandi Hephner LaBanc, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. \\"While federal law prohibits us from discussing matters that involve individual students, university officials will take appropriate steps as soon as all the facts have been gathered.\\" Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com that he is an \\"animal lover\\" whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot. The Daily Mail cited \\"sources connected to the incident\\" saying that the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and \\"hot-boxed\\" its cage with marijuana before it was orally decapitated. PETA spokeswoman Stephanie Bell said someone sent that video to her organization over the weekend. \\"Obviously we were horrified by the depictions in the video, and people are rightfully outraged about it,\\" she said. \\"Animal abuse is a community concern, and people who abuse animals rarely do so only once, and almost never stop there. The link between cruelty to animals and interpersonal violence is undeniable.\\" Bell said PETA officials are working to verify exactly where the video was made. \\"The Florida statute is actually quite strong. It prohibits causing cruel death or excessive or unnecessary pain or suffering, that would be considered aggravated animal cruelty, which is a felony in the third degree,\\" Bell said. According to Florida case law, psychiatric or psychological counseling is also mandatory for convicted offenders of aggravated animal cruelty. PETA is closely monitoring the situation, and will push for a vigorous prosecution and psychological counseling, Bell said. \\"Animals feel pain stress and fear like we do and they are deserving of our respect and protection,\\" she said. Felony animal cruelty charges in Florida carry a maximum jail term of five years and 5,000 in fines.

Raising teenagers in today's world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation. We would sincerely appreciate that all parents who have gone through similar incidents with their children, and the entire community please keep us in their thoughts and prayers.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Teacher:In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers. Each list is presented with brackets and comma-separated values. For example, a list of numbers is [1,2,3] and a list of two lists of numbers is [[1,2],[3,4,6]]. You should sum up the values at every position of every inner list and put it as an element of your answer, that is, you should sum the first members of each inner list together and put it as the first element of the list, then sum the second members of each inner list together and put it as the second element of your list, etc. The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]] Student:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the input structure. Usage: Here, the input is [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]]. In this example, it's a list containing two inner lists of numbers. The input structure is as follows - a list containing multiple lists, where each list contains numbers. The numbers can be either positive or negative. This meets the criteria because it follows the exact structure mentioned - a list of lists. Part #2: Understanding the operation to perform. Usage: So, the operation here is to \\"sum up the values at each position\\". This means we need to take corresponding elements from each inner list and add them together. From the given input example, we take 77 from the first inner list and 70 from the second inner list, as they are at the same position (first) in both inner lists. Adding these together, we get 147 which becomes the first element of the output list. Part #3: The output list should have the same length as the longest inner list. Usage: The longest inner list in the input [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]] has 4 elements. So, our output list should also be of length 4. We add the corresponding elements of each list, following step #2, resulting in [147, -118, -32, -93]. This meets the criteria as the output is a list which has the same length as the longest inner list from the input. Part #4: The output should be a list of numbers. Usage: After performing the operations explained in step #2 on each position and on each inner list, we get the list [147, -118, -32, -93]. This is a list of numbers, as it should be, and therefore meets the criteria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the name of Jesse's teenage son? Hank. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Secret Life of Hank Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting. My main characters will be Jesse, his teenage son Hank, and their family. The story will be set in a small, close-knit community, with most events taking place in their home, school, and other local spots. Step 2: Develop a central conflict or driving force for the plot. The central conflict will revolve around Hank discovering a shocking secret from Jesse's past that could change their family dynamic. Step 3: Introduce the main characters and set up the problem. In the beginning, we'll be introduced to Jesse, a hardworking and loving father, and Hank, a rebellious and misunderstood teenager. We'll see them struggling to connect as Hank enters high school and is increasingly distant from his father. Jesse tries to keep his family together, while Hank feels disconnected from everyone around him. Step 4: Explore Hank's teenage experiences and introduce the secret. As a subplot, we'll explore Hank's experiences as he tries to find his place among his peers and the perennial challenges of adolescence. Meanwhile, Hank stumbles upon a box of old letters and photos hidden in their attic, revealing that Jesse had another family before he met Hank's mother. The previous family had seemingly vanished, leaving no trace behind. Step 5: Increase tension and develop characters. The discovery of this secret fuels Hank's curiosity and estrangement from his father. Both characters are developed as they navigate this new conflict. Jesse becomes more secretive, trying to prevent the truth from coming out, while Hank becomes more determined to uncover the mystery behind his father's past. Step 6: Reach a turning point. The turning point occurs when Hank, with the help of his new high school friends, finds one of Jesse's long-lost family members and learns that Jesse was forced to leave his previous family to protect them from a dangerous past involving criminal activity. Step 7: Escalate the stakes. With this new information, Hank is torn between confronting his father or keeping the secret. As the truth spills out, Jesse's past enemies catch wind of his new life, putting Hank and his family in danger. Step 8: Climax and resolution. In the climax, Jesse and Hank must reconcile their differences and work together to protect their family and resolve past conflicts. With the help of their tight-knit community, they face Jesse's old enemies and expose the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of Jesse's first family. In the end, Jesse and Hank rebuild their relationship and forge a deeper bond, having learned the importance of honesty and understanding between a father and son. Step 9: Conclusion. The film concludes with Hank and Jesse finding closure and a newfound appreciation for each other. They continue to build and strengthen their relationship, while cherishing the bonds of family and community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: the girls are fifteen .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"In analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, we must closely examine the information provided and assess the logical connections between them. Premise: Two girls are playing instruments in a group. The premise informs us that there are two girls who are part of a group and that they play instruments. This statement provides a basic description of the girls' involvement in the group and their role as musicians. However, it does not provide any explicit information related to their age. Hypothesis: The girls are fifteen. The hypothesis proposes that the girls are fifteen years old. This statement attempts to make a connection between the ages of the girls and their participation in the group. Now, let's evaluate whether we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Since the premise only describes the girls' roles as musicians in a group, there is no direct or indirect information provided regarding their ages. The premise and hypothesis are two distinct statements, with the former focusing on the girls' activities and the latter on their ages. Consequently, the truth of the premise cannot automatically validate the hypothesis, which means that we cannot conclude that the girls are fifteen based only on the premise. In conclusion, while the premise is true and provides valuable context about the girls' involvement in a music group, it does not contain sufficient information to confirm or refute the hypothesis. To determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, additional information, such as the girls' birthdates or explicit age references, would be necessary. As it stands, there is no valid basis for concluding that the girls are fifteen based solely on the provided premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - get out what i am going to eat with. - get food - eat food - stop working - find food Explain why a human would choose \\"eat food\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"eat food\\" as the correct answer to the question \\"What do you do when you have lunch?\\" because the primary purpose of having lunch is to consume and enjoy food. While the other options listed might be steps involved in the overall process of having lunch, \\"eat food\\" is the central action. Here's a brief explanation for each option: - Get out what I am going to eat with: This step involves preparing utensils, plates, or other items needed to eat lunch. It is a prerequisite step in the process, but not the main action. - Get food: This step could refer to collecting or purchasing food that will be eaten for lunch. Again, this is an important part of the process but not the primary objective of having lunch. - Eat food: This is the correct answer because it represents the core purpose of having lunch. Eating food is essential as it provides the human body with nutrients and energy necessary for functioning. - Stop working: While it's true that many people often take a break from work during lunchtime, this is not the main action of having lunch. Stopping work might accompany having lunch, but it is not the sole purpose. - Find food: Similar to \\"get food,\\" this step refers to the process of locating or choosing food to eat, rather than the actual act of consuming it. In conclusion, \\"eat food\\" is the appropriate answer to the question, as it directly represents the main goal of having lunch - consuming food to satiate hunger and provide energy to the body."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sir Mervyn King said the New York State Department of Financial Services was wrong to make the claims when other regulators were still investigating any wrong-doing.

Which board game has a maximum score of 307: Twin Tin Bots or Take It Easy? A:","completion":"After researching and analyzing the scoring mechanisms for both Twin Tin Bots and Take It Easy, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer. Twin Tin Bots is a strategic board game where players program robots to collect and deliver crystals while avoiding various obstacles. Each player has these mini-bots at their disposal to gather resources and bring them back to their base. The scoring mechanism of this game is centered around collecting the highest value crystals represented by different shapes or colors. The scoring criteria of Twin Tin Bots depend on the value of the crystals that bots collect. There's no specific maximum score with a clearly defined numeric value mentioned for this game. The winner is determined by whoever collects the most valuable crystals by the end of the game. Take It Easy, on the other hand, is a tile-placement board game where players arrange hexagonal tiles onto their own game boards. Each tile consists of three colored lines, which converge at its center. The game objective is to align the same-colored lines to connect adjacent edges of the game board. When this is achieved, players gain points, and the scores are based on the number shown on each line multiplied by the length of the connected line. The maximum score in Take It Easy is achieved when a player can align all three colors in the most optimal way across the board. Through optimal placement, players can achieve a maximum score of 307 points, which is the highest score in standard Take It Easy. In conclusion, the board game with a maximum score of 307 points is Take It Easy. The game's scoring structure relies on the tiles' value and their strategic placement to create continuous lines. Twin Tin Bots is about acquiring valuable crystals, and though a winner is determined by the end of the game, no numeric maximum score is specified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the review, the author uses negative phrases such as \\"This was a really bad movie\\" and \\"I can see why there will probably not be a follow-up movie,\\" which demonstrate dissatisfaction with the product. Moreover, the reviewer compares the movie unfavorably to other popular franchises, like Harry Potter and Narnia, implying that this film fails to meet the desired quality or expectation level. The only slightly positive comment in the review is the suggestion that the source material (the book) might be better than the movie adaptation.

Here's my step-by-step analysis of this: 1. Understand the query: The user is asking for the meaning of the term \\"Thorn Ey\\". 2. Analyze the provided information: The sentence provided gives historical context - it mentions a tradition reported around 1080 about a church founded on a site known as Thorn Ey in the 7th century, during the time of Mellitus, a Bishop of London. 3. Draw a connection: Although the sentence identifies \\"Thorn Ey\\" as a location ('a site' - probably an island given it's referred to as 'Thorn Island' in parentheses), it does not provide information on the meaning of the term \\"Thorn Ey\\". 4. Conclusion: The sentence offers background knowledge on where and when the term \\"Thorn Ey\\" was used, but it doesn't explain what it means. So, to succinctly answer the user's question: No, the sentence does not correctly answer the question of what \\"Thorn Ey\\" means – the sentence offers context to the term but not its meaning.

Sentence 2: If John isn't acquitted, it will only make Mary happier. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The first sentence implies that Mary's happiness depends on John being acquitted, which suggests that she cares for him or his situation. This sentence shows concern for Mary's well-being and assumes that her happiness is closely tied to the outcome of John's acquittal. In this context, Mary's happiness would be significantly affected if John were not acquitted, and the speaker hopes that the situation remains in favor of John. The second sentence, however, contradicts the first sentence. It states that Mary would be happier if John is not acquitted, suggesting that Mary's happiness would increase with a negative outcome for John. This sentence implies that Mary may have reasons to desire an unfavorable result for John, such as resentment, revenge, or personal gain. Since the two sentences are in direct contradiction with each other, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence would be false. The truth of the first sentence implies that Mary's happiness is associated with John's acquittal, while the second sentence suggests that her happiness is linked to his conviction. Therefore, they cannot both be true simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source, Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

The sixty-one year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any Chinese emperor. Kangxi's reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era known as the \\"High Qing\\", during which the dynasty reached the zenith of its social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers — Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi — were chosen for their long service, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most important, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However, as time passed, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi — a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who ruled while Kangxi was young?","completion":"While Kangxi was young, the governance of the Qing dynasty was in the hands of four senior cabinet ministers - Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi - who were appointed by Kangxi's father, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed. These ministers were intended to support and guide the young emperor, counteract each other's influences, and prevent the monopolization of power that had occurred during previous regencies. Kangxi eventually managed to remove the most dominant among them, Oboi, and asserted his control over the government when he was fifteen years old. Thus, during Kangxi's youth, the four ministers effectively ruled the empire in a regency until the emperor was able to consolidate power and govern directly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Exceptional Dining Experience at The River's Edge Last Saturday, my friends and I decided to try out The River's Edge, a restaurant we've heard nothing but rave reviews about. Our expectations were high; however, the incredible experience we had surpassed everything we could have imagined. We had reservations for 7 pm, and upon arriving, we found the restaurant to be nestled in a picturesque setting alongside a serene river. The outdoor patio allowed a breathtaking view of the waterfront. The atmosphere was warm, inviting, and elegant, with dimly lit candles, beautiful table settings, and soft music playing in the background. It was the perfect balance of sophistication and comfort. We were seated right away by the friendly host, who offered us a delightful view of the river. Our server, Sarah, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and attentive throughout our entire dining experience. She suggested some fabulous appetizers to start, and we were delighted with her recommendations. The spinach and artichoke dip with warm pita bread was creamy and delectable, and the crispy calamari was seasoned to perfection. For the main course, I opted for the pan-seared salmon with roasted garlic potatoes, while my friends ordered the filet mignon and the parmesan-crusted chicken. Each dish was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful presentation. The flavors were bold and innovative, and the portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming. To complete our meal, Sarah suggested we indulge in the chef's signature dessert: vanilla bean crème brûlée. This was, without a doubt, the best crème brûlée I have ever tasted – the caramelized sugar on top had a wonderful crunch, and the custard was velvety smooth. Throughout the evening, the service was consistent and attentive without being intrusive. Sarah regularly checked on us, and the restaurant's management even stopped by our table to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction. We were impressed by this level of attention and care towards the patrons. The River's Edge not only delivered a mouthwatering meal but also offered an evening filled with wonderful ambiance, exceptional service, and an unparalleled view. Our expectations were truly exceeded, and I know we will be returning in the near future. I would highly recommend The River's Edge to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or indulge in an unforgettable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Eden Foods has become the new front line in the contest over religion, health care and the workplace. Eden Foods is a closely held, for-profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds. It lost its lawsuit last October, but the ruling was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision on Hobby Lobby. Now, Eden Foods has a clear legal pathway to deny contraception coverage to its employees. Eden Foods, however, is in a very different business than Hobby Lobby. It sells organic products, a market that relies on educated, well-informed, urban consumers, a demographic that trends liberal. In response to the renewed attention on the Eden Foods case, defenders of the company, people who want to buy their products with a clean conscience, and the organic food stores who want to stay out of the crossfire, are all arguing that this is just a political dispute. Moreover, I base my conclusion that the issue at hand is ethical, and not political, on the statements coming from OPTIONS: - CNN itself. - David Perry itself. - Eden Foods itself. - Hobby Lobby itself. - Perry itself. - Supreme Court itself. - Whole Foods itself.","completion":"Eden Foods itself.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago.

Answer the question Near Earth's equator, water generally exists naturally in the liquid and gas states. In which other part of Earth is water usually found naturally in only two states? Select from: (a). Indian Ocean; (b). interior of Africa; (c). South Pole; (d). Tropic of Cancer;","completion":"The correct answer to this question is (c). South Pole. At the South Pole, water is generally found naturally in only two states: solid and gas. The South Pole is located at Earth's southernmost point, on the continent of Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen continent, with its ice sheet containing nearly 90% of Earth's freshwater reserves. Due to the extreme cold, water exists primarily in the solid state, as ice, and in the gas state, as water vapor. To further clarify this point, let's examine why the other options are not correct: (a) Indian Ocean: The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water, and as with any ocean, it predominantly features water in its liquid state. Here, water can be found in all three states: solid (in the form of icebergs and frozen regions near Antarctica), liquid (the majority of the ocean), and gas (water vapor evaporating from the ocean). (b) Interior of Africa: The interior of Africa spans a wide range of climates, from the arid Sahara Desert to lush, green savannas and rainforests. In these diverse environments, water is typically found in all three states: solid (in high-altitude regions like mountain ranges), liquid (e.g., lakes, rivers, and groundwater), and gas (humidity and evaporation). (d) Tropic of Cancer: The Tropic of Cancer is the northernmost latitude where the sun can be directly overhead at its zenith. This line runs through various continents, each with distinct climate zones and water availability. As such, water is usually found naturally in all three states in different regions along the Tropic of Cancer: solid (in high-altitude regions like the Himalayas), liquid (lakes, rivers, oceans), and gas (water vapor and humidity). In summary, the South Pole (Antarctica) is the place where water is typically found naturally in only two states, solid and gas, due to its extremely cold and inhospitable environment. In contrast, options A, B, and D involve a wider range of climate zones and geographic locations, where water can be found in all three states: solid, liquid, and gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Sasha's decision to represent herself in court may have been influenced by several factors. It's essential to understand that when someone chooses to represent themselves in legal proceedings, they essentially act as their own attorney. This scenario is often referred to as \\"pro se\\" representation, which is a Latin term meaning \\"on one's own behalf.\\" Below are some reasons why Sasha may have chosen to take this route: 1. Financial constraints: Hiring a lawyer can be expensive, and not everyone is in a position to afford one. Legal fees can add up quickly and become a significant burden, especially if the case drags on for an extended period. Sasha may have opted to represent herself to save money. 2. Confidence in her own capabilities: It's possible that Sasha felt confident in her ability to represent herself effectively. Her background, education, or prior experiences may have given her the necessary skills to navigate the legal system without the assistance of a lawyer. 3. Belief in the simplicity of the case: Sasha might have thought that her case was simple enough to handle without professional legal assistance. If the case involved a straightforward issue or demanded a simple resolution, she may have believed that she could handle it on her own. 4. Desire for control: By representing herself in court, Sasha maintained full control over her case. She may have had previous negative experiences working with attorneys or gained a distrust of the legal profession in general. This could have prompted her decision to handle the case independently, allowing her to make all necessary decisions and control her narrative entirely. 5. A lack of trust in available legal representation: Sasha may not have been able to find a lawyer she felt comfortable working with or trusted to handle her case effectively. This situation could arise if she had limited options for local attorneys or encountered challenges in selecting an attorney within her budget. 6. Limited access to adequate legal representation: In some cases, individuals might struggle to secure appropriate legal counsel due to factors such as workload constraints or a shortage of qualified lawyers in their area. This could have led Sasha to decide that representing herself was the best option. It's important to remember that representing oneself in court can be a very challenging and complex process. While some individuals may have valid reasons for choosing to do so, it's generally recommended to seek professional legal counsel when engaging with the legal system. This is because legal proceedings often involve intricate rules of evidence and procedure that can be difficult to navigate without proper training and experience. Moreover, having a lawyer can significantly impact the outcome of a case by ensuring that a defendant's rights are fully protected throughout the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person who ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region? In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enríquez de Guzmán, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán.

Some sticky substances, like hot glue or gum, become very brittle when they are frozen. Put the fabric in the freezer until the sticky substance is completely frozen. This method works better with gum and glue-like substances rather than stickers or sticky substances that have seeped into the fabric.

To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure. In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure. Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas?","completion":"To determine which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas, we need to consider the effect of pressure on gas solubility in a liquid. This can be explained using Henry's Law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. This means that the higher the pressure applied, the more gas will dissolve in the liquid. Step 1: Look at the pressure conditions for both containers. Container A: High pressure Container B: Low pressure Step 2: Apply Henry's Law to determine solubility under each condition. - Under high pressure (Container A), the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be higher, as a greater amount of gas will dissolve in the liquid. - Under low pressure (Container B), the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be lower, as a lesser amount of gas will dissolve in the liquid. Conclusion: Based on Henry's Law and the pressure conditions, container B will have a lower solubility of nitrogen gas compared to container A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: A). negative; B). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness","completion":"The phrase \\"of scene-chewing, teeth-gnashing actorliness\\" can be considered negative in its connotation. First of all, let's deconstruct the phrase to understand its meaning better. 1. Scene-chewing: This term is an informal way to describe actors who engage in an exaggerated, over-the-top style of acting. These actors tend to play their roles with high energy and excessive emoting, often drawing too much attention to themselves and away from the narrative or other characters. Overacting, or \\"chewing the scenery,\\" can be off-putting and disruptive in the context of a film, play, or television show, consequently leading to a negative interpretation of the phrase. 2. Teeth-gnashing: Gnashing one's teeth usually implies aggressiveness, frustration, anger, or annoyance. The term is often used figuratively to express intense negative emotions. When applied to an actor's performance, it suggests that their portrayal of a character is filled with extreme emotions, possibly to the point of being grating or tiresome for the audience. 3. Actorliness: This term refers to the quality of being an actor or the propensity to act in a theatrical manner. In the context of the given phrase, it seems to accentuate the excessiveness of the acting style mentioned earlier, adding to the negative connotation. In summary, the phrase \\"of scene-chewing, teeth-gnashing actorliness\\" describes a theatrical, over-the-top, and excessively emotional acting style that detracts from the overall quality of a performance. This description carries a negative connotation, as it implies that the actor's approach is not adequately aligned with the intentions of the material being performed. The exaggerated expressions and emotions may overshadow other elements of the performance, yielding an undesirable and disruptive effect on the audience's experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Have you ever been in a situation, where you felt uneasy because of something you think you may have forgotten to do or perhaps a feeling that you annoyed someone whom you wanted to get along with really well. If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the \\"bad guy\\", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest. The best way to different anxiety from any serious illness is to ask a medical expert for advice on a regular basis.

Is \\"This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"While the statement \\"This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.\\" is indeed related to some of the issues that can cause software to underperform, there are numerous other non-functional dimensions to consider. Non-functional dimensions refer to attributes that affect the performance and quality of software but do not impact its primary functional requirements. Here is a detailed and long answer that explores various non-functional dimensions that can cause software to underperform and cause other problems: 1. Scalability: If a software system is not able to handle an increased workload or number of users, it may underperform. Scalability issues can arise from ineffective resource management and communication overhead. 2. Reliability: A software system's reliability is its capacity to consistently operate correctly over an extended period. A system that experiences frequent crashes or errors can cause significant disruptions and hinder user satisfaction. 3. Performance: This relates to a software system's ability to process tasks or requests expediently. Performance issues can arise due to poor algorithm efficiency, inadequate hardware, or insufficient resources. 4. Maintainability: Code maintainability denotes the ease with which a software system can be modified, updated, or enhanced. Poorly maintainable code can lead to increased costs, technical debt, and potential errors during updates or modifications. 5. Testability: Software testability is the degree to which a system can be tested effectively and efficiently. It's crucial to identify defects early in the development lifecycle. Poor testability can result in the discovery of defects later in the process, leading to increased costs and delays. 6. Usability: A system's usability evaluates how easy and intuitive it is for the user to interact with it. Poor usability can hinder user adoption, lower productivity, and lead to errors. 7. Security: Security addresses the protection of software systems against unauthorized access and nefarious activity. Neglecting security can lead to data breaches, compromised systems, and a loss of user trust. 8. Portability: Software portability refers to the ability of a system to function effectively across different platforms and environments. Lack of portability can make it difficult to transition a software system between platforms, hindering its adaptation and limiting its potential user base. 9. Compatibility: Compatibility is the ability of a software system to work seamlessly with other systems, devices, or components. Incompatibilities can result in conflicts, resource consumption problems, and degradation of system functionality. 10. Resilience: A resilient software system can recover quickly from failures or disruptions without losing data or encountering significant downtime. Insufficient resilience can negatively impact stakeholder trust and lead to higher operational costs. In conclusion, numerous non-functional dimensions can cause software to underperform and cause other problems. While the presence of defects, as mentioned in the original statement, is a valid concern, it is essential to evaluate these other aspects when assessing software performance and the potential issues that may arise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the last couple of years the selfie has seen a meteoric rise to fame and was even given the Royal Seal of approval during the Commonwealth Games when some opportunistic youngsters managed to take one with her Majesty in the background. But now there is a new way to document your day – the dronie, where all of your photos are taken by a drone. French drone manufacturer Parrot say the increasingly popular method of using a remote controlled miniature aircraft is down to 'narcissism' - as people are buying them ready fitted with cameras in order to film themselves. Forget selfies - people are now using drones to take photos and videos, like this couple in Portugal. Up to 30,000 of the remote-controlled devices are predicted to have been sold by the end of this year. Drones are also increasingly being used at weddings, giving the bride and groom high-quality footage of their big day from an aerial perspective. Henri Seydoux, Parrot’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the drones of the future will be able to pilot themselves, automatically following their subject around. He told the paper: ‘It would be like having a full TV crew with you when you went snowboarding or mountain climbing.’ He said that sales of drones jumped by 130 per cent in the third quarter of the year, taking the company by surprise. A woman gets her photo taken by a remote controlled flying dronie in a snow covered New Zealand. A group of brave adventurers had this picture taken by a dronie in Costa Rica as they crossed a rope bridge. Mr Seydoux added: ‘It turned out that in reality people bought the drones because of narcissism. ‘People want to put pictures on YouTube of them looking strong and talented, and that is why people want the cameras.’ However, last month it was revealed a passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. The incident involved an Airbus A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers, and was rated by investigators as among the most serious near-collisions. The aircraft was at just 700ft at 2.16pm on July 22 when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. He reported the sighting and an inquiry was launched by the UK Airprox Board, which investigates all reported near-misses. Investigators, however, were unable to identify it. It comes amid concern over the threat to aircraft from domestic drones flown by amateurs - especially as they are expected to be a must have Christmas present this year. Drones cost from as little as £35 - and sales have jumped thanks to extra demand. It is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by British consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as Christmas presents. The electronics chain Maplin says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013. Last month, a conference on unmanned aerial systems in London heard that police were worried about injuries and other problems on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones. This group of friends and their dogs shot a video on a dronie of their walk up Bernal Hill in San Francisco. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

The local authorities may also suggest some other methods of deterrence that you have not thought of. Developing a relationship with your local police creates a team approach to deterring graffiti. Good quality security cameras are expensive but even cheaper ones have a deterrent effect because people see them and assume that they are being filmed. Erect them where they are obvious and be sure to secure them well. Post signs that say “All activity is being monitored.” You can even add security cameras and never turn them on. People will automatically assume that they are being watched. Join up and place the signs about your area. Be sure to do your bit as others help you out too. Attend local meetings to discuss happenings in the area and to come up with ideas for dealing with challenges as a group. You can also contact your local Keep America Beautiful affiliate to create a graffiti awareness program for your neighborhood. Call (203) 659-3000 or email info@kab.org. Suggest graffiti deterrence as a topic for a watch meeting and invite local law enforcement. If you become a victim of graffiti, remove it within 24 to 48 hours. If you remove it quickly, there is very little chance of it becoming a reoccurring problem. If the graffiti is in a public area next to your property, call your city and county officials to report it as soon as possible.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Opponents say that the expansion will make air quality and noise pollution much worse. It makes a complete mockery of the government's commitments on cutting carbon emissions, they say. But supporters of the airport say that developments in technology will mitigate many negative consequences. Third runway at Heathrow cleared for takeoff What happens next? Why expansion is taking so long Is new runway more important post-Brexit? The green price of Heathrow expansion Death sentence for Heathrow villages In its final report on Heathrow last year, the Airports Commission was clear that an extra runway at the UK's biggest flight centre would be an opportunity to right some of the environmental wrongs that have developed through ad hoc expansion over the years. These include increased levels of noise for local residents, consistent breaches of air pollution safety levels and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Perhaps the easiest of these issues to tackle is noise. The Airports Commission suggested that a \\"noise envelope\\" should be agreed and Heathrow would be legally bound to stay within these limits. There should also be an increased noise levy to benefit local communities - and an independent aviation noise committee should be established with a statutory right to be consulted on operating procedures. In their statement announcing the airport's expansion, the government gave some clear indications of how it will tackle this question. It will propose a six-and-a-half hour ban on scheduled night flights for the first time. It will also propose new legally binding noise targets that will encourage the use of quieter planes - and there will be a pot of cash, some Â£700m, to pay for noise insulation for local residents. On the other two key environmental impacts the government is on far trickier ground. When it comes to dirty air, the UK has been breaching EU limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) since 2010 in a number of different regions and cities. This pollutant is produced from diesel engines and is linked to a range of respiratory illnesses. Heathrow has long been a hot spot for this type of air pollution due to heavy traffic in the vicinity - so much so that the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) projected that even without expansion, the A4 running north of the airport would still exceed EU safety limits for nitrogen dioxide in 2030. The airport points to recent independent research that says the expansion would only lead to a \\"marginal\\" increase in NO2 from Heathrow as there would be significant reductions elsewhere thanks to changes in diesel engines and greater use of electric vehicles. Campaigners are not impressed with this conclusion. \\"The measures that people have put forward seem fairly far fetched in terms of implementation,\\" said Tim Johnson, from the Aviation Environment Federation. \\"Ideas like taking diesel cars off the road are indeed potential solutions, but how do you get consumer change that makes that happen in the time scale?\\" Perhaps the biggest environmental challenge of the expansion is the impact on climate change goals. Existing UK legislation commits the government to cut CO2 levels by 80% of 1990 levels in 2050. Aviation right now accounts for around 6% of UK emissions. To meet the legal target, emissions from this sector would would have to stay below the 2005 mark. This could be partly achieved with improvements in fuel and aircraft operational efficiency and the wider use of biofuels, says the independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC). They are calling on the government to publish a strategic policy framework for UK aviation emissions to limit them to 2005 levels. To keep below the target, the CCC says that \\"this could imply limiting the growth in demand to around 60% above 2005 levels by 2050 (45% above current levels).\\" That could mean the government having to cut airport capacity in regional airports or have other sectors of the economy make deeper emissions cuts. \\"You only have so much carbon to go round,\\" said Tim Johnson. \\"The government will have to decide how best to distribute that, if they decide to use that for a new runway then there will have to be a hit elsewhere.\\" But speaking in the House of Commons, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling refuted the suggestion that the expansion of Heathrow was bad for the climate. \\"We take the issue of climate change very seriously and this government has a whole raft of measures in place to address the issue, but we also have to make sure that we have the prosperity in this country to do things like funding our NHS and funding our old age pensions, and having a thriving modern economy with strong links around the world is an important part of that.\\" Other campaigning groups believe the lack of a clear plan on how to mitigate increases in CO2 make the third runway a very bad idea. \\"With the government poised to sign the Paris climate agreement, it's decision to expand Heathrow - shortly after forcing fracking on the people of Lancashire - looks deeply cynical,\\" said Andrew Pendleton, from Friends of the Earth. \\"However this is only the first step on a long journey that will see communities, councils and climate campaigners continue the battle to reverse this misjudged and damaging decision.\\" One area in which there is a little dispute over the benefits of Heathrow's expansion is in regard to wildlife.

What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the environmental implications of expanding Heathrow with a third runway. Critics argue that the expansion will exacerbate air and noise pollution, contradicting the government's carbon emission reduction commitments. However, supporters assert that technological advancements will counterbalance these negative impacts. The Airports Commission’s report details how the expansion could address existing environmental issues at Heathrow, such as increased noise exposure, consistent air pollution safety level breaches, and rising CO2 emissions. A suggested solution is a \\"noise envelope\\", legally binding limits within which Heathrow must operate. Additionally, they recommend higher noise levies to benefit local communities and the use of quieter planes. On the topic of air pollution, the UK has been surpassing EU nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits since 2010. This pollutant, a byproduct of diesel engines, is linked to respiratory illnesses. Despite research suggesting the expansion will only marginally increase NO2 levels due to engine alterations and increased electric vehicle use, campaigners remain skeptical. The most significant environmental challenge posed by the expansion, according to the article, is the conflict with climate change goals. Current UK law mandates an 80% reduction on CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Aviation currently contributes around 6% to these emissions. To meet the target, measures such as fuel improvements, increased operational efficiency, and a shift towards biofuels are needed, according to the independent Committee on Climate Change. While there's concern that pursuing the expansion could rob other sectors of needed carbon allowances, there is a lack of controversy regarding the potential benefits for local wildlife, as the airport has promised a £105m plan to convert a green area near it into a sanctuary four times the size of Hyde Park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","completion":"Fresh oranges have a lower sugar content compared to candied plums. Candying fruits involves soaking them in sugar syrup for an extended period, which causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar. This process significantly increases the sugar content of the fruit compared to their fresh counterparts. Candied plums, being subjected to this process, will have a much higher sugar content than they naturally possess. On the other hand, fresh oranges have not undergone any preservation or sugar infusion process, so their sugar content remains the same as it is naturally occurring in the fruit.

Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. After the band's disbanding in 1995, Lesh continued the tradition of Grateful Dead family music with side project Phil Lesh and Friends, which paid homage to the Dead's music by playing their originals, common covers, and the songs of the members of his band. Lesh operates a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads. He scaled back his touring regimen in 2014 but continues to perform with Phil Lesh & Friends at select venues. Lesh was an innovator in the new role that the electric bass developed during the mid-1960s. Contemporaries such as Casady, Bruce, James Jamerson and Paul McCartney adopted a more melodic, contrapuntal approach to the instrument; before this, bass players in rock had generally played a conventional timekeeping role within the beat of the song, and within (or underpinning) the song's harmonic or chord structure. While not abandoning these aspects, Lesh took his own improvised excursions during a song or instrumental. This was a characteristic aspect of the so-called San Francisco Sound in the new rock music. In many Dead jams, Lesh's bass is, in essence, as much a lead instrument as Garcia's guitar. Lesh was not a prolific composer or singer with the Grateful Dead, although some of the songs he did contribute--\\"New Potato Caboose\\", \\"Box of Rain\\", \\"Unbroken Chain\\", and \\"Pride of Cucamonga\\"--are among the best-known in the band's repertoire. Lesh's high tenor voice contributed to the Grateful Dead's three-part harmony sections in their group vocals in the early days of the band, until he largely relinquished singing high parts to Donna Godchaux (and thence Brent Mydland and Vince Welnick) in 1976 due to vocal cord damage from improper singing technique. In 1985, he resumed singing lead vocals on select songs as a baritone. Throughout the Grateful Dead's career, his interest in avant-garde music remained a crucial influence on the group. In 1994, he was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he win any awards for his music","completion":"Yes, in 1994, Phil Lesh was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on Syn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the Syn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of Syn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.","completion":"What role does heme play in the progression of Parkinson's disease according to the passage?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. LANGHORNE, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania township with more money than it anticipated from increased property tax collection has decided to give the dividends to residents. Middletown Township in Langhorne sent 14,361 checks for 68 each to all owners of properties with structures on them. Efforts to keep town expenses down while increasing delinquent-tax collection led to more money than anticipated in the general fund. The township board of supervisors decided to divide a 1 million portion of the surplus evenly among property owners. Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Amy Strouse tells the Bucks County Courier Times it's irresponsible for a township to hang on to that level of funding when it has \\"the opportunity to help people out a little bit.\\" Strouse says residents feel as though they pay too much in taxes. ||||| Supervisors in April voted to return 1 million from Middletown's general fund to 14,361 township property owners. Those owners were mailed 68 checks earlier this month. Middletown officials ended up having a little extra cash in hand, and now, so do property owners in the township. The township in early June sent 68 checks as one-time \\"financial appropriations\\" to 14,361 \\"owners of improved property\\" — in legal terms, anyone who owns township property that isn't vacant land, said Solicitor James Esposito. The supervisors' April decision to let go of 1 million of its general fund followed a discussion among board members and some public speakers of the merit of sending the money back to taxpayers compared to keeping it in township coffers. Officials supportive of the payments have pointed to what they see as Middletown's healthy general fund balance — 9,734,300, as of last year's end, on account of the township paying less than it budgeted for most expenditures — plus around 900,000 Keystone Collections recovered in delinquent earned income taxes. In light of those figures, board vice Chairman Mike Ksiazek said the checks would be a way to reduce the \\"tremendous financial burden\\" township residents told him about while he was campaigning for office last year. Ksiazek said it is his \\"sincere belief that, if it's prudent and financially responsible to do so, then at least some of that money should be returned,\\" and that he hopes it will spur property development and improvement. Supervisor William Oettinger, the five-person board's lone vote against the payments, disagreed, calling them \\"completely uncalled for\\" and saying the township should instead use the money to hire more police and public works department employees. Immediately after approving the checks in April, supervisors voted to appropriate money for hiring one new police officer and one new public works laborer. \\"The status quo isn't good enough when you have department heads telling you they need more help, and we keep on shooting them down, or throwing them a bone now and then, 'Here's one cop there, here's a public works guy there' ... this just doesn't make any sense.\\" Resident Nancy McCann addressed the board, saying, \\"I'd love to get the 70 back, that's fine with me ... but to give away money that you say we don't have to get additional police officers, I would hate to cut off our nose to spite our face.\\" Supervisors Chairwoman Amy Strouse said the board has heard \\"loud and clear\\" from residents that they feel they pay too much in taxes. The board can strike a balance between giving residents relief and hiring new employees, she added. \\"We are in a situation where the general fund balance has crept up over time, and I think it's irresponsible for a township to hang on to that level of funding when we have the opportunity to help people out a little bit,\\" she said. \\"And if 70 is going to help somebody out a little bit with their medical bills, with putting food on the table for the next month or making their mortgage payment, then that's not an opportunity that I'm willing to pass up.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Middletown Township in Langhorne, Pennsylvania had extra money because they collected more property taxes than they expected. So, the leaders of the town decided to share this extra money with the people who own houses and buildings there. They sent each of those owners a check for 68.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Is the air around Mark more or less dense than the air around Jackie? Jackie and Mark are two friends who are spending a day at the beach. Jackie wants to go out on the boat to spend some time on the ocean, but Mark wants to lay out on the beach and relax. Since they can't agree, Jackie goes out on the boat alone while Mark stays behind on the beach. Hint: In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.","completion":"In this situation, the air around Mark is less dense than the air around Jackie. The reason for this difference in air density is due to the effect of sea breezes and land breezes, which play an important role in coastal regions. When the sun heats up the land, due to its lower specific heat compared to water, the land surface temperature increases and in turn heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air above the land is less dense, causing it to rise and creating an area of lower pressure. Since Mark is on the beach, he is in an area where the air is warmer and less dense due to the heating of the land. On the other hand, the sea is warmed more slowly by the sun, and thus, the air above the sea is generally cooler. This cooler air has a higher sea-level pressure, which results in denser air. As Jackie is out on the boat over the ocean, the air surrounding her is cooler and denser. The pressure gradient between the ocean and the land establishes a sea breeze, causing the cooler and denser air above the sea to flow inland towards the lower pressure area on the land. Therefore, the air around Mark on the beach is less dense than the air around Jackie, who is out on the boat over the ocean."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What does a real estate agent typically do when describing homes? Possible A: charming, cover up, exaggerate, incompetent, smile Why is \\"exaggerate\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Exaggerate\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because real estate agents may sometimes emphasize or embellish certain aspects of a property to make it more appealing to potential buyers. While a good real estate agent should always prioritize honesty and transparency, it is common for agents to use persuasive language and selective details to highlight the positive features of a home and downplay any negative aspects. In the context of describing homes, the term \\"exaggerate\\" suggests that the agent is providing an enhanced or embellished account of the property, but not necessarily being dishonest. This practice falls within the scope of marketing and requires a good understanding of the buyer's needs and preferences. The agent's goal is to make a successful sale and match their clients with suitable properties, so emphasizing the property's strong points can aid in achieving this objective. However, it's important to note that not all real estate agents will exaggerate while describing homes. When selecting a real estate agent, it's crucial to find someone who is trustworthy, knowledgeable, and has your best interests in mind."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided, Jeff's soil is hypoxic, which means it has lower levels of oxygen compared to healthy soil. Hypoxic soil conditions can lead to an increase in toxic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, which are produced by certain microorganisms in this low-oxygen environment. On the other hand, Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, implying that it likely has normal oxygen levels and fewer toxic compounds. Therefore, Jeff's soil has more toxic compounds than Brandon's soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","completion":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding. When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, we learn that the motion of particles in a substance increases when heated, causing an increase in pressure due to faster and more frequent particle collisions with the walls of the container. In this case, the container is the unvented can of soup. When Team A heated the unvented can of soup, the increasing pressure within the can had no way of being released. As the temperature and pressure continued to rise inside the can, the pressure exerted on the walls of the container also increased. Eventually, the pressure could become too great for the can to withstand, causing it to explode. In contrast, Team B heated a can of soup that had been vented first, allowing the pressure to be released as the temperature within the can increased. This controlled release of pressure reduced the risk of the can exploding due to excessive pressure buildup. Therefore, Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding compared to Team B."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

One of which country's banknotes showed the composer Sibelius","completion":"The country whose banknotes featured the composer Jean Sibelius was Finland. Jean Sibelius, born in 1865 and deceased in 1957, was a Finnish composer and violinist, who played a significant role in Finnish nationalism and became an integral part of the country's national identity. His music inspired patriotism and showcased Finland's rich cultural history and folklore. On the 100 Finnish markka banknote issued between 1986 and 2002, Jean Sibelius was depicted on the obverse side. This banknote demonstrated the country's appreciation and respect for Sibelius's substantial impact on Finnish music and culture. The reverse of the 100 markka note featured an abstract illustration of swans, inspired by his symphonic poem, 'The Swan of Tuonela,' which is a part of the suite called 'Lemminkäinen Suite,' Op. 22. Jean Sibelius's works include seven symphonies, symphonic poems such as 'Finlandia,' 'Tapiola,' 'The Oceanides,' 'Pohjola's Daughter,' and 'Karelia Suite,' choral music, chamber music, and more than 100 art songs. His compositions became soundtracks to important historical events and played an essential part in the cultural and political emergence of Finland. He embodied the Romantic Nationalist movement that took place in European music during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2002, Finland adopted the euro as its official currency, and the Finnish markka became obsolete, thus ending the circulation of the 100 markka banknote featuring Sibelius. Although no longer in circulation, the banknote's design and cultural significance serve as reminders of the composer's role in shaping Finland's national identity and his lasting impact on the country's music and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\"?

Answer: The Imperial Harem held significant power within the Ottoman court and was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would get involved in state politics, and there was a period when the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state, which came to be known as the \\"Sultanate of Women.\\" As for the educational system, there were two main tracks in the Ottoman Empire: the Madrasa and the Enderûn schools. The Madrasa was designated for Muslims and focused on educating scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. Financially supported by vakifs, it allowed children of economically disadvantaged families to advance in social levels and income. The second track, the Enderûn, was a free boarding school for Christian boys aged eight to twenty, recruited from the Balkans. Annually, 3,000 students were selected from Christian families through a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme), which indicates one boy from forty families in the settled communities in Rumelia or the Balkans.

In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \\"Fourteen Points\\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \\"les députés protestataires\\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg.

Information: - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint). - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features. - Didelphodon ( meaning \`\` two womb tooth '' ) is a genus of stagodont metatherians from the Late Cretaceous of North America . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya.

The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - Sparassodonta is an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be either a sister taxon to them, or considerably distantly related, part of a separate clade of Gondwanan metatherians. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \\"splendid isolation\\" during the Cenozoic; during this time they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \\"more competitive\\" placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids). - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937? is inside the article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United..., can you guess it ?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Paragraph: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.

The town has a close-knit community, and the diner is a popular spot for locals to gather and socialize. Step 3: Create a central conflict The central conflict of the story is whether Dana and Lauryn will develop a meaningful relationship outside of their customer-employee interactions at the diner. Step 4: Establish backstory Dana has been working at the diner for quite some time and has developed a close bond with many of the regular customers. She is well-liked, but she doesn't have many close friends outside of her workplace. Lauryn has been a loyal patron of the diner for years, but she recently experienced a major life event, such as a divorce or the loss of a loved one, that has left her feeling isolated and vulnerable. Step 5: Develop character arcs and relationships As the movie progresses, Dana and Lauryn begin to share more personal conversations during Lauryn's visits to the diner. They discover that they have a lot in common, and a supportive friendship develops between them. The two women must navigate their evolving relationship while balancing their roles at the diner and their own personal lives. Step 6: Introduce secondary characters Secondary characters include other diner employees and regular customers who offer support, humor, and wisdom as Dana and Lauryn's relationship deepens. These characters create a sense of community and help emphasize the importance of strong friendships and connections. Step 7: Create a climax The climax occurs when Dana and Lauryn face a significant challenge that tests the strength of their friendship, such as Dana being offered a job in another city that would force her to leave the diner and Lauryn. The two women must decide whether their bond is strong enough to withstand the distance or if they should prioritize their own individual paths. Step 8: Resolve the conflict Dana and Lauryn decide that their friendship is too valuable to risk and make the necessary sacrifices to remain in each other's lives. This might mean Dana turns down the job offer or Lauryn moves closer to Dana's new location. Together, they acknowledge that their connection goes beyond the diner and evolves into a lifelong bond. Step 9: Conclude the story The movie ends with a scene at the diner where Dana and Lauryn, along with the supporting cast of secondary characters, celebrate their friendship and commitment to one another. They reflect on the journey they've taken together and look forward to a future filled with support, love, and community. By following these steps, we have built a movie plot centered on the relationship between Dana and Lauryn and their connection to the diner, creating an engaging story about friendship, personal growth, and the power of community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Kenneth was hankering for some macaroni and cheese so he asked Logan to cook some for him because Choose your answer from: a. Kenneth did not know how to prepare it. b. Logan did not know how to prepare it.","completion":"Kenneth was hankering for some macaroni and cheese so he asked Logan to cook some for him because Kenneth did not know how to prepare it. Macaroni and cheese is a classic comfort food that is loved by many. It is a dish consisting of macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, usually created by combining a roux, milk, and cheese. In Kenneth's case, despite his love for this delicious dish, he never learned how to make it. Recognizing the importance of sharing a meal with loved ones, and understanding that the preparation process can be a gratifying experience, Kenneth decided to ask his friend, Logan, for some help in the kitchen. Logan, on the other hand, was a skilled cook with a wide range of culinary abilities, including the mastery of creating a decadent macaroni and cheese dish. He was flattered that Kenneth had asked him for help and agreed to lend a hand. Logan began by gathering all the necessary ingredients for the dish: macaroni pasta, butter, all-purpose flour, milk, and a blend of various cheeses, such as cheddar, mozzarella, and Monterey Jack. While boiling a pot of water for the macaroni, Logan took the time to educate Kenneth on each step of the cooking process. He started by demonstrating how to create a roux, which is a mixture of melted butter and flour that serves as the base for the sauce. He explained that the roux could be whisked into the milk to thicken the sauce – a crucial step for achieving a smooth and creamy macaroni and cheese dish. Once the roux was ready and the pasta perfectly al dente, Logan began incorporating the cheese into the sauce. He showed Kenneth the importance of adding the cheese gradually, allowing each portion to melt and blend before adding the next, to avoid clumping and unevenness. Meanwhile, Kenneth was tasked with grating the cheese and greasing a baking dish, adding an extra layer of culinary knowledge to his repertoire. As the dish was nearing completion, Logan decided to incorporate some optional ingredients, such as breadcrumbs, and a variety of herbs and spices to enhance the dish's flavor and texture. After seasoning the dish to perfection, Logan poured the cheesy pasta into the prepared baking dish and topped it with a generous layer of breadcrumbs. Then, he explained to Kenneth that baking the macaroni and cheese would create a golden, crisp crust that would contrast beautifully with the creamy interior. Once the dish was cooked to perfection, Logan and Kenneth sat down to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The entire process not only provided Kenneth with an opportunity to learn how to prepare a delicious macaroni and cheese dish but also helped strengthen the bond between the two friends, as they shared their love for food and newfound knowledge with each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"The individual you are referring to is Prince George, Duke of Kent, who was the fourth son of Queen Mary and King George V. He was born on December 20, 1902, and was the younger brother of King Edward VIII and King George VI. Prince George held the title of Duke of Kent and was known for his involvement in various public and military duties. On August 25, 1942, Prince George, Duke of Kent, tragically died in the Dunbeath Air Crash. At that time, he was a serving member of the Royal Air Force, holding the rank of Air Commodore. Prince George was on board a Royal Air Force Short S.25 Sunderland flying boat (Serial No. W4026) as a part of a non-operational flight from Invergordon, Scotland, to Reykjavik, Iceland. The aircraft was carrying personnel and equipment to the British base situated in Reykjavik.

The impact resulted in the loss of all but one of the 15 crew members and passengers on board, with Flight Sergeant Andrew Jack being the sole survivor. This tragic event marks one of the earliest high-profile aviation accidents involving a member of the British royal family, and it continues to be remembered as a significant historical incident.

Your potential photographers will bring along a portfolio of their pictures to the interview. It’s important that you spend plenty of time looking through this in detail with your partner. Ask the photographer to give some context for the pictures, including asking about the style used, and the type of wedding it was. The portfolio is a crucial document that gives you the best idea of what sort of style you photos will be getting. The pictures will have been carefully chosen to represent what the photographer considers her best work. Ask yourself if the pictures in the portfolio move you, or you think they capture the magic of the wedding. Be sure to ask if the production values on the pictures in the portfolio are the same as in the deal you are discussing. Spend some time looking back through the notes you made during the interview to help you decide. These notes are a record of the interview that can give you a good idea of the impression you got from the photographer. You can compare the scores across the different shortlisted candidates with your partner, and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. Price will no doubt be a factor in your decision, but try to think carefully about the value of these photos to you. It will be hard to value them quantitatively, as they are a record of the biggest day of your life, which you will always look back on. You will want a photographer that will capture the emotion of the day, as well as all the key moments. Some people recommend putting aside at least ten per cent of your wedding budget for the photos. Don’t rush the decision, and try to weigh up all of the different factors, including cost. You will use the interview in part to determine the technical skills and style of the photographer, but it is also an invaluable opportunity to assess her soft skills.

Keep in mind some basic questions, and discuss your response with your partner after the interview. Ask yourself simply if you liked the photographer.

However, without further context or information about the specific issues that the critic had with the film, it is difficult to determine the exact aspects that were considered negative. It could be that the storyline lacked coherence, or the acting and character development were insufficient, or even that the production values or direction fell short. Additionally, it is possible that the reviewer found some positive aspects but felt that the negative elements were more prominent and significantly impacted the movie-watching experience. In summary, based on the provided short movie review title, the critic likely had a negative perception of the film they were reviewing, possibly due to some significant shortcomings or errors in the movie's execution.

How can you tell who has viewed Instagram videos?","completion":"While these two questions have slightly different wording, they essentially have the same meaning: both are inquiring about how to discern who has viewed a specific video on Instagram. Given the core subject matter of these questions – understanding the viewership of Instagram videos – we can delve into a more detailed analysis of the process involved. 1. Instagram Stories: If you have shared your video through Instagram Stories, you can easily see the list of viewers for that particular story. Here's how: a. Open the Instagram app and navigate to your profile. b. Tap on the \\"Stories\\" icon, which should display your active stories. c. Swipe up on the story containing the video of interest. This action will reveal a list of all viewers for that specific story, along with the total view count. Note that this information is only available for 24 hours after first posting the video, as Instagram stories are temporary content. After the 24-hour window, the video will no longer be accessible to your audience. 2. Instagram Feed (Posts): If you have posted the video to your main Instagram feed, the process for identifying specific viewers is different and, unfortunately, not possible. Instagram does not provide this information for videos shared on your feed. However, you can still gather some insights about your video's performance: a. Open the Instagram app and navigate to the video post on your profile. b. Below the video, you should see both the number of likes and number of views it has received. Note that views represent the total times users have watched your video, while likes indicate direct engagement. c. By tapping on the number of likes, you can access a list of users who liked your post – while not inclusive of everyone who viewed it, this will offer a glimpse into your video's audience. 3. Instagram Insights: For business profiles and creator accounts, Instagram offers an analytics tool called \\"Insights.\\" This platform provides in-depth information about your account's performance, including engagement and reach metrics for your posts and stories: a. Open your Instagram profile and tap on the menu in the top-right corner, denoted by three horizontal lines. b. Select \\"Insights\\" from the menu. c. Explore the insights, paying particular attention to the sections for \\"Content\\" and \\"Audience.\\" While these features don't provide a list of specific users who viewed your videos, they offer valuable data for assessing your account activity and engagement levels with your audience. In conclusion, while the two original questions' phrasing differs, they both address the issue of discerning viewership for Instagram videos. As described, the process varies depending on whether the video in question is part of an Instagram story or a feed post. For more significant data analysis – specific to business or creator accounts – Instagram Insights can provide additional insights, though it still won't disclose the identities of specific viewers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Joseph Gilles Henri Villeneuve (French pronunciation: [Zil vilnoev]; January 18, 1950 - May 8, 1982), known as Gilles Villeneuve, was a Canadian racing driver. Villeneuve spent six years in Grand Prix racing with Ferrari, winning six races and widespread acclaim for his performances. An enthusiast of cars and fast driving from an early age, Villeneuve started his professional career in snowmobile racing in his native province of Quebec. Context: At the funeral in Berthierville former teammate Jody Scheckter delivered a simple eulogy: \\"I will miss Gilles for two reasons. First, he was the most genuine man I have ever known. Second, he was the fastest driver in the history of motor racing. But he has not gone. The memory of what he has done, what he achieved, will always be there.\\" Villeneuve is still remembered at Grand Prix races, especially those in Italy. At the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, the venue of the San Marino Grand Prix, a corner was named after him and a Canadian flag is painted on the third slot on the starting grid, from which he started his last race. There is also a bronze bust of him at the entrance to the Ferrari test track at Fiorano. At Zolder the corner where Villeneuve died has been turned into a chicane and named after him. The racetrack on Notre Dame Island, Montreal, host to the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, was named Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in his honour at the Canadian Grand Prix of 1982. His homeland has continued to honour him: In Berthierville a museum was opened in 1992 and a lifelike statue stands in a nearby park which was also named in his honour. Villeneuve was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame at their inaugural induction ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel, Toronto, Ontario on August 19, 1993. He was also inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. In June 1997 Canada issued a postage stamp in his honour. There is still a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books have been written about him. The number 27, the number of his Ferrari in 1981 and 1982, is still closely associated with him by fans. Jean Alesi, whose aggression and speed in the wet were compared to Villeneuve's, also used the number at Ferrari. Villeneuve's son, Jacques, drove the #27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used the number for occasional drives in NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing). A film based on the biography by Gerald Donaldson was announced in 2005, to be produced by Capri Films Inc, and with Christian Duguay named as the director, but the film has yet to materialise. Question: How else is he honoured? Answer:","completion":"Gilles Villeneuve is honored in many ways for his achievements and contributions to the world of racing.

How to get through the day with social anxiety In the morning, sit down with a piece of paper and write down what you're going to be doing and where you're going to be going that day. Do not avoid going places or doing things because you're worried of the outcome. It's very difficult, but facing your fears one-by-one will gradually make it easier.","completion":"One of the key aspects of dealing with social anxiety is to have a structured plan for the day and to follow tried-and-tested techniques to help you cope with the anxiety-inducing situations. Keeping in mind the aforementioned morning routine of writing down your daily activities, here is a detailed guide on how to get through the day with social anxiety: 1. Practice mindfulness meditation: Start your day with a 10-15 minute mindfulness meditation session. This will help ground you and prepare you for the day ahead. Mindfulness teaches you to be present in the moment and to accept your feelings without judgment. 2. Have a nourishing breakfast: Eating a healthy breakfast has been shown to improve mood and reduce anxiety levels. Choose a breakfast that is rich in protein, fiber, and essential nutrients to give your body and mind the best possible start to the day. 3. Plan your route and travel time: Anticipate potential triggers for your social anxiety by planning your route to work or school, and leaving ample time for travel. Having a clear plan can help reduce the stress of navigating through busy or unfamiliar environments. 4. Utilize relaxation techniques during the day: If you feel overwhelmed or anxious during the day, take a few minutes to practice deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization. These techniques can help decrease anxiety levels and improve your resilience to stressful situations. 5. Break tasks into smaller steps: Break down more significant tasks or activities into smaller, manageable steps. This can make them seem less daunting and provide you with a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step. 6. Use positive affirmations: Throughout the day, remind yourself of your accomplishments and positive traits. Having a list of affirmations can help keep your self-esteem stable and help you face challenging situations with more confidence. 7. Reach out to a support system: If you feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. It's essential to have a support system in place to help you navigate through difficult moments. 8. Be mindful of self-care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical and emotional well-being throughout the day. This includes getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, and engaging in enjoyable activities. 9. Practice exposure therapy: Gradually expose yourself to social situations that cause anxiety. This can help desensitize you to the triggers of social anxiety and build up your confidence in dealing with uncomfortable situations. 10. Reflect on the day and celebrate achievements: At the end of the day, take some time to reflect on what went well, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate your accomplishments. This process can help boost your self-esteem and give you motivation for the next day.

If But in recent years the tourist industry has extended the Cete westward to include popular family-style resorts like Saint-Rapha?«l and Sainte-Maxime and the glamorous Saint-Tropez., can we conclude that \\"The Cete was extended westward over a century ago.\\"?","completion":"While it might be tempting to conclude that \\"The Cete was extended westward over a century ago\\" based on the given information, there is insufficient evidence to support this claim. The statement provides an insight into the recent history of the tourist industry in the Cete region, mentioning that in recent years it has expanded westward. However, no specific timeline is provided to determine if this expansion happened precisely a century ago. To better understand the situation, let's analyze the different aspects of the statement, starting by defining the key terms and discussing the growth and development of the tourist industry in the Cete region. 1. The Cete: Traditionally, the Cete has been a popular coastal region located in the south of France, known for its stunning beaches, picturesque towns, and luxury tourism industry. It is often referred to as the French Riviera, or Côte d'Azur in French. 2. Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez: These are three coastal towns situated along the Mediterranean coast of the French Riviera. Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime are widely recognized for their family-friendly atmosphere, while Saint-Tropez is renowned for its glamour, attracting numerous celebrities, artists, and wealthy travelers. 3. Tourist industry expansion: The statement suggests that recent years have brought about changes in the tourist industry in the Cete region, with more focus given to the western part of the area. This shift has allowed popular resorts like Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez to flourish, showcasing the diversity that the French Riviera can offer to travelers. Based on this information, it is clear that there has been a westward expansion of the tourist industry in the Cete region. However, it is important to note that the statement refers to this expansion as a recent event, which indicates that it has occurred within the past few decades, rather than precisely a century ago. Without additional information regarding the exact timeline of this development, we cannot definitively conclude that the Cete was extended westward over a century ago. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the tourist industry along the French Riviera has evolved over time. While the region was initially known for its lavish resorts targeting the wealthy, it has made an effort to adapt to the changing demands of travelers, and now offers a wider variety of accommodations and experiences catering to various preferences and budgets. The inclusion of Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez as part of the larger Cete region exemplifies this trend. In conclusion, although the tourist industry in the Cete region has indeed expanded westward to include popular family-style resorts like Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime, and the glamorous Saint-Tropez, there is not enough information to support the claim that this extension took place over a century ago. A further exploration of the history of the French Riviera's tourist industry, along with a clear timeline of its development, would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Add 31*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -31*c term on the right side: 79*c - 1203 + 31*c = -31*c - 433 + 31*c (79 + 31) *c - 1203 = -433 110*c - 1203 = -433 2. Now, add 1203 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -1203 term on the left side: 110*c - 1203 + 1203 = -433 + 1203 110*c = 770 3.

Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. In the summer of 2004, Wayne's album Tha Carter was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes. In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature dreadlocks. Tha Carter gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single \\"Go DJ\\" became a Top 5 Hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. After the release of Tha Carter, Lil Wayne was featured in Destiny's Child's single \\"Soldier\\" with T.I., which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Tha Carter II, the follow-up to the original Tha Carter album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime Cash Money Records producer Mannie Fresh, who had since left the label. Tha Carter II sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \\"Fireman\\" became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included \\"Grown Man\\" with Currensy, \\"Hustler Musik\\", and \\"Shooter\\" with R&B singer Robin Thicke. Lil Wayne also appeared on a remix of Bobby Valentino's \\"Tell Me\\", which rose to No. 13 on the U.S. R&B Charts. In 2005, Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money. However, as of late 2007, Lil Wayne reported that he has stepped down from the management of both labels and has handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant. In 2006, Lil Wayne collaborated with rapper Birdman for the album Like Father, Like Son, whose first single \\"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\\", reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Does the word \\"quotation\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"quotation\\" does not mean the same thing in the two sentences provided. In this context, \\"quotation\\" has two different meanings. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each usage. 1. In the first sentence: \\"Let's get a quotation for repairing the roof before we decide whether it's worth doing.\\" In this context, \\"quotation\\" refers to a formal statement issued by a contractor or service provider, which outlines the services to be performed, the cost of labor and materials, and the timeframe for completion. In essence, a quotation is a document that provides detailed information about a job price and the scope of work involved. People often request quotations from multiple service providers when they are considering a project, so they can compare prices, services, and timelines before making a decision. In this sentence, the speaker is suggesting obtaining a quotation for repairing the roof to determine if it's a financially viable option. 2. In the second sentence: \\"Since he lacks originality, he must rely on quotation.\\" In this context, \\"quotation\\" refers to the act of using someone else's words, often a well-known phrase or expression, without altering or adding anything original. This type of quotation is common in writing, speeches, and conversation, where people draw upon the words of others to support, emphasize, or illustrate their points. However, when used excessively or in lieu of one's own thoughts and ideas, relying on quotations can imply a lack of creativity or originality. In summary, the word \\"quotation\\" has two different meanings in the given sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a formal document containing information about a job's cost and scope of work, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of using someone else's words as a means to convey a point or idea. These distinct meanings demonstrate the versatility and nuance of the English language, where a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The next giant leap for mankind is to reach another planet - specifically, Mars. The problem is that it's no easy task. The planet is 586 times further away from the Earth than the moon, and it'll take around 180 to 220 days to reach Mars, depending on where each planet is in its orbit. Such long periods in space have suggested many potential health problems, including hormonal changes, skin conditions, and muscle and bone deterioration . Here's where some furry friends come in. A wide range of animals have been in space, from fruit flies and spiders to cats, and dogs. Such experiments began as far back as the late 1940s in first tests to see if living things could _ the extreme g-force of a rocket launch. Mice continue to play a very important part in space experiments, mainly because the animals make excellent test subjects. They're small, which makes them inexpensive and easy to care for. In addition, their size and short life span make it possible to do the equivalent of several human years of tests in a much shorter time. Finally, because mice are mammals, they share many common characteristics with humans in terms of genetics, biology and behavior. Astromice have hit the headlines recently, as a team of scientists led by Betty Nusgens, professor of biology at the University of Liege in Belgium, found that the mice suffered a 15 percent thinning of their skin after 91 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This experiment was part of a wider NASA mission called the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The Italian Space Agency developed the facility, which allows six mice to be housed, monitored, and automatically fed and watered aboard the ISS, among which three survived during the mission. The mice have participated in 20 separate experiments, to study such effects as osteoporosis , anemia and heart health. Results for the 20 experiments are coming in...

Write a title for this article: LONDON — The topsy-turvy politics of Britain’s endlessly unpredictable summer took another stunning twist on Monday, with the selection by default of a prime minister who had advocated staying in the European Union but will now come under immediate pressure to fulfill her promise to lead the nation’s exit. Theresa May, the hard-charging home affairs secretary, was elevated to Britain’s top job when the woman who was to spend the summer campaigning against her, Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, preemptively dropped out of the contest to succeed outgoing leader David Cameron. With only one candidate left in the race, the 59-year-old May was named the winner by acclaim, a decision met with table-thumping approval by her fellow Tories in Parliament. She will take the keys to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, once Cameron has had a final turn in the weekly political combat session known as Prime Minister’s Questions. By coalescing around May, her Conservative Party avoided what could have been a bruising months-long campaign that threatened to inflame the still-raw wounds of last month’s E.U. referendum. But the move is also likely to accelerate the pressure on Britain to exit the E.U. European leaders have said Britain must act as quickly as possible to get out, as have Leadsom and other British advocates for a geopolitics-rattling divorce known as Brexit. On Wednesday, Theresa May will become Britain’s next prime minister. She'll become the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. Here's what you need to know her in 60 seconds. (Karla Adam,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) May campaigned — if only barely — for the country to stay inside the E.U. But after the “leave” campaign won last month’s referendum and forced the pro-“remain” Cameron from office, May pivoted and said she would back an exit — a stance she reiterated in her victory speech. “Brexit means Brexit, and we are going to make a success of it,” she said Monday afternoon as she stood in front of the gothic towers of Westminster and flashed a smile that is seldom seen on a politician known for her no-nonsense demeanor. [As Britain looks to new leader, a jolt of pressure to speed Brexit] May will become the country’s 76th prime minister, but only the second woman to hold the job following Margaret Thatcher, who stepped down over a quarter-century ago. Although May has been occasionally likened to Thatcher — Britain’s Iron Lady — she has lately been compared to a more contemporary leader: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both May and Merkel were born in the 1950s, the daughters of church pastors. They both inhabit the center-right of European politics but are also known for a strong pragmatic streak. Both are also considered tough negotiators — skills they’ll be putting to use against one another as May seeks a divorce deal with her soon-to-be-former E.U. counterparts. The key question now is when she triggers the start of those talks. She had earlier said she did not want to invoke Article 50 — the never-before-used mechanism for exiting the E.U. — until at least 2017. Her reluctance to move faster has sparked speculation that she might try to find a way to avoid Brexit — a possibility she emphatically rejected Monday, saying that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the E.U., no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, and no second referendum.” Monday’s events make it less likely that she can go back on that pledge, even if she wants to. In dropping out of the race, Leadsom emphasized that she was trying to clear a path for her erstwhile rival to get on with the business of Brexit. The two were supposed to campaign through the summer for the affection of the Conservative Party’s 150,000 members, with the winner due to be announced Sept. 9. [Meet Theresa May on her way to 10 Downing Street] But Leadsom, a relative unknown whose campaign got off to a rocky start after she touted her motherhood as an advantage in a matchup with the childless May, said Monday that she had concluded that “a nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable.” “Business needs certainty,” she said as she stood in front of a dark-brick townhouse in central London. Just last week, Leadsom had earned the right to square off against May in the summer contest by placing second — far behind May — among Conservative members of Parliament. May was considered a strong favorite to win, but Leadsom had vowed to wage a tough campaign. Her decision to drop out came as yet another shock in a country where such remarkable turnabouts have become a regular feature of politics. Since voting last month to leave the E.U. — the biggest stunner of all — Britain has watched mouth agape as politicians have double-crossed each other, scores have been settled and May has emerged from near the back of the pack of prime ministerial candidates to be the only woman left standing. By dropping out, Leadsom triggered a cascade of fast-moving developments. First, May’s former rivals lined up behind her. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who finished third in last week’s winnowing of candidates, quickly endorsed May on Monday. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and a one-time Leadsom backer. Hours later, Cameron walked out the front door of 10 Downing Street for one of the last times, and announced to reporters that he would yield to May by Wednesday. “I’m delighted that Theresa May will be the next prime minister. She is strong, she is competent, she is more than able to provide the leadership that our country is going to need in the years ahead, and she will have my full support,” Cameron said. Cameron said he would chair his last cabinet meeting Tuesday and would attend Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday for a final time as the nation’s leader, six years after he took the job. “After that, I expect to go to the palace and offer my resignation, so we will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,” he said. On his way back to Downing Street, the still-mic’d-up Cameron hummed a happy tune. A little over an hour later, in brief remarks beside cheering Conservative lawmakers outside Parliament, May promised to “steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain political and economic times.” May, who had raced back to London after a campaign event in Birmingham, appeared to have been caught off guard by Leadsom’s withdrawal — as was nearly everyone in British politics. [The rise of Theresa May highlights Brexit’s greatest irony] May will take office under the mandate that the Conservative Party gained in last year’s general election, having won a narrow majority in Parliament. But the abrupt end of the leadership contest deprives her of the explicit endorsement she was expected to receive from the party’s rank-and-file members. May had earlier said she believed that it was important that the party have a choice in its new leader and that she not take power through “a coronation.” Opposition parties quickly seized on the fact that voters hadn’t had the chance to pick May. The veteran politician is considered to the right of Cameron, having taken a hard line on issues such as immigration and government surveillance. “Tories now have no mandate,” tweeted Tim Farron, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, in a call for new elections. “Britain deserves better than this.” Politicians from the center-left Labour Party joined Farron’s call. But they did so as Labour continued its weeks-long implosion. Angela Eagle, a former top deputy of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, announced Monday that she would challenge Corbyn for his job. Dissidents within Labour, including Eagle, say Corbyn is ill-equipped to lead the party in a general election if the Conservatives decide to call one to renew their mandate. May has said there will be no new vote. But in a season of constant surprise, British political observers say not to rule it out.

Q:Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a \\"phasing\\" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation. Context: Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde was born in Deerfield, Illinois, to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. Of Jewish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were \\"something good to eat.\\" She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with Ororo Munroe. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school. Their conversation was cut short when they (along with Wolverine and Colossus) were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them. She managed to contact Cyclops, Phoenix, and Nightcrawler. With the help of Dazzler and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club. The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents. Kitty's parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club's men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends. All they knew was Kitty had left with Xavier's \\"students\\" to get a soda, there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up, and Kitty had been missing since. Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty's parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier. Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier's school with her parents' blessing, becoming the youngest member of the team. Question: What were her mutant powers Answer:","completion":"Kitty Pryde's mutant powers allow her to \\"phase\\" through solid objects. This means she, and anything or anyone she touches, can become see-through and pass through walls or other things like a ghost. Her powers also mess up electrical fields, like the power in a room, and let her pretend to float or levitate."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. and a hint : Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

This suggests that the user may not be entirely satisfied with the experience provided by the business. 5. The user wishes the establishment had good pizza since they live close by, showing a negative aspect of their review. 6. The user also mentions that they feel bad for those who consider this good pizza, further emphasizing their dissatisfaction with the food.

Military sources say the Syrian army now has \\"full control\\" after days of fighting backed by Russian air strikes. Meanwhile, Syria's antiquities chief said the damage to the ancient city was less than previously feared. \\"We were expecting the worst. But the landscape, in general, is in good shape,\\" Maamoun Abdulkarim told the AFP news agency. He said he felt \\"indescribable joy\\" that the city had not been completely destroyed. An on-the-ground assessment of the destruction will be carried out in coming days in order to develop restoration plans, Mr Abdulkarim said. More images of the damage caused by IS have emerged since Palmyra's recapture. President Assad said the recapture of Palmyra showed the success of the army's strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Mr Assad, a Kremlin spokesman said. The Kremlin said President Assad knew the Palmyra operation \\"would have been impossible without Russia's support\\". Why IS militants destroy ancient sites Palmyra and the logic of loss IS seized the Unesco World Heritage site and modern town in May 2015. Palmyra is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 400 IS fighters were killed in the battle for Palmyra. In a statement released on Saturday, Russia's defence ministry said its strikes hit 158 IS targets, killing more than 100 militants. This is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad, who wants to show the world that he is a partner in fighting terrorism. Backed by Russian war planes and Shia militias, government forces gained control over the ancient city and are now close to securing a vast area of the country. But residents and observers cast doubts on why Mr Assad's forces pulled out from Palmyra in the first place, allowing Islamic State militants to get in to the city. In May 2015, hundreds of IS fighters drove hundreds of kilometres across the desert to reach Palmyra, almost uninterrupted, while government forces were dropping barrel bombs over opposition areas full of civilians. President Assad has now secured a stronger position in the peace talks. He is certainly seen as a problem-solver, but many say he is the source of the problem. When IS seized the city it destroyed archaeological sites, drawing global outrage. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous.

Here is a question about this article: The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, which is an equivalent 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part of the federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defense; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015). What is the answer to this question: How much were expenditures estimated to be cut in agriculture and national defense in 2015?","completion":"In this given article, the estimated cut in expenditures in the areas of agriculture and national defense in 2015 is not directly provided in a numerical or percentage value. However, the article gives information that expenditures were reduced from 26.5% (in a year not directly mentioned) to an estimated 12.4% in the year 2015. To find the estimated reduction, you will need to subtract the final percentage (12.4%) from the initial percentage (26.5%). Follow these steps: 1. Use the information about the reduction of expenditures from 26.5% to an estimation of 12.4% in 2015. 2. Subtract the smaller percentage (12.4%) from the higher percentage (26.5%). Let's do the math: 26.5 (initial percentage) - 12.4 (final percentage) = 14.1 Therefore, the expenditures in agriculture and national defense were estimated to be cut by 14.1 percentage points in 2015.

In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

The Lenape (English: or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. New Amsterdam was founded in 1624 by the Dutch in what would later become New York City. Dutch settlers also founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware on June 3, 1631 and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short life, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company. In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock. After the warfare, the Lenape referred to the Susquehannock as \\"uncles.\\" The Iroquois added the Lenape to the Covenant Chain in 1676; the Lenape were tributary to the Five Nations (later Six) until 1753, shortly before the outbreak of the French and Indian War (a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe). The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur sources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. The Lenape who produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island temporarily forestalled the negative effects of the decline in trade. Lenape population fell sharply during this period, due to high fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity, as the diseases had arisen on the Asian continent and moved west into Europe, where they had become endemic in the cities. The Lenape had a culture in which the clan and family controlled property. Europeans often tried to contract for land with the tribal chiefs, confusing their culture with that of neighboring tribes such as the Iroquois. The Lenape would petition for grievances on the basis that not all their families had been recognized in the transaction (not that they wanted to \\"share\\" the land). After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. This land was purchased from the Lenape after the fact. In 1682, William Penn and Quaker colonists created the English colony of Pennsylvania beginning at the lower Delaware River. A peace treaty was negotiated between the newly arriving English and Lenape at what is now known as Penn Treaty Park. In the decades immediately following, some 20,000 new colonists arrived in the region, putting pressure on Lenape settlements and hunting grounds. Although Penn endeavored to live peaceably with the Lenape and to create a colony that would do the same, he also expected his authority and that of the colonial government to take precedence. His new colony effectively displaced many Lenape and forced others to adapt to new cultural demands. Penn gained a reputation for benevolence and tolerance, but his efforts resulted in more effective colonization of the ancestral Lenape homeland than previous ones.

The film was originally released in the US in 1980 as Goliathon . The film was directed by Ho Meng Hua and produced by Runme Shaw ; the special effects were directed by Sadamasa Arikawa , with Koichi Kawakita as assistant FX director . It starred Danny Lee and Evelyne Kraft . - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. - Homo erectus (meaning \\"upright man\\", from the Latin \\"rigere\\", \\"to put up, set upright\\") is an extinct species of hominid that lived throughout most of the Pleistocene geological epoch. Its earliest fossil evidence dates to 1.9 million years ago and the most recent to 70,000 years ago. It is generally thought that \\"H. erectus\\" originated in Africa and spread from there, migrating throughout Eurasia as far as Georgia, India, Sri Lanka, China and Indonesia. - Peking Man, \\"Homo erectus pekinensis\\" (formerly known by the junior synonym \\"Sinanthropus pekinensis\\"), is an example of \\"Homo erectus\\".

More than 2,000 referees - the majority at grassroots level - responded to questions about the abuse they receive and how well the Football Association's Respect programme is working. Nearly one in five said they had experienced physical abuse. \\"There is no room for complacency and we remain vigilant,\\" said the FA. It told the BBC: \\"More extreme incidents such as referee assaults thankfully remain few and far between. \\"Across an estimated 1.2 million games last season the number of reported incidents amounted to a tiny fraction of 1% - which puts the scale of the problem into context.\\" But Dr Jamie Cleland from the University of Loughborough, one of the academics involved in the research, warned: \\"These findings are quite concerning for the FA because without referees the grassroots game would not exist. \\"Referees are the bedrock of the amateur game because you need a referee to turn up in order for the match to go ahead and so these are a warning sign for the FA.\\" Case study: 'He threatened to kill me' The 5 live Investigates programme has been given exclusive access to the research, which was carried out by academics at Loughborough, Portsmouth and Edge Hill universities. A total of 2,026 referees across England, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey responded to the survey. Thirty-two percent are currently at Level 7 - junior referees aged 16 or over. The second biggest response, 30%, was from those at Level 5 - senior county referees. The survey also included a small number of responses from referees within the Football and Premier Leagues. Findings reveal that 22% experience verbal abuse at every match, while 38% said they were abused every couple of games. In addition, 19% had been the victim of physical abuse at some time. Donald Distin from Devon, who has been a referee for 15 years, was attacked by a player as he showed a red card during a game last year. \\"He just punched me. My feet left the ground and I was on the floor,\\" Mr Distin told the programme. \\"The bruising went all the way down through my chest and my face. My eye was bloodshot - it was horrific. I couldn't see my grandson because he was so upset.\\" The player was subsequently jailed over the attack. Mr Distin told the programme he still experiences abuse at matches. \\"I did a game the other day - it was a local derby and there were 10 cautions and two sending-offs. I sent someone off the field of play and he came towards me and said 'I'm going to kill you', as well as a load of expletives.\\" During the 2014-15 season there were 100 assaults on match officials and 374 incidents of improper conduct including physical contact and threatening and/or abusive language. Officials were also asked about the FA's Respect Programme which began seven years ago to improve behaviour among players and spectators. More than half, 54%, said the campaign had been successful. Comments included: \\"Respect levels, in general, have been very good from my experience. The knowledge of the Respect campaign has been good at most clubs.\\" Another said: \\"I referee adult football and there has been a marked improvement in behaviour. There are fewer incidents of irrational behaviour.\\" But nearly a third felt that the campaign had been unsuccessful. \\"What we've seen from within the data is a real outpouring of emotion from referees. They are saying that the campaign has been somewhat successful but they are then providing a diary-like analysis of the experiences that they are receiving if not at every match, every couple of matches,\\" added Dr Cleland. One official told the survey: \\"Behaviour of players and coaches has not improved in the slightest and all this shaking of hands pre-match is meaningless, totally meaningless.\\" Another added: \\"At the level I referee, I don't believe the Respect campaign has made much of a difference. The behaviour of players and spectators, shouting, swearing etc, if anything has got worse since I started refereeing.\\" An FA spokesperson told 5 live Investigates that \\"incidents of dissent are never pleasant and the notion that they are in any way part and parcel of the game is one that the Respect Programme was established to dispel\\". The spokesperson highlighted a 23% decline in dissent cautions over the past seven seasons and added: \\"With a significant drop in the occurrence of this type of caution over the life of the programme, it is clearly working.\\" But they also conceded that one serious assault is one too many. \\"The FA engages directly with referees through its own research and gave its support to the independent study which - when drilled down - indicates that only 7% of referees feel that Respect isn't working outright.\\" Summary:","completion":"A recent survey involving over 2,000 football referees found that 19% had experienced physical abuse, with the majority of respondents working at the grassroots level, raising concerns over the effectiveness of the Football Association's Respect programme."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I. negative; II. positive;).","completion":"I. Negative Movie Review: Ugh, I could barely sit through the film. I had high expectations after hearing so many people claim that I would be \\"blown away\\" by the intriguing plot, but it ended up being one of the most colossal disappointments I've ever encountered. To be honest, I am not entirely sure how anyone could find anything redeeming about this mess of a film. From the minute the opening credits rolled, I could tell that the production was going to be shoddy at best. The visuals were grainy, giving the impression the entire piece was haphazardly thrown together at the last minute. It's quite baffling to imagine that a movie with such a promising cast could be so poorly executed. Speaking of the cast, I was utterly confused by the mismatched ensemble of characters who were left to flounder in their half-baked roles. Their talents were criminally wasted in the screenplay, which seemed like it had been written by a first-time screenwriter rather than the seasoned professional the studio had hired. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and honestly, made me feel embarrassed for the actors. The plot was a convoluted mess that tried too hard to be edgy and mysterious but ended up becoming a tangled web of cliches and inexplicable twists. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, hoping that the movie would end soon - I hadn't been this bored in a theater in years. The pacing dragged on and on, with scenes that felt dull and uninspired. Moreover, the movie's attempts to incorporate deeper themes and social commentary came across as incoherent and heavy-handed, leaving me with the impression that the filmmakers were merely throwing ideas against the wall in hope that something would stick. Everything about the plot felt forced and artificial, as if the goal was simply to shock people rather than to provide a meaningful or thought-provoking experience. Finally, the ending was possibly the most disappointing part, trying to deliver a twist that was painfully predictable and unoriginal, with the last few minutes feeling both rushed and underwhelming. I left the theater feeling frustrated and let down, wondering how such a fantastic concept could have been so thoroughly squandered. In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well-crafted film experience, as it's a prime example of a missed opportunity that ends up wasting the audience's time and energy. The only positive takeaway I have is that I now have a new benchmark for true cinema failure. Disappointing, to say the least."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Article: It was a very different school from those in China. You're not met by imposing doors and concrete walls, and the buildings were inviting. On the front of the main building was inscribed \\"Lee Elementary School, 1904.\\" Wow! I knew it was an old school. Surrounding the main building were five trailers . One of them was my classroom, 5T. The \\"T\\" stood for Mrs. Toalson, my 5th grade teacher. Mrs Toalson showed me to my seat. A girl sitting at my table greeted me. Her name was Regina, and she was a blonde girl from Ukraine. Her eyes were like diamonds, and we had met at a party two days before. During my first morning, we had math class, PE and science. We didn't even have a break! I wondered why? Mrs Toalson said to us: \\"Guys, line up for the bathroom break please!\\" All the kids stood up and went outside. I didn't know what \\"bathroom break\\" meant. Was it break time? Lunch time? I was confused. Nevertheless, we followed Mrs. Toalson to the main building. We sat in the hallway across from the bathroom. In Chinese, \\"bathroom\\" means the WC, and a \\"break\\" means having a rest! Gosh, I thought that was weird and why did we have to go to the bathroom together? \\"Mary and Regina, you may go.\\" When we heard Mrs. Toalson, we went into the bathroom. The bathroom was clean, and it smelled like perfume. I asked Regina what if someone wanted to go to the bathroom during class time. She told me that there was a special pass called a \\"bathroom pass.\\" All you had to do was raise your hand with the pass to let Mrs. Toalson know you need to go to the bathroom. Then you would be permitted to go. At 3:30pm, school ended for the day. Students put their textbooks in their cabinets and lined up in front of the change room, where they collected their backpacks and coats. As they walked out of the door, each student said \\"Good bye\\" and gave Mrs. Toalson a high five. \\"Did you have a good day today?\\" Mrs. Toalson asked me as she hugged me goodbye. \\"Sure!\\" I nodded.

Step 3: If you are working indoors or on delicate surfaces, place some newspapers on top of the drop cloth to help absorb sloshed water, drips from the sponge, or wet bottoms of buckets. Step 4: Start by using a metal or glass broom to sweep away any loose soot from the bricks. This will help reduce the amount of soot you will need to clean, making the overall process easier. Step 5: Sprinkle a very fine grit sand onto the sooty areas, starting with a small amount to avoid a rough distribution. This will help further loosen the soot from the bricks, making it easier to clean. Step 6: Gently rub and scrub the sooty bricks with a sponge dampened in warm water. Apply gentle pressure and use circular motions to help lift and remove the soot from the bricks. Step 7: Rinse the sponge regularly as you work to keep it clean and effective in removing soot. Make sure to wring out excess water to prevent dripping and unnecessary water damage. Step 8: As you continue cleaning, inspect the bricks for any remaining soot or stains. If there is still soot present, repeat steps 5-7 until the bricks are clean.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Value added tax. Yes or no? Answer: The value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. Question: what is vat tax? A:","completion":"Yes, your description of Value Added Tax (VAT) is correct. VAT is a consumption tax applied to goods and services at each stage of the supply chain, where value is added. The amount of VAT charged is based on the sale price charged to the customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. It is collected by businesses and paid to the government. In more detail, VAT is a type of indirect tax levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution. The tax is ultimately borne by the end consumer. Businesses collect VAT on their sales, and they can also claim credits on VAT that has been levied on their purchases of materials and services required for their business activities. The rate of VAT varies depending on the country and the type of goods or services provided. Most countries have a standard VAT rate, but some items may be taxed at reduced rates or exempted from VAT. When a business sells a product or service, it charges the customer the price of the item and the appropriate VAT. The business then calculates the VAT it owes to the government by subtracting the VAT paid on its purchases from the VAT collected from its sales. The difference is the amount of VAT the business must pay to the government. In summary, Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied to the sale of goods and services throughout the supply chain, with businesses collecting the tax on behalf of the government. The VAT charged is based on the sale price of the product or service, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For now, they say, the Egypt-brokered de-escalation has merely placed a Band-Aid over a seeping wound, restoring the status quo established after Israel's Operation Cast Lead offensive of late 2008. Certainly, we may well see the return of airstrikes and rockets; the truce represents only a small first step toward a more durable solution. The nature of the agreement, however, points to a clear \\"Arab Spring truth\\" and a significant shift in regional dynamics: The international isolation of Hamas has ended. The influence exercised by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar was clearly instrumental in delivering this cease-fire. The role of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, in particular, has been praised by Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alike, with the latter commending Egypt's government for \\"assuming responsibility and leadership\\" in de-escalating the crisis. Toward the end of 2011, Hamas' departure from Damascus was sealed when Meshaal refused to denounce the uprising against his former host and sponsor, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With its regional base and Iranian funding in jeopardy, Hamas has increasingly turned to its fellow Sunni allies in Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. The degree of influence that this troika of Arab Spring playmakers has over Hamas' leaders, however, was revealed only by the recent crisis. The absence in negotiations of the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, was telling. It shows that in a post-revolution Middle East, engagement with Hamas on its own is both feasible and tempting. Opinion: How to prevent the next clash with Hamas. In this respect, however, the Egyptian president missed the opportunity to get Abbas and Meshaal working together and further stalled efforts at Palestinian unity. That is the demand of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians. To be sure, Iran still has an important role to play with Hamas. Alongside Egypt -- and, remarkably, the U.S. -- Meshaal recognized on Wednesday the importance of Iran's contribution to his movement's efforts (in the field of resistance, rather than resolution). He praised Tehran for providing the group with arms and financial support, despite \\"differences between Iran and Hamas on issues connected with the conflict in Syria.\\" In this respect, however, he is walking a fine line with his regional backers in order to keep his regional options open. It is worth remembering that Hamas is not a monolithic entity. Some within the movement are more focused on resistance, while others are focused on governance, reconciling with Fatah and reining in independent Gaza-based militants. This is something I heard privately in January 2011 in Gaza and subsequently when talking to some of Hamas' senior political officials. The international community -- and Israel -- should work with the newly emerged regional troika of Egypt-Turkey-Qatar to engage with Hamas and strengthen Hamas's pragmatic wing. Given the strength of its ties, though, Iran could still prove to be a spoiling influence. This initiative, as specified by Clinton, should focus on steps toward \\"a just and lasting peace.\\" Let us hope that the past week or so has renewed the Obama administration's drive to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace. In the short term, this means pushing for Palestinian unity around a negotiating position and ending the blockade on Gaza, both of which the Qatari emir stressed in his landmark trip to Gaza last month. The continuation of this blockade helps no one, and the destitution it imposes on Gazans has only further radicalized much of the largely young population. About 80% of Gaza's households live on less than 2 a day, while 1.3 million or 80% of its citizens receive some form of food aid. No wonder the U.N. recently declared that under current circumstances, the strip would be unlivable by 2020, citing shortages of food, water electricity, jobs, hospital beds and classrooms. Opinion: Israel, engage Abbas now. If such conditions continue, Hamas may well resort to further rocket attacks against Israel's southern communities or turn a blind eye to other groups launching such terror attacks. Groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the small but growing number of Salafi groups that have agreed to the cease-fire will pose a challenge to Hamas' authority, especially if there is no progress on the ground. These international efforts begin with the implementation of the admittedly shaky cease-fire. Egypt has emphasized the importance of effectively ending the blockade on Gaza -- one of the conditions of the cease-fire document. In the post-Cast Lead border arrangement, Israel retained significant veto powers over the passage of people and the flow of goods through Egypt's border crossings with Gaza. The new Egypt, however, has stressed the importance of formalizing the free flow of goods into and out of Gaza. In doing so, it wants to diminish the role of the \\"informal\\" tunnel economy, which, while generating large amounts of revenue for Hamas, has helped create an unstable situation in the Sinai badlands. If Israel now fails to deliver on its responsibilities regarding the conditions of the cease-fire, it risks not only a return to conflict but also losing the good will of Morsy.","completion":"Critics have argued that the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel has only served as a temporary solution, pointing to the unchanged reality on the ground. The truce is seen as a small first step towards a more durable solution, with the involvement of Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar highlighting a shift in regional dynamics. The international isolation of Hamas is now over, due in part to Egypt exercising its influence in delivering the cease-fire. The absence of the Palestinian Authority in negotiations shows that engaging with Hamas on its own is a possibility in a post-revolution Middle East. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy missed an opportunity to encourage Palestinian unity by not involving Abbas and Meshaal in the conflict resolution. Although Iran continues to play a crucial role in Hamas, the recent crisis revealed the limits of their influence, prompting Hamas to turn to regional Sunni allies in Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar. The international community is urged to work with Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar to engage Hamas and strengthen its pragmatic wing. Steps towards a \\"just and lasting peace\\" should prioritize achieving Palestinian unity and ending the blockade on Gaza. The continuation of the blockade further exacerbates the destitute conditions in Gaza, radicalizing the young population. If nothing changes, Hamas could resort to more rocket attacks against Israel or turn a blind eye to other groups engaging in terror attacks. In summary, the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel only provides a temporary solution to a deeply rooted conflict. Focusing on creating Palestinian unity, ending the blockade on Gaza, and working with regional powers such as Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar will be essential in seeking a long-lasting resolution for peace between the two sides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - James Hamilton Bachman (born 24 February 1972) is an English comedian, actor and writer.

In 2014 he co-starred in the film . - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - That Mitchell and Webb Look is a British sketch comedy television show starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Channel Four Television Corporation (informally Channel Four) is a publicly owned media company headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

Great 3 day weekend! Now back to the grind! What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as a combination of positive and neutral emotions. Let's break it down into parts to provide a more detailed analysis of the sentiment. 1. \\"Great 3 day weekend!\\" - Positive Sentiment This part of the tweet expresses the user's enjoyment and satisfaction with the extended weekend. The term \\"great\\" is an affirmative adjective, which denotes that the user experienced a good time over the weekend. A three-day weekend typically refers to having an additional day off from work or school, giving more time for relaxation, leisure, or personal activities. Therefore, this part of the tweet showcases the user's positive experience and appreciation of the extended weekend. 2. \\"Now back to the grind!\\" - Neutral Sentiment This part of the tweet suggests a return to routine responsibilities following the three-day break. The word \\"grind\\" is often used informally to describe everyday tasks, work, or school, which can be repetitive or require continuous effort. While not necessarily negative, this statement implies that the user acknowledges and accepts the need to return to their regular obligations, which might not be as enjoyable or relaxing as their weekend. Although this expression may not fully convey enthusiasm, it doesn't project negativity or reluctance either. Thus, this portion of the tweet can be interpreted as neutral in sentiment.

OPTIONS: (a). prepare himself being upset (b). ready himself being confident (c). figure out where to take jan on a date Q: I heard that Jordan found Jan's slick back hair attractive, so he asked her out. And I was wondering What does Jordan need to do before this? A:","completion":"Before Jordan embarks on the journey of asking Jan out, based on her fondness for his slick back hair, there are several key steps he must take to ensure the best possible outcome. While options (a), (b), and (c) are all valid factors, let's break this down further: 1. Self-reflection: Before even approaching Jan, Jordan must conduct a self-assessment, determining his qualities, genuine intentions, and feelings for her. This will lay the groundwork for effective communication and ascertain that he is making this decision for the right reasons. 2. Confidence building: Aligning with option (b), Jordan should ready himself by being confident. This entails looking within himself and understanding his self-worth, highlighting his strengths, and being attentive to his appearance (including maintaining that slick back hair). Portraying self-assuredness often leaves a positive impact on others. 3. Gathering information: Jordan should engage in friendly conversations with Jan or mutual friends to gather insights about her likes, dislikes, and interests. This will aid in customizing his approach when asking her out, ensuring that the interaction is tailored specifically for her. It also demonstrates a genuine interest in Jan as he wants to know about her preferences. 4. Planning the encounter: Option (c) is crucial for making a great first impression when Jordan eventually asks Jan on a date. Jordan must consider various factors when planning the date, such as the level of intimacy desired, the location, recreational activities, and the overall atmosphere. Successful planning would entail selecting a place that perfectly balances Jan's interests and preferences, as well as leaving room for engaging conversation. 5. Practicing the proposal: Jordan should rehearse his approach to asking Jan out. The practice will not only boost his confidence but also help him refine his delivery. Jordan must aim to be genuine and enthusiastic to draw a positive response. 6. Preparing for different outcomes: As option (a) suggests, Jordan must be emotionally prepared for various responses from Jan. Despite mustering self-confidence and planning, there is always a possibility of rejection. In such cases, it is essential to be respectful and maintain composure. Jordan should accept the outcome gracefully and remind himself that a rejection is not a reflection of his self-worth. 7. Timing: Finally, choosing the right moment to ask Jan out is essential. Discerning when Jan is relaxed and open to conversation will increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. In conclusion, Jordan must execute several steps in preparation for asking Jan out. These steps encompass elements of self-reflection, confidence-building, gathering information, planning, practicing, preparing for different outcomes, and selecting the timing. By doing so, Jordan will maximize his chances of success while demonstrating genuine interest and respect towards Jan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. I am facing a new situation today: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beaker's particles are moving slower?","completion":"To answer the question correctly, we should consider the information from the background article and apply it to the new situation. Step by step, our thought process should be: 1. The background article states that when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. 2. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, which causes them to move faster. 3. In the new situation, there are two beakers with identical chemical compounds: Beaker A on a low-temperature burner and Beaker X on a high-temperature burner. 4. Based on the information from the background article, the particles in Beaker X, which is on the high-temperature burner, are moving faster due to their higher energy. 5. Since the particles in Beaker X are moving faster, this implies that the particles in Beaker A (on the low-temperature burner) are moving slower in comparison. So, to answer the question correctly: The particles in Beaker A are moving slower because it is on a low-temperature burner, resulting in lower energy and slower movement compared to Beaker X, which is on a high-temperature burner."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of... Question: Why was the kantharos dedicated to the twin sons of Zeus?

He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws.

His centre-right Fidesz has polled 45%, with most of the votes counted. A centre-left opposition alliance is trailing with 25%, while the far-right Jobbik party is credited with 21%. The Hungarian left has never fully recovered from its heavy defeat in the 2010 ballot, in which Mr Orban swept to power with a two-thirds majority. Sunday's election has been mainly fought over the state of the economy, correspondents say. \\"No doubt we have won,\\" Mr Orban told supporters gathered in the capital, Budapest, late on Sunday evening. \\"This was not just any odd victory. We have scored such a comprehensive victory, the significance of which we cannot yet fully grasp tonight.\\" He said the election results showed that Hungarians wanted to stay in the European Union, but with a strong national government. \\"I'm going to work every day so that Hungary will be a wonderful place,\\" he declared. Fidesz is predicted to win around 135 of the 199 seats in parliament. It now also seems likely that Jobbik will become the second-largest party in parliament, the BBC's Nick Thorpe reports from Budapest. Although the Socialist-led opposition is in second place, the five parties making up the alliance plan to form their own factions after the elections, our correspondent says. Observers say Jobbik's adoption of a softer image has paid dividends, as a recent opinion poll found leader Gabor Vona to be the most popular opposition politician. Fidesz supporters say Mr Orban's victory is a tribute to his leadership powers. But opposition parties have accused the prime minister throughout their campaign of undermining Hungarian democracy.

News article: John Edwards trial begins Monday with opening statements (Chuck Burton / Associated Press) GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Opening statements are set for today in the trial of former presidential candidate John Edwards, as federal prosecutors try to prove that more than 900,000 paid to Edwards by two wealthy benefactors during his run for the White House should have been reported as campaign contributions because the money flowed to his mistress to preserve Edwards' image as a \\"family first\\" candidate. Edwards' defense team is expected to argue that the payments were gifts from wealthy friends and the money was used for expenses unrelated to the 2008 campaign. The fact that Edwards paid his mistress, campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, and helped her through the birth of a child fathered by the candidate, does not mean Edwards had to declare the gifts as campaign contributions, his lawyers say. Edwardsâ lawyers contend that the government's case requires the jury to accept a novel interpretation of a campaign finance law that âhas never been the basis of criminal or even civil liability in the statute's history.ââ The defense also plans to call two former FEC commissioners to the stand, who are expected to testify that, under the law at the time the money was paid to Edwards, it was not clear that it had to be classified as a campaign contribution. Campaign finance experts have said that the violations at issue have been previously handled as civil penalties, resulting in fines and payback requirements for the offending candidates. âThis case is significant both legally and politically,ââ said Kenneth Gross, a Washington ethics lawyer. âThis is the first criminal case dealing with an excessive gift, particularly a gift not ever going to a campaign, and spent for purposes seemingly unrelated to a campaign.ââ Prosecutors contend that bills paid by two Edwards benefactors, Rachel âBunnyââ Mellon, a banking heiress from Virginia, and the late Fred Baron, a Texas lawyer, actually were campaign donations because they were intended to protect Edwards' candidacy, which would have been derailed had the public learned of the affair. âThe charges against John Edwards in this case flow from his knowing and willful violation of the federal campaign finance laws during his campaign for the Democratic Partyâs nomination for president,ââ prosecutors said in court filings. Justice Department prosecutors contend this is a straightforward case of broken campaign finance laws: âA federal candidate may only accept and receive a limited amount of money from any one individual during an election cycle, and he must truthfully report the money he accepts and receives,ââ the department said in a trial brief. The former senator from North Carolina has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations. If convicted of all charges, Edwards faces up to 30 years in prison and 1.5 million in fines. Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Monday morning and the much-anticipated trial is expected to last at least six weeks. Critics of the prosecution, while noting that Edwards' conduct was reprehensible, argue that the government is going too far in trying to tie a candidate's personal life to complex campaign finance laws. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group that generally supports the Justice Department against politicians charged with corruption, took the unusual step of criticizing prosecutors for pursuing the case. The group contends that the payments were gifts, not campaign contributions, noting that the payments continued after Edwards ended his campaign. The group cited a 2002 Federal Election Commission decision in which six commissioners unanimously agreed that a loan made to a congressman to help defray the costs of his divorce was not a campaign contribution because the donor and the politician “had a preexisting personal relationship.” The same precedent should apply to Edwards, the group said, because the money came from friends. “Sen. Edwards’ conduct was despicable and deserves society’s condemnation, but that alone does not provide solid grounds for a criminal case,” the group said in a statement last year. The trial is starting about a year and a half after Edwards’ wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer. Edwards carried on the affair with Hunter while his wife was terminally ill. Edwards’ defense team has suggested that he did not know about the money from Mellon and Baron. “The government assumes that Mr. Edwards knew about the monies; the evidence will prove otherwise,’’ his attorneys said in a court filing. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about a trial of a man named John Edwards, who used to be a candidate to become the leader of the United States. The trial is about whether more than 900,000 given to him by two rich friends should have been reported as campaign contributions. This means that prosecutors, the people trying to prove he did something wrong, think that he should have told everyone about the money because it was used to help hide his secret girlfriend and make him look like a good \\"family first\\" person. John Edwards and his lawyers say the money was a gift from friends and not related to his campaign. They also say that even if he used the money to pay his secret girlfriend and a baby he had with her, it doesn't mean he had to report it as campaign money. This is the first case like this ever, and some people think it's important because it could change how other similar cases are treated in the future. If John Edwards is found guilty, he could be in prison for up to 30 years and might have to pay as much as 1.5 million. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks. Some people believe the government is trying too hard to connect his personal life with campaign laws and that he shouldn't be in trouble for this."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Powell boys suffered 'chop injuries' to neck and head GRAHAM, Wash. -- Gallons of gasoline spread throughout the home of Josh Powell caused the inferno that destroyed his home Sunday, authorities said Monday evening, but his two young sons, Charlie and Braden, also suffered from what investigators described as \\"chop injuries\\" to their heads or necks. Autopsies on the three bodies were completed late Monday, confirming that the boys died as a result of homicide, and Josh Powell died as a result of suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning. The Pierce County Medical Examiner confirmed Charlie Powell, 5, died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but a chop injury to his neck was a contributing factor. Braden Powell, 7, died in the same manner, but sufferred a chop injury to the neck and head. Investigators recovered a hatchet that they believe was used on the boys. Detectives called the explosion a \\"deliberate, planned event\\" in which two five-gallon cans of gasoline were used as an accelerant to blast the home apart; gas from one can was spread around the house, and the other can was apparently ignited in the center of the house, where the bodies of Josh, Charlie and Braden were found. The house burst into flames after a social worker brought the boys there for a supervised visit. Powell blocked the social worker from entering the house. Investigation shifts to Josh Powell's father The Sunday blaze at Powell's home brought yet another twist in the very public scandal and investigation that began when Josh's wife, Susan Powell, vanished from the family's Utah home in 2009. The investigation now shifts to Josh's father, Steven Powell, who is currently jailed on voyerism and child pornography charges and has refused to be interviewed since the explosion. Last fall, detectives found images and video of neighborhood girls, as well as Susan Powell, in his possession. Steven has been named a person of interest in her disappearance. Susan's parents believe Steven Powell holds the key to finding out what really happened to their daughter. \\"I think he is the only one who would know. I think Josh would have confided in him enough to know where she might be,\\" said Chuck Cox. \\"He's not going to tell us anything.\\" \\"It's up to the police,\\" said Judy Cox. Steven Powell claimed he and Susan had a romantic relationship, but detectives said Monday those statements are \\"a flat out lie,\\" and that Susan viewed her father-in-law as a \\"creep, and weird.\\" Steven Powell has been put on suicide watch. Investigators have not said when they planned to speak to him. Emails from Josh Powell found Multiple emails from Josh Powell have since been found in close family members' in-boxes, including his cousins, and his pastor. Details of those emails have not been made explicitly clear, except that they included goodbyes and how to take care of any final business. INTERACTIVE: Review the entire Powell case from the beginning All of the emails were sent minutes before the social worker showed up at Powell's home with his sons Sunday afternoon for a court-ordered visitation. Detectives said more evidence has emerged about Josh Powell's actions leading up to Sunday's blast, such as taking the boys' toys and books to Goodwill. The deaths of Powell and the two boys brings an end to a case that started in December, 2009, when Josh's wife Susan went missing in the Utah desert. Her body has still not been found. Attorneys for Susan's parents have said recently the boys had begun to talk about what happened the night their mother went missing, saying, \\"Mommy was in the trunk.\\" Josh maintained he and the boys went camping the night Susan disappeared, around 12:30 a.m. However, detectives said Monday despite all of the evidence found so far at the scene, none of it has had anything to do with the disappearance of Susan. ||||| Susan Powell's Dad: Our Worst Fears Came True Chuck Cox says that the family told anybody who would listen: It was only a matter of time before his son-in-law Josh Powell killed himself and his two boys.On Sunday, those worst fears were realized when Josh, long a person of interest in the disappearance of wife Susan Powell, blew up his Tacoma, Wash.-area house in what is being characterized as a double-murder suicide.\\"We stated our fear many times, that if he was feeling desperate, that he would possibly kill himself and the boys, that this kind of thing could happen,\\" Susan's father Chuck tells PEOPLE. \\"If he felt there was no way out, that he wouldn't let anyone else have them. They were possessions to him.\\"As Josh tangled with Susan's relatives over the boys, Charlie, 7, and Branden, 5, Cox says he relayed his concerns to his attorney, to the court, to the county sheriff, to family services officials.\\"They were all aware of our fears – that he would take a cowardly way out,\\" says Cox.Powell, who had denied wrongdoing in his wife's disappearance, had been fighting to regain custody of their boys, who were being cared for by their maternal grandparents.A judge had recently ordered Powell, whose father is the subject of a child pornography case , to undergo a psychosexual evaluation, according to reports. ||||| Originally published February 6, 2012 at 1:56 PM | Page modified February 7, 2012 at 8:56 PM Charlie and Braden Powell's grandparents said Monday the boys hadn't wanted to go visit their father, and described an ominous drawing the younger boy had made. Powell's voicemail: 'I am not able to go on' Commenting has been disabled because of the sensitive nature of this story. Josh Powell's final, horrific act — killing his sons and himself in a fiery inferno — was tantamount to a confession to his wife's disappearance and presumed death, according to the Pierce County prosecuting attorney. \\"If there was any doubt about who murdered Susan Powell, it's gone now,\\" Mark Lindquist said. On Sunday, when Powell attacked his two sons with a hatchet and then set fire to his Graham rental home, he had long been considered by Utah police to be a person of interest in his wife's December 2009 disappearance. But charges had never been brought against him despite questions over his claims that his wife went missing after he took his two sons camping in the middle of the night in freezing temperatures. Despite Powell's death, police in West Valley City, Utah, say the investigation into Susan Powell's disappearance will continue. Lindquist's reference to Susan Powell's presumed slaying isn't the first time authorities indicated they believe the missing mother of two was the victim of homicide. A search warrant obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request Tuesday shows that police in Utah were investigating three felonies in connection with the case: first-degree murder, kidnapping and obstructing a public servant. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill acknowledged for the first time that they believe Powell is likely dead, but said the case remains a missing persons probe for now. Gill wouldn't discuss the evidence, but said authorities don't have enough information to file charges in the case. \\"I think when I talk about it as a missing persons case, that's because we haven't located the body of Susan Powell,\\" Gill said in an interview with the AP. \\"Do we think that she may have met harm? Sure.\\" Investigators are now reassessing the case after her husband, Josh Powell, killed their sons Charlie, 7, and Braden, 5, during a court-ordered visit Sunday at his Graham home. The boys' grandparents, Chuck and Judy Cox, say the boys were reluctant to go on the visit. But the visits were court-ordered after Josh Powell lost custody of the boys in the fall, and the Coxes insisted they go. \\"They liked seeing their dad,\\" Chuck Cox said. \\"But the last time they didn't want to go.\\" It was during Sunday's visit that the sheriff's office says Josh Powell set fire to the rental home in Graham, killing both boys and himself moments after a state-contracted caseworker brought them for the supervised visitation. Sheriff's officials said Monday they believed Josh Powell had planned the deadly fire for some time. They said he dropped off toys and books at Goodwill over the weekend and sent final emails to friends and acquaintances shortly before the blaze. Detectives found evidence of 10 gallons of gasoline inside the home, said sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Ed Troyer. Gasoline from a 5-gallon can was spread throughout the house and used as an accelerant for the huge blaze. Another 5-gallon can was found near the bodies, he said Troyer called the deadly fire \\"a deliberate, planned-out event.\\" Chillingly, Powell may have first incapacitated his sons by attacking them with a hatchet. The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office on Monday said all three died from smoke inhalation. But both boys also suffered \\"chop injuries,\\" Braden to his head and neck, and Charlie to his neck. Troyer said a hatchet was recovered near the bodies. \\"Just when you thought it couldn't get any grimmer, you learn he had assaulted his kids with an ax,\\" Lindquist said. In the emails sent before the fire, Powell wrote his lawyer, pastor, friends and relatives, telling some, \\"I'm sorry. I can't live without my boys.\\" He also left instructions on how to take care of his \\"final business,\\" according to Troyer. He said none of the emails mentioned Powell's wife and the mother of the boys, Susan Powell, 28, who has been missing since December 2009. Powell had long been considered a person of interest in her disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah. On Monday, a tearful Chuck and Judy Cox spoke of their family's pain over the boys' deaths, compounded by the disappearance of their daughter. Powell, 36, told police he last saw Susan around midnight Dec. 7, 2009, when he put their sons in a minivan and took them on a late-night camping trip in Utah's west desert in freezing temperatures. But police, almost from the start, questioned Powell's story. Powell later moved back to the Puyallup area, where both his father and Susan Powell's parents live. The Coxes on Monday also spoke about a drawing Braden had made showing the family of three riding in their minivan. Braden said the drawing was of the two boys and their father. When asked why their mother wasn't in the drawing, Braden said she was in the trunk, Chuck Cox said. Cox recalled that the boy said, \\"Mommy and Daddy got out but Mommy didn't come back.\\" At the time of their mother's disappearance, Braden was 2 and Charles was 4. Anne Bremner, an attorney for the Coxes, said as recently as Christmas the boys told their grandparents \\"mommy's in the mine.\\" Police in Utah had searched abandoned mine shafts in Nevada last summer, but found no sign of Susan Powell. The Coxes said the drawing of the minivan was given to police in West Valley City, who are investigating the disappearance of Susan Powell. Buzz Nielsen, chief of the West Valley Police Department, declined to comment Monday on the drawing or any other specific evidence in the Susan Powell case. Nielsen, who flew to Washington on Monday, said that investigators have been working on building a case against Powell with \\"strong circumstantial evidence.\\" He said he had hoped to see charges filed later this year. Nielsen said Powell was not aware of the progress of the investigation. He speculated that Powell's decision to take his life and kill his children was not sparked by fear of arrest. He said Powell's death will not stop investigators from trying to piece together what happened to Susan Powell. Nielsen said his detectives will try to speak with Josh's father, Steven Powell, whose arrest last September on child-pornography and voyeurism charges prompted the state to take custody of Charlie and Braden. The boys and their father had lived with Steven Powell, who remains in custody in Pierce County Jail. He described Steve Powell as another \\"person of interest,\\" but noted the elder Powell is \\"not in our sights\\" in terms of any potentially imminent arrest. About noon Sunday, a state contract worker from Foster Care Resource Network brought the boys for a scheduled visit to Powell's Graham house. The caseworker was assigned to the children and had previously brought them to their father without incident, Troyer said. Powell answered the door, pulled the boys inside, slammed the door and locked it, Troyer said. Denied entry, the caseworker immediately began banging on the home's doors and windows and called 911. She told police she thought she smelled gasoline. The caseworker reported the fire started within seconds, Troyer said. On Monday, the Coxes took reporters into an addition they had built on their Puyallup home to make room for their grandchildren. The room had two small beds with handmade quilts, one decorated with characters from the movie \\"Cars\\" and the other with Spider-Man. Toys were stacked in a nearby room. They talked about how the boys had been emotionally distant when they arrived in September. They'd been shunned by other children, Chuck Cox said, because people disliked or mistrusted their father. \\"They said that in their old school, the other kids walked 10 feet in front of them or 10 behind them,\\" he said. When they talked about their mother initially, they called her \\"Susan,\\" Cox said. But Cox said he knew they were making progress when Charlie pointed to a smiling picture of his mother in the living room and asked his grandpa to take a picture of him next to the photo. \\"He said, 'I'm sitting with my mommy.' \\" Christine Clarridge: 206-464-8983 or cclarridge@seattletimes.com Seattle Times staff reporters Jennifer Sullivan, Katherine Long and Steve Miletich contributed to this report, which includes information from The Associated Press. |||||Summary:","completion":"A very sad thing happened where a man named Josh Powell hurt his two young sons, Charlie and Braden, with a tool called a hatchet and then caused a big fire in their home.

Mary should buy some flowers some bread.","completion":"The sentence \\"Mary should buy some flowers some bread\\" is not linguistically acceptable, as it lacks grammatical structure and clarity. For a sentence to be considered linguistically acceptable, it must adhere to the rules of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics applicable to the language in question. In the case of the given sentence, there are several issues that make it unacceptable: 1. Lack of Coordination or Punctuation: There is an absence of conjunction like \\"and\\" to link the two phrases \\"some flowers\\" and \\"some bread.\\" Additionally, there is no punctuation to separate the two phrases adequately. 2. Ambiguity: The sentence has an ambiguous meaning due to the lack of coordination or punctuation, which makes it difficult to derive any coherent meaning from it. 3. Syntax: The sentence is syntactically incorrect because of the absence of proper conjunctions or punctuation, resulting in ambiguous phrases that do not form a coherent clause. 4. Semantics: The sentence is semantically flawed since the intended meaning is unclear due to the lack of proper grammatical structures and ambiguous phrasing. To make the sentence linguistically acceptable, a proper conjunction or punctuation must be applied to clarify its meaning and adhere to the rules of grammar and syntax. Here are a few examples of corrected sentences: 1. \\"Mary should buy some flowers and some bread.\\" In this version, the conjunction \\"and\\" is used to link the two phrases, addressing the issues of coordination, ambiguity, and syntax while conveying a clear meaning. 2. \\"Mary should buy some flowers; some bread.\\" Using a semicolon provides an appropriate punctuation to separate the two phrases and effectively conveys that these are two separate yet related items Mary needs to purchase. 3. \\"Mary should buy some flowers. She should also buy some bread.\\" By separating the ideas into two sentences, we can maintain coherence and clarity while effectively communicating the intended meaning. In summary, the original sentence is not linguistically acceptable due to issues with coordination, ambiguity, syntax, and semantics. By introducing a proper conjunction or punctuation, we can correct these issues and create a clear, coherent, and linguistically acceptable sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which reservior would most likely have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B? There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","completion":"Reservoir A would most likely have excellent water quality. The paragraph provides a number of clues to support this conclusion. Firstly, reservoir A has an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoir, while reservoir B does not. This means that reservoir A receives proper care and oversight to ensure its water quality, while reservoir B is left without proper regulation. The hint provided also indicates that water levels are lowered in the fall to prevent damage from ice and maintain excellent water quality. Since the engineer for reservoir A carries out this process, it can be inferred that reservoir A benefits from this seasonal regulation, leading to better water quality. On the other hand, reservoir B has not had its water level regulated in the fall due to the lack of an engineer, which suggests that it's at higher risk of ice damage, as well as potentially having worse water quality as a significant portion of the water is not being replaced. In conclusion, based on the presence of an engineer for reservoir A and the resulting regulation of water levels, as well as the paragraph's indication that this process leads to excellent water quality, reservoir A would most likely have better water quality than reservoir B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment we walked through the doors, every aspect of our visit exceeded our expectations and left a lasting impression. As we entered the bistro, we were greeted with warmth and genuine smiles from the friendly staff. The hostess promptly showed us to our reserved table, which was thoughtfully arranged on the outdoor patio section, as we had requested during the reservation. Surrounded by lush greenery and a calming water feature, the ambiance was serene and welcoming, setting the stage for a memorable night. One of the many highlights of the evening was the extensive and diverse menu. Not only did they cater to various dietary preferences, but they also put a creative spin on classic dishes. Everything was so inviting, and it took us a good while to finally decide on our orders! The Garden Bistro offered a perfect fusion of culinary delights, including vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options – a thoughtful consideration for customers with specific requirements. Our server, Emily, was an absolute gem. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and more than happy to provide well-informed recommendations based on our preferences. Her passion for her workplace's cuisine and her attention to detail were evident throughout our visit. She checked on us periodically, ensuring our experience met our satisfaction and swiftly attending to any requests. The food, without a doubt, was beyond delicious. Every dish we ordered was beautifully plated, colorful, and bursting with flavors. We started with the crispy zucchini blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, which had a perfect balance between the delicate, tender zucchini and the flavorful, slightly tangy ricotta cheese. For the main course, I opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, served on a bed of sautéed kale and wild mushroom risotto. The fish was cooked to perfection – flaky, moist, and infused with a delightful, subtle citrus flair. My friends were equally impressed with their dishes: a delightful Thai green curry and a scrumptious truffle oil-infused mushroom pasta. Despite being satiated from our meal, we couldn't resist trying their impressive dessert selection. We shared the deconstructed tiramisu and the passion fruit cheesecake. Not only were they visually stunning, but they tasted divine, providing a wonderful end to an incredible meal. In addition to the exquisite food and top-notch service, The Garden Bistro also impressed us with their excellent attention to hygiene and current health guidelines. The staff frequently sanitized surfaces, politely reminded guests to wear masks when necessary, and ensured that social distancing was maintained. These measures made us feel at ease as we enjoyed our dining experience. The artisanal cuisine, the vibrant and calming atmosphere, and the commendable staff at The Garden Bistro have surely won us over as loyal patrons.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - severe - harsh - hard - strict - self denying The answer is:","completion":"self-denying. The punishment for someone who is over-indulgent can be described as self-denying, since it requires a change in one's behavior and attitude in order to curb the excessive indulgence. It is important to understand that the concept of punishment can vary depending on the specific context and situation in which the over-indulgent behavior is taking place. In some cases, it could be the individual themselves who wishes to impose a level of control or restraint, while in other situations it could be an authority figure or a social norm that dictates the need for a more disciplined and moderate approach. A self-denying punishment demands a considerable amount of self-control and restraint, as it often involves giving up on desires that provide immediate gratification. This can be seen as a difficult and constant struggle, but it can also lead to a greater sense of self-awareness, self-discipline, and appreciation for a balanced lifestyle. Self-denial can also help individuals avoid the negative consequences of over-indulgence, which can include addiction, financial strain, health problems, or damaged relationships. While the other options – severe, harsh, hard, and strict – might suggest an imposition of punishment from an external source or authority, they may not necessarily provide the best guidance for an individual who continually engages in over-indulgent behavior. Punishments that are perceived as too severe or harsh could potentially lead to resentment or resistance, further fueling the cycle of indulgence. In contrast, choosing the act of self-denial as a way to reevaluate and modify one's behavior may bring about lasting change, and help individuals develop healthier habits and coping mechanisms. When a person takes responsibility for their own actions, they are more likely to feel a sense of ownership and agency in their transformation. Additionally, self-denial allows room for growth and learning, as it encourages reflection, introspection, and mindfulness, which can guide individuals towards a more balanced and fulfilling life. In conclusion, for someone who is over-indulgent, a punishment characterized by self-denial is the most suitable method to address and change their behavior, as it fosters self-awareness, self-discipline, and personal growth. Although it requires a significant amount of willpower and introspection, self-denial can lead to many positive transformations and a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. While other forms of punishment may be perceived as too severe or not effective, a self-denying approach encourages personal responsibility, introspection, and mindfulness, allowing for deeper understanding of one's choices and habits, and consequently, leading to lasting change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Vietnamese families plan their activities around their children on this special day. In a Vietnamese folk story, parents were working so hard to prepare for the harvest that they left the children playing by themselves. To make up for that time, the parents would use the Mid-Autumn Festival as a chance to show their love and thanks for their children. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Children's Festival. In the United States, this tradition continues in many Vietnamese-American families. Activities are often centered on children and education. Parents buy lanterns for their children so that they can take part in a candle and lantern parade at dawn. Lanterns mean brightness, while the parade means success in school. Vietnamese markets sell a variety of lanterns, but the most popular children's lantern is the star lantern. Other children's activities include arts and crafts in which children make face masks and lanterns. Children also perform traditional Vietnamese dances for adults and take part in contests for prizes. Unicorn dancers are also very popular. Like Chinese people, Vietnamese parents tell their children folk stories and serve moon cakes and other special treats under the bright moon. A favorite folk story is about a carp that wanted to become a dragon. The carp worked and worked and finally changed itself into a dragon. Parents use this story to encourage their children to work hard so that they can become whatever they want to be. Question: The parents tell their children folk stories because _ .

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Presidential rivals trade charges of lying, Romney calls for apology over 'felony' remark The battle between President Obama and Mitt Romney reached new levels of rancor Thursday, with each campaign accusing the other of lying over Romney's tenure at private-equity firm Bain Capital. The charges flew at a rapid pace, and by the end of the day the Romney campaign was calling for an apology after a senior Obama campaign official said the Republican presidential candidate may have committed a felony. Obama official Stephanie Cutter made the claim following a Boston Globe article that said documents show Romney was in charge at Bain for three years longer than he had claimed. Cutter said Romney was either misrepresenting his position at Bain to the Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"which is a felony,\\" or misrepresenting to the American people. Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades issued a blistering statement in response. \\"President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,\\" Rhoades said. \\"President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.\\" The challenge capped a frenzied and nasty day on the campaign trail. Earlier, Romney released a new ad calling Obama dishonest and asking if the American people can \\"trust him to lead\\" if he \\"doesn't tell the truth.\\" The release which accompanied the ad in an email to reporters also cited Obama's \\"lies and exaggerations.\\" The ad titled, \\"No Evidence,\\" was an aggressive rebuttal to Obama's claims that Romney outsourced jobs while at the helm of Bain Capital. \\"There was no evidence that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas,\\" a narrator says in the ad. But the Obama campaign pushed back in a statement charging the ad is part of Romney's \\"big Bain lie.\\" Relying on the report in the Globe claiming government documents reveal Romney remained CEO of Bain for three years longer than he claimed, the Obama camp statement went on to say the ad is \\"based on a false premise.\\" In a filing with the SEC in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Romney as the company's \\"sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.\\" It said Romney's \\"principal occupation\\" was as Bain's managing director. Romney's campaign repeatedly has said Romney had virtually nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the troubled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Questions about Romney's control at Bain from 1999 to 2001 are important in his bid to oust Obama this fall. That's when the company oversaw investments that either created jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also a time during which Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, said Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Cutter said, Romney hasn't been truthful with the public. \\"If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,\\" she said. But Romney's campaign issued a statement Thursday from Bain that said Romney \\"left Bain Capital in February 1999 to run the Olympics and has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure. Due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999. Accordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period.\\" J.W. Verrett, an attorney and assistant professor in economics, also told Fox News that the original Globe report appeared to \\"be confused\\" about the SEC filings. He noted they refer to \\"Bain Capital VI,\\" which he described as an investment separate from Bain Capital itself. \\"Saying that Governor Romney was the CEO of Bain Capital VI is like saying that I am the CEO of my retirement account ... it's a silly bit of legalese and it doesn't also mean I am CEO of all the companies in which I invest,\\" he said in an email. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"In the 2012 presidential campaign between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, accusations flew between both parties as they disputed Romney's tenure at private-equity firm Bain Capital. The debate escalated after a Boston Globe article claimed Romney was in charge of Bain for three years longer than he stated. As a result, Obama campaign official Stephanie Cutter suggested Romney may have misrepresented his position to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would be a felony. Romney's campaign swiftly responded, calling for an apology and questioning the integrity of Obama's campaign. Alongside this, Romney released an ad titled \\"No Evidence,\\" debunking Obama's claim that Romney outsourced jobs while at Bain. The controversy surrounding Romney's control at Bain between 1999 and 2001 became increasingly important during the campaign due to Bain's management of investment activities during that period."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Your job is to evaluate the truthfulness of these statements. 2. Evaluating the Guidelines: The guidelines provide ten different types of statements you may receive. Each one relates to the ordering of dates/times in different ways - either relating a single date/time to another, or relating a single date/time to a range between two other dates/times.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Police: Abuse of 9-year-old boy escalated from slapping to handcuffing to death HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) – Jack Garcia was a challenging kid — smart, but stubborn and uncommunicative, especially in his early years, according to those who knew him. But by third grade, before his mother moved him across the country to live with a man she'd met online, \\"he was ready to soar,\\" said Margaret Saleh, assistant superintendent of pupil services in the Goleta, California, school system. Once in Maryland, though, the 9-year-old's life changed dramatically — and ended brutally. His mother, Oriana Garcia, didn't enroll him in public schools and considered home-schooling instead. Rather than seeking professional help for Jack's behavioral problems as she'd done in California, police say his mother, Oriana Garcia, allowed her boyfriend, Robert \\"Roy\\" Wilson, and her brother Jacob Barajas to physically discipline the red-haired boy. During the four months they all lived together in Wilson's three-bedroom Hagerstown apartment, the 30-year-old warehouse worker's methods escalated from slapping and sparring to smacking his legs with a bamboo sword, Barajas told police. Then came the handcuffs, with Oriana Garcia's knowledge, \\"to teach Jack not to steal,\\" she told investigators. The abuse culminated June 30 while Garcia worked as a retail store supervisor, according to court records. Barajas handcuffed the boy, and Wilson knocked him down with blows so severe that Jack begged him to stop. Barajas told police it got so bad that he removed the handcuffs, but Wilson continued, repeatedly hitting the boy in the stomach until he passed out. Jack's crime: he was suspected of taking some birthday cake belonging to Wilson's 2-year-old daughter. Police say Garcia planned and participated in some of the discipline, such as making Jack eat until he felt sick and forcing him to exercise. That evening, as Jack lay critically injured, handcuffed and bound to a chair, police say she delayed his care for hours by sending away an ambulance Barajas had called. Only when the boy's breathing turned to alarming gurgles did Wilson make a second 911 call — but it was too late. Jack died five days later. On Wednesday, a judge ordered Garcia and Barajas held without bail on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree child abuse. Their public defender declined comment. Wilson, arrested before Jack's death, is being held is being held on assault and child-abuse charges with bail set at 1 million. He faces the possibility of more charges after a grand jury hearing as early as next week. His public defender has also declined comment, and his brother declined comment when reached by phone Wednesday. Jack's death stunned Daniel Fletcher, a 35-year-old market researcher now living in Orem, Utah, who lived with Garcia for five years in Arizona and California. When they were together, he said, Garcia favored time-outs over corporal punishment because she had read that physical punishment can make a child more aggressive. He said they broke up at her insistence but were still living together in a rented room when she met Wilson online. Garcia had never seen Wilson in person before she pulled Jack out of school and boarded a train in February bound for Hagerstown, a city of 40,000 in the Appalachian foothills about 70 miles west of Baltimore. She was a single mother in a difficult situation, living with a man she no longer loved; otherwise, Fletcher said he doesn't know what motivated her. She transferred to another Ross discount clothing store in the Hagerstown area and brought her brother along to watch Jack while she and Wilson worked. Fletcher, who was working then at a Goleta Kmart, said he would have taken Garcia back, but her mind was made up. She pulled Jack out of school and headed east. He last saw Jack on a Skype conversation a few days before the deadly beating. \\"I cared about her and I cared about Jack,\\" said Fletcher, who traveled to Maryland for the boy's funeral over the weekend. \\"They were my people. They're still my people.\\" Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This is a sad story about a 9-year-old boy named Jack.

Answer the following question: Aubrey came to Lee, distraught as Lee had just lost the game, and hugged them for support. Given the context: How would Lee feel afterwards? Answer:","completion":"Given the context, Lee may likely feel comforted and supported after Aubrey's hug. This is because physical expressions such as hugging are often associated with empathy, care, and support. The justification for this is driven by the information provided in the scenario: 1. Lee had just lost a game, which could indicate that they might be feeling disappointed, frustrated, or sad. 2. Aubrey, recognizing Lee's distress, chooses to hug Lee. This act of consoling, given willingly, signifies Aubrey's intention to provide emotional comfort. 3. Aubrey's action implies that she cares about Lee's feelings, which, in turn, might uplift Lee's spirits to some extent. So, considering these factors and the emotional significance that a consoling hug usually has, one can infer that Lee would probably feel a bit better--more supported and comforted--after the interaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\" Sangria, rather like punch, is a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially in summer.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments.\\" true? + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments\\" can be considered true based on the given premise. The statement clearly states that Sangria, much like punch, serves as a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially during summer. Summer is characterized by hot weather, and refreshers are beverages typically consumed to help people cool down and stay hydrated in high temperature environments. Sangria is originally from Spain, a country known for its hot and sunny Mediterranean climate. The ingredients that make up a classic Sangria include various fruits, red wine (although white wine can also be used), sweeteners such as sugar, a small amount of brandy or another type of alcohol, and some soda water or lemonade to make it fizzy. These ingredients complement each other to create a delicious and refreshing beverage that can help alleviate the effects of heat. The fruit pieces in Sangria not only provide taste but also add to its refreshing nature. Fruits, such as oranges, apples, lemons, and berries, are known for their hydration properties and high water content, making them perfect for hot environments. Additionally, the combination of these fruits with wine, alcohol, and fizz creates a dynamic blend of flavors that is both enjoyable and thirst-quenching. In hot environments, people tend to feel more thirsty and may lose fluids through sweating. A drink like Sangria serves the purpose of replenishing those lost fluids while providing a refreshing and flavorsome experience. It is important to note, however, that Sangria should be consumed in moderation, as it still contains alcohol, which can lead to dehydration if consumed excessively. Moreover, Sangria's popularity as a summer beverage has been well-documented across various cultures and countries that experience hot climates. It is a common sight at summertime gatherings and celebrations, where it is appreciated for its refreshing qualities. In conclusion, based on the premise that Sangria is a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially in summer, it can be said that the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments\\" is true. The combination of fruits, wine, alcohol, and fizz, along with its hydrating properties, make Sangria a perfect choice for a refreshing drink in high-temperature settings. However, it is crucial to consume Sangria responsibly to avoid the potential negative effects of excess alcohol consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The implication here is that Microsoft may have heightened their efforts to monitor and enforce their policies to prevent cheating, hacking, or unauthorized modifications that might impact the overall gaming experience and integrity of their platform, especially since Halo 2 was expected to draw significant attention and online traffic. Microsoft's crackdown aimed to ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming environment for all users and maintain the reputation of both the Xbox game console and the online game service.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

I decided to change the subject and asked him about the scenery and any points of interest along our route. \\"Are there any specific places or landmarks that I should be aware of or possibly stop to check out?\\" He thought for a moment and then began to list off various spots that he thought were worth visiting. \\"There's a breathtaking overlook a few miles up the road.

As my journey progressed, I couldn't shake off the feeling of serenity that enveloped me. The mountain roads, the cascading waterfall, and the sheer beauty that surrounded me served as a reminder of the importance of taking time for oneself and appreciating the wonders of nature. And as I began my descent back to the valley, I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of my initial haste up the mountain.

Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\\" Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. Since the founding of the State of Israel, relatively few women have served in the Israeli government, and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman--Golda Meir--has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government. Although the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,\\" the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates. As of 2016, women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member Knesset, placing it 54th of 185 countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in Scandinavia is over 40%, the European Union average is 17.6%, while in the Arab world it is 6.4%. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties. In January 1986 Israeli female teacher Leah Shakdiel was granted membership in the religious council of Yeruham, but the Minister of Religious Affairs Zvulun Hammer canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council. In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called \\"U'Bizchutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did she return to her position?","completion":"The detailed passage does not explicitly provide information on whether Leah Shakdiel returned to her position.

Movie title: Mirrors 2 Movie plot: Max Matheson (Nick Stahl) was involved in a car accident over a year ago that kills his fiancÃ©e, Kayla (Jennifer Sipes). Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie), making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson (William Katt), reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while apparently \\"cutting himself up\\" on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner), the buyer, Jenna McCarty (Christy Carlson Romano), and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis). Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror, and then sees Jenna's reflection, ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection. Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle then races to his father's house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection, after Max made it to his house and hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do whatever she wants him to do if she spares his father. Max later returns to the Mayflower, but he is stopped by Detectives Huston and Piccirilli (Lance E. Nichols, Wayne PÃ©re), explaining what happened in Ryan and Jenna's deaths. Max denies any involvement and, though they remain suspicious, they let Max get back to his work. Max goes to the main mirror, to find out who the ghost is. Suddenly, Max's reflection shows a light, which Max follows in each of the mirrors. He finds a box and opens it to... Answer:","completion":"Max finds the ID of a young woman named Eleanor Reigns (Stephanie Honoré) in the box. Eleanor was a former employee at the Mayflower Department Store who went missing under mysterious circumstances. Max becomes determined to uncover the truth behind Eleanor's disappearance and the connection to the horrific mirror-related deaths at the store. As Max delves deeper into the mystery, he learns that Eleanor was not just an employee but also had a romantic relationship with Ryan Parker, the store's vice-president of operations. However, their relationship took a dark turn when Eleanor accused Ryan of sexual assault, but for unknown reasons, her claims were never pursued, and Ryan continued to work at the store. As a result, Eleanor tried to warn others about Ryan's actions, leading her to become a target for the store's management. With the help of Dr. Beaumont and some research, Max starts to piece together that the Mayflower Department Store was built on the site of an old sanitarium, which adds to the supernatural elements surrounding the mirrors in the store. It is also revealed that Ryan, Keller, and Jenna were involved in a cover-up surrounding Eleanor's disappearance and alleged death after Ryan murdered her to keep her quiet about his abuse. In the course of the film, the ghost of Eleanor uses the mirrors to exact her vengeance on those responsible for her death, forcing them to confront their reflections that ultimately result in their demise. As Max moves closer to the truth, he becomes vulnerable to Eleanor's wrath. He tries to save his father from a similar fate, by asking the ghost to spare him in exchange for Max helping her bring those responsible to justice. In the end, Max confronts Keller Landreaux and Ryan Parker's accomplices, who ultimately face justice for their crimes. Eleanor's spirit finds solace in knowing her assailants have paid for their actions, and, taking Max's promise into account, she refrains from harming him or his father. The mirrors that haunted Max and the Mayflower Department Store are finally cleansed of Eleanor's vengeful spirit, and order is restored. Investing in the film \\"Mirrors 2\\" depends on various factors, such as the expected target audience, budget, and potential return on investment. The movie's plot incorporates elements of horror, drama, and suspense, making it appealing to fans of these genres. Additionally, the film's exploration of themes such as guilt, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions may resonate with a wider audience. However, potential investors should also consider the film's competition and the current market demand for such movies. Ultimately, investing in the film proposal will rely on a careful evaluation of these factors and thorough market research to estimate potential success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is detained. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits the Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device.

Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: . If you want to be a star, you've got to specialize. What will be the thing that people recognize you for? What's the skill, ability, or talent that will take you to the top? Think about what things come easiest to you, and listen to other people for advice to find your star-making quality. Are you a gifted athlete? When you and your friends get together to play sports, are you always the first picked, or the one to score the most points? If so, you might have the makings of a sports star. Do you love music? Do you enjoy singing, playing an instrument, or dancing to music, you might have the makings of a pop star, a singer, or a rock star. Do you have the gift of gab? Are you a convincing and organizing presence, a leader among your friends? Does everyone listen to what you have to say? If so, you might have the makings of a politician. Do love to pretend? Do you enjoy movies, plays, and television? Do people ever tell you that you have a dramatic presence? If you're a good actor or actress, movie stardom might be in the cards. . Developing your talents into a star-level degree of skill will require help. Whether you want to go pro in acting or sports, politics or music, you've got to get insider info and learn to hone your skills from an expert in the field. Start taking acting or music lessons. Get private coaching for the sport you play. Secure an internship with a local politician, or volunteer for the campaign. Learn everything you can from people who know more than you. Find role-models as well in your field. If you want to be an actor, which actors do you look up to? Who would you like to emulate? Find someone to model your career after. Whether you do it under the guidance of a coach or go it alone, honing your craft is going to take lots and lots of work. For stars, studying the craft should be a 24/7 occupation. Even if you're flipping burgers, you should be rehearsing your lines. Even if you're just taking the bus to school, you should be going over your practice routines. Absorb all the media that you can. Watch classic movies or listen to the type of music you hope to make. Develop a regular practice schedule and devote as much of your free time as possible to improving your talents in your star-making venture. Budding politicians need to practice speeches and public speaking. Musicians need to practice scales. Actors need to rehearse lines and study scenes. Pop stars need to work on their dance moves. Athletes need to train. Be careful to focus on the proper things. For an actor, it can be tempting to get caught up in superficial things. Updating your social networking, checking TMZ, and other gossip rags isn't \\"practicing\\" for being a star. It's wasting time. Study your craft, not the other stuff.
