A high school student allegedly spiked the cafeteria's spaghetti with hot sauce. (Image credit: Brian Yarvin/Getty Images) A Chicago high school student is facing misdemeanor battery charges after allegedly spiking the school cafeteria's spaghetti marinara with hot sauce. Three cafeteria staff members were hospitalized after inhaling fumes from the fiery sauce, according to Highland Park High School spokeswoman Natalie Kaplan. \\"Several staff and students reported reactions to the sauce, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and skin rashes,\\" said Kaplan. \\"The impacted staff members were taken to hospital but no serious injuries were reported.\\" The World's Hottest Pepper: Brings Pleasure and Pain Relief Police say the male student behind the peppery prank, whose name and age have not been released, somehow sneaked \\"Da Bomb\\" hot sauce into a container of marinara sauce during the first lunch period on May 14. \\"A student then went through the food line and purchased spaghetti with marinara sauce, and after sitting down and taking his first bite, found it intolerably hot and went back to the food line to advise staff,\\" said Highland Park Police Deputy Chief George Pfutzenreuter. \\"Staff pulled the sauce from the line and, in evaluating the sauce, some of the staff members also started feeling effects.\\" Pfutzenreuter said he didn't know which type of Da Bomb hot sauce was used in the prank. According to the brand's website, \\"Final Answer Hot Sauce\\" reaches 1,500,000 Scoville units - a level of heat approaching that of law enforcement-grade pepper spray. The alleged perpetrator will be charged as a juvenile on five counts of misdemeanor battery, according to Pfutzenreuter. And the high school plans to install a security camera in the cafeteria food line to fend off future schemes, according to Kaplan. ||||| Da’ Bomb Hot Sauce This is how bombs work: You’re quietly walking down the street, minding your own business, when you hear a slight whistling sound.

Gabby Douglas is flying high—and solo. America's newest gymnastics icon will be the only American to compete in Monday's uneven-bar final—and she'll likely be one of only two gymnasts to perform without a spotter, or someone to catch her if she falls. Look for her coach, Liang Chow, to stand far to the side as Douglas twirls and soars over the chalk-coated bars. \\"He's just, 'You don't need me anymore—you got this,' \\" Douglas said. \\"He knows I can do it.\\" Get the latest Journal coverage of the 2012 Games right here—every story, video, photo or tweet related to the competition and all news off the field. The confidence will help Douglas as she competes for her third gold medal at London, where the 16-year-old already has led the U.S. women to a team victory and became the first African-American to win the individual all-around title. Douglas said she was starting to fathom the frenzy that awaits her when she returns to the U.S. next week. \\"It definitely sank in when Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne were tweeting at me,\\" she said of the rap stars. \\"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I am a superstar.' \\" She also is dealing with some of fame's downside. Her straightened hair has triggered debates on Twitter and other social-media sites, with some women criticizing the style and others calling it unkempt. But the tiff doesn't seem to bother Douglas. \\"What is wrong with my hair? Are you kidding me? I just made history, and you are focusing on my hair?\\" she said. \\"Nothing is going to change. I am going to wear my hair like this for bar finals. You might as well get used to it.\\" Douglas was the only American to qualify for the uneven-bar finals, after scoring 15.333 to finish sixth on the apparatus in the qualifying round. The favorites in the competition are Britain's Beth Tweddle, who led qualifiers with a 16.133 score, as well as two gymnasts each from China and Russia. Besides Douglas and Tweddle, all of Monday's uneven-bar competitors have used a spotter during the London Games. None of the Americans in Tuesday's team final had such help. Aly Raisman didn't use one in Thursday's all-around final, which her coach, Mihai Brestyan, called a strategy to sharpen her concentration. \\"You don't trust nobody,\\" Brestyan said. \\"You trust just in yourself. Sometimes the spotter makes you have half-half decisions because you start the skill and then whatever happens, you don't pay attention, 100%, to the execution. Then you trust to that person, OK whatever happens to me, I will not fall.\\" Spotters, often a male coach, usually scamper underneath gymnasts as they prepare to do aerial moves. Their goal is to at least break the fall of their pupil if she doesn't catch the bar—if not catch them entirely. The spotters aren't perfect. Former Olympic all-around winner Nastia Liukin fell on her face several weeks ago after her father, who is also her coach, didn't get an arm on her. \\"Sometimes the other countries, their spotters don't even catch them. Even though they fall, he's still standing there,\\" said Kyla Ross, one of Douglas's teammates. Chow, Douglas's coach, said he spotted her for the few months it took her to learn her current routine. \\"But after she mastered everything, why would I want to make her more paranoid?\\" he said. \\"That shows her confidence, that shows my confidence. Plus if I'm standing away, I can see her technique better.\\" He said he would stick to the plan when Douglas performs Monday. \\"I have never seen Gabby fall on any of her release moves for three months,\\" he said. \\"Not even once.\\" Corrections & Amplifications Kyla Ross is a teammate of Gabby Douglas.

What festival is celebrated with bread baked from the first grains of wheat harvested????","completion":"The festival that is celebrated with bread baked from the first grains of wheat harvested is Lammas, also known as Lughnasadh or the Feast of St. Peter in Chains. This festival has its roots in various ancient cultures, and it is typically observed on August 1st in the Northern Hemisphere or February 1st in the Southern Hemisphere. Lammas marks the beginning of the harvest season and is celebrated as a festival of thanksgiving for the first fruits of the earth, particularly the newly harvested wheat. Lammas has its origins in the Celtic festival of Lughnasadh, which commemorated the god Lugh, a Celtic warrior and sun god. Lughnasadh was a major event in the agricultural calendar, as it marked the first harvest of the season. People would participate in various rituals and games during this celebration to honor Lugh and ensure a bountiful yield for the rest of the harvest season. In pre-Christian Europe, Lammas also had pagan roots that coincided with the Celtic festival. The name \\"Lammas\\" comes from the Old English \\"hlaf-maesse,\\" which translates to \\"loaf mass.\\" This early festival marked the first loaf of bread baked from the first harvested grains of wheat. Communities would come together to celebrate the harvest, share food, and participate in customs such as making corn dollies or offering loaves of bread to the gods or spirits of the harvest. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, this festival was adopted and adapted to Christian beliefs. In the Christian tradition, Lammas became the Feast of St. Peter in Chains, which commemorated St. Peter's imprisonment and eventual miraculous release. However, many of the original pagan customs remained, such as baking bread from the first wheat harvested. Christians would often bake loaves of bread and bring them to church to be blessed and later used as sacramental bread. Today, Lammas is still celebrated in various forms around the world. In some regions, it is observed as a Christian feast day, while in others, it is embraced as a pagan festival honoring the earth and its harvest. Customs may include baking and sharing bread, creating grain or harvest-themed decorations, feasting, and engaging in traditional games or dances. The festival serves as a reminder of the importance of the harvest and the connection between people and the earth. In conclusion, Lammas, or Lughnasadh, is an ancient festival celebrating the first wheat harvest with bread baked from the newly harvested grains. With roots in Celtic and pagan traditions, it has evolved over time to also incorporate Christian elements. Today, it continues to be a time of thanksgiving, sharing, and honoring the bountiful gifts of the earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose We are located at a high altitude zone happens, how will it affect \\"MORE oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation (high altitude) has a direct effect on the process of oxygen being brought to the body's cells. At high altitudes, the air pressure is lower, which means the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. Consequently, when you take a breath inward, you inhale fewer oxygen molecules compared to sea level. The process you described remains the same, but the lower levels of oxygen in the air make it more challenging for the body to acquire the necessary amount of oxygen: 1. The human body takes a breath inward, but inhales less oxygen due to the thin air. 2. Air with reduced oxygen content is transported to the lungs. 3. Air reaches the alveoli, where the lower oxygen levels create a pressure difference that affects the rate at which oxygen can enter the blood. 4. The dissolved oxygen in the capillary blood is lower than at lower altitudes. 5. Red blood cells pick up oxygen but may not become fully saturated with the limited amounts available. 6. Red blood cells circulate throughout the body but carry less oxygen due to limited saturation. 7. Oxygen reaches the cells within the tissues in reduced quantities. The body will often try to compensate for this lack of oxygen by increasing breathing rate and heart rate in an attempt to deliver more oxygen to its cells and tissues. However, in the short term, this may not be enough to overcome the reduced oxygen availability, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or headaches. Over time, the body can adapt to high-altitude conditions by producing more red blood cells and blood vessels, as well as improving the efficiency of oxygen utilization within the cells. In summary, the high altitude perturbation indirectly hampers the process of oxygen delivery to the body's cells due to the reduced availability of oxygen in the inhaled air. This causes physiological changes in the body as it attempts to adapt to the lower oxygen levels."},{"prompt":"Question: Process: - A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours - Under the right conditions it can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center - If it develops it&#x27;s classified as a &#x27;tropical cyclone&#x27; or &#x27;tropical depression&#x27; - If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a &#x27;tropical storm&#x27; - If the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up and forms a clearly defined &#x27;eye&#x27; it&#x27;s a hurricane - Question: suppose more oxygen enters the blood stream happens, how will it affect LESS POWERFUL hurricanes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: no effect"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl. As he grinningly tries to persuade her to marry him, arguing that she too is a deviant, the only one who can understand him, and that he loves her, Kelly kills him by striking him in the head with a phone receiver.

The author of the tweet is intentionally using informal and colloquial language to express their disdain towards a specific aspect of sports culture – violence in sports or the aggressive behavior of fans associated with it. There are several indicators in the text that help us understand the sentiment: 1. The usage of \\"amen\\" - This term is often used to show agreement or concurrence, suggesting that the tweeter agrees with the sentiment or opinion expressed by @panasonicyouth. However, it should also be noted that \\"amen\\" could be interpreted sarcastically in some instances. 2. \\"stupid sportsball violence\\" - The word \\"stupid\\" signifies the displeasure and irritation the author is feeling towards the subject matter. By choosing the term \\"sportsball\\" instead of \\"sports,\\" they might be suggesting that they see sports as trivial or unimportant, and that they don't understand why people are getting violent or aggressive about it. 3. The casual language and expressions might indicate that the author is not speaking from personal experience, but is merely annoyed by the behavior of others in association with the sport. This could be a reaction to a specific event they saw in the news, experienced personally, or witnessed on social media. 4. It is essential to point out that the tweet is short and concise, which sometimes suggests that the sentiment expressed might be more straightforward and direct. However, it can also denote sarcasm, depending on the context, which is a bit difficult to decipher without additional information. In conclusion, based on the language, tone, and choice of words, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as negative. The author appears to be expressing their disdain for violent behavior related to sports, and they may be using sarcasm to further emphasize their point. The tweet likely reflects the author's personal opinion on the matter, and they might be trying to convey this feeling to their followers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He achieved stardom for his acting achievements. In particular, he is best known for his motion picture portrayal of the classic DC comic book superhero Superman, beginning with the acclaimed Superman (1978), for which he won a BAFTA Award. Reeve appeared in other critically acclaimed films such as The Bostonians (1984), Street Smart (1987) and The Remains of the Day (1993). Christopher Reeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City, the son of Barbara Pitney (Lamb) (1929-2000), a journalist, and Franklin D'Olier Reeve (1928-2013), a teacher, novelist, poet, and scholar. Reeve was of almost entirely English ancestry, with many family lines that had been in America since the early 1600s. His paternal grandfather, Colonel Richard Henry Reeve, had been the CEO of Prudential Financial (when it was called Prudential Life Insurance Company) for over 25 years. Reeve's father was a Princeton University graduate studying for a master's degree in Russian at Columbia University prior to the birth of his son, Christopher. Despite being born wealthy, Franklin Reeve spent summers working at the docks with longshoremen. Reeve's mother had been a student at Vassar College but transferred to Barnard College to be closer to Franklin, whom she had met through a family connection. They had another son, Benjamin, born on October 6, 1953. Franklin and Barbara divorced in 1956, and she moved with her two sons to Princeton, New Jersey, where they attended Nassau Street School. Later that year, Franklin Reeve married Helen Schmidinger, a Columbia University graduate student. Barbara Pitney Lamb married Tristam B. Johnson, a stockbroker, in 1959. Johnson enrolled Christopher and his brother, Benjamin, in Princeton Country Day School, which later merged with Miss Fine's School for Girls to become the co-educational Princeton Day School. Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; he was on the honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. The sportsmanship award at Princeton Day School's invitational hockey tournament was named in Reeve's honor. Reeve admitted that he put pressure on himself to act older than he actually was in order to gain his father's approval. Reeve found his passion in 1962 at age nine when he was cast in an amateur version of the operetta The Yeomen of the Guard; it was the first of many student plays. In mid-1968, at age fifteen, Reeve was accepted as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The other apprentices were mostly college students, but Reeve's older appearance and maturity helped him fit in with the others. In a workshop, he played a scene from A View from the Bridge that was chosen to be presented in front of an audience. After the performance, actress Olympia Dukakis said to him, \\"I'm surprised. You've got a lot of talent. Don't mess it up.\\" The next summer, Reeve was hired at the Harvard Summer Repertory Theater Company in Cambridge for 44 per week. He played a Russian sailor in The Hostage and Belyayev in A Month in the Country. Famed theater critic Elliot Norton called his performance as Belyayev \\"startlingly effective.\\" The 23-year-old lead actress in the play, a Carnegie Mellon graduate, turned out to be Reeve's first romance. She was engaged to a fellow Carnegie Mellon graduate at the time; they mutually ended the relationship when he made a surprise visit to her dorm room at seven in the morning and found Reeve with her. Reeve's romance with the actress fizzled a few months later when the age difference became an issue. Reeve was briefly involved with Scientology but opted out of becoming a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.","completion":"This text is about Christopher D'Olier Reeve, an American actor who is best known for his role as Superman in the DC comic book movies.

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Based on the premise \\"Station Here Jesus receives the crose is taken away, beaten, and mocked by a crowd in the fortress courtyard.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Jesus was never stationed here at all.\\" is true (see options)? Possible answers: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","completion":"(c). no. Given the premise, the hypothesis \\"Jesus was never stationed here at all\\" is contradicted because it provides clearly that Jesus was in fact 'stationed' at a place, which is referred to as the \\"Fortress Courtyard\\". The content of the premise describes the course of events occurring in this location, namely, \\"Jesus receives the cross, is taken away, beaten, and mocked by a crowd.\\" These events establish the presence of Jesus in this location at some point in time. It is important, however, to take note of the term 'stationed'. Ideally, it is used to denote the assignment of a specific place or duty to someone. In this context, the premise does not necessarily indicate that Jesus was officially stationed, or assigned, to the courtyard as if it was his duty post. The term 'stationed' only serves to locate him in the Fortress Courtyard as the place where the described events transpired. This makes the hypothesis – \\"Jesus was never stationed here at all\\" – incorrect based on the premise provided, as the events occurred while Jesus was at that location. So when you are evaluating this statement within this context, you should keep in mind that phrases and words can have different meanings and implications depending on how they are used and this can directly affect the interpretations of statements or hypotheses based on them. Overall, the interpretation of these statements requires not just a literal reading of the words, but an understanding of the implied and contextual meanings. In this case, whether or not Jesus was officially 'stationed' in the fortress courtyard, it is clearly implied that he was indeed present in that location for the mentioned events to take place. And therefore, our conclusion is option (c) no, the hypothesis \\"Jesus was never stationed here at all\\" cannot be considered true based on the premise provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: who is the heroine of quit india movement?","completion":"Your question focuses on the heroine of the Quit India Movement, a significant phase in India's struggle for independence. While many women bravely fought for India's freedom and made crucial contributions, Aruna Asaf Ali is widely recognized as the 'Heroine of the 1942 Movement'. Aruna Asaf Ali, born Aruna Ganguly on July 16, 1909, played an instrumental role in the Quit India Movement launched by the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1942. She is most famous for hoisting the Indian National Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay during the Quit India Movement's launch, following the arrest of many senior leaders. This act made her an icon for all women and men fighting for India's freedom. When most Congress leaders were imprisoned, Aruna chose to stay outside prison and helped fan the sparks of the movement. She went underground to evade arrest, during which she edited 'Inquilab', a monthly magazine, to keep the spirit of freedom alive among masses. Her courageous actions inspired countless people to join the movement and resist British rule. For this reason, the British government announced a hefty reward for her capture. Possessing an indomitable spirit, Aruna worked relentlessly to motivate people to participate in the freedom struggle. Her role was not confined to the Quit India Movement alone. Even after India's independence, she remained politically active and continued to work for the upliftment of the poor and marginalized sections of society. In recognition of her invaluable contribution to the nation, she was awarded India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1997. Besides, she was also honored with the International Lenin Peace Prize in 1964. Therefore, Aruna Asaf Ali, with her extraordinary courage and relentless work towards India's independence, is fondly remembered as the heroine of the Quit India Movement.

He will also sit down with folks who have lost family members to anti-gay violence. \\"I know how bad bullying can hurt,\\" Morgan tells me exclusively. \\"I was bullied when I was a kid.

The '30 Rock' star got himself into some deep trouble with comments he made last week about gay people during a stand-up routine. As Tracy's first big break was a spot on Russell Simmons Presents Def Comedy Jam, it is no surprise that the \\"godfather of hip-hop\\" reached out to the funnyman to check in with his long-time friend. With both of their permission, we give you the full transcript of their conversation. Russell Simmons: I've known you since the beginning of your career and have always thought you were one of the funniest guys in the game. Ever since I saw you on Def Comedy Jam, I knew you were going to be extraordinarily successful. But, I gotta be honest, I was quite disappointed when I read about your comments you made about having a gay son and about gay people in general. Tracy Morgan: I guess the reason I am successful is because I am so unfiltered. And sometimes as a result I say really stupid shit. The truth is if I had a gay son, I would love him just as much as if he was straight ... I might have to try to love even more because I know of the difficulty that he would have in society. Russell: Having fought for decades for the gay community in their struggle to be treated fairly and with dignity, I think you know you crossed the line. However, I know you...I know you very well. And I know that deep down inside there is no hate in your heart. Tracy: Of all the sicknesses, there is probably none more abusive than homophobia. My heart is committed to giving everyone the same rights that I deserve for myself. I don't care if you love the same sex as long as you have the ability to love someone. Also, you should have the right no matter who you are to protect and serve our country. I am deeply sorry for the comments I made.

Plot title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.

Answer:","completion":"The company that sponsored the 1995-1996 Premier League season was Carling, a popular British beer brand. Carling's sponsorship of the Premier League lasted from 1993 to 2001 and bestowed the full title \\"FA Carling Premiership\\" upon the league during this duration. Carling is a brand of lager produced by the brewing company Molson Coors Beverage Company, which has an extensive history that can be traced back to multiple locations and companies. Molson Coors Beverage Company, as it is known today, was formed by the merger of Canadian company Molson and American company Coors in 2005. To determine the beginnings of Carling sponsorship, we need to examine the history of both Molson and Coors. The Molson part of the company finds its roots in Montreal, Canada, where it was founded in 1786 by John Molson. It is one of the oldest brewing companies in North America and holds a strong market presence in Canada. Coors, on the other hand, was founded in 1873 by Adolph Coors in Golden, Colorado, United States. Coors was a well-established brand in the American beer market before joining forces with Molson. However, the Carling brand itself originated in London, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1840 by Thomas Carling as the Worts and Carling brewery. Later in 1952, the brand was bought by Canadian Breweries Limited (CBL), which subsequently became Carling O'Keefe in 1973. Eventually, in 1989, Carling O'Keefe merged with Molson, paving the way for Carling to become a part of the Molson Coors Beverage Company. Therefore, to answer the question, the company that sponsored the 1995-1996 Premier League, Carling, finds its origins in London, Ontario, Canada, where it was founded in 1840. However, it should be noted that the contemporary company responsible for the brand, Molson Coors Beverage Company, has a diverse history that combines the heritages of Molson (founded in Montreal, Canada) and Coors (founded in Golden, Colorado, United States)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you think highly of human's life, this article is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing.

Premise: \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" true?","completion":"When analyzing the given premise, \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\", and comparing it with the hypothesis, \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\", it is essential to consider the definitions and implications of the terms \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared.\\" Although the two words are often used interchangeably, on closer inspection, we can observe subtle differences that may affect the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise. First, let's examine the meaning of the word \\"ready.\\" In this context, \\"ready\\" refers to the state of being willing and able to take action or proceed with a task. It implies that the speaker is equipped or mentally prepared to engage in a given action, which, in this case, is the process of redeeming the mentioned individual. The word \\"prepared,\\" on the other hand, corresponds to the state of having made arrangements or plans to do something ahead of time. It typically involves acquiring the necessary knowledge, resources, and tools to execute a particular task successfully. Therefore, \\"prepared\\" suggests that the speaker has not only the willingness but also the means to accomplish the stated objective. Despite their subtle differences, \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared\\" share similar connotations because they both denote certain degrees of mental, emotional, or physical readiness to undertake a given task. Consequently, a person described as being \\"ready\\" for a specific action may also be perceived as \\"prepared\\" to carry it out, and vice versa, depending on the context. In light of this, we can now address the original question: Based on the premise \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\", is the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" true? When we consider that both \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared\\" suggest a certain level of willingness and capability for a task, it is reasonable to assume that being in the state of readiness involves some degree of preparation. Even though the premise explicitly states that the speaker is \\"ready\\" to redeem the individual, the underlying implication that the speaker possesses the necessary resources or mental fortitude can still be inferred. Under this assumption, the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" can be considered accurate to a certain extent. While the specific details of the preparations may not be explicitly mentioned in either the premise or the hypothesis, the willingness and capability needed to pursue the act of redemption remain consistent across both statements. Therefore, from a semantic perspective, we can conclude that the hypothesis is likely true, based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Fact 1: If an object in a fluid is more dense than that fluid then that object will sink in that fluid because of gravity. Fact 2: Water is usually the best fluid. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\" with the following options: - water - gravity - calcite - wood - liquid - rain - outer space - crust Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\", let's go through the options: 1. Water: Fact 2 states that water is usually the best fluid. Fact 1 indicates that an object more dense than a fluid will sink in that fluid. Since water is a fluid, if the object's density is more than water, it will sink in it. So, this is a possible answer. 2. Gravity: Gravity is a force, not a fluid. Therefore, objects do not sink in gravity. Discard this option. 3. Calcite: Calcite is a mineral, not a fluid. Discard this option. 4. Wood: Wood is a solid material, not a fluid. Discard this option. 5. Liquid: Liquid is a general term for fluids, but it does not specify the particular fluid. Since Fact 2 suggests that water is the best fluid, it's better to choose water as the fluid where the denser object will sink. Keep this option but prioritize water. 6. Rain: Rain is a form of water, but in individual droplets, not a continuous fluid body. Discard this option. 7. Outer space: Outer space is a vacuum, but it does have microgravity. Objects do not sink in outer space as they would in a fluid due to the lack of gravity. Discard this option. 8. Crust: Crust is a solid, not a fluid. Discard this option. Considering the analysis of all options, the answer should be water, as it matches with both Fact 1 and Fact 2. Thus, an object will sink in water if it's more dense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Upcycle your aluminum cans into planters. How would you accomplish this goal? Available options: i. Cut the top and bottom off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down on both sides and fill with dirt. Add plant.. ii. Cut the top off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down and fill with dirt. Add plant..","completion":"To accomplish the goal of upcycling aluminum cans into planters, you may choose from the two available options mentioned. Both methods are great for repurposing aluminum cans and giving them a new life as functional planters. The primary difference between the two options is whether you cut off only the top or both the top and bottom. Here, I will provide a detailed comparison between the two methods and a step-by-step guide on how to proceed with each option. Option i: Cut the top and bottom off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down on both sides and fill with dirt. Add plant. Pros: 1. Better drainage: As the bottom of the can is removed, this method provides better drainage for the plants compared to Option ii. It helps prevent waterlogging and root rot in the planter. 2. More decorative options: You can decorate the can by painting the exterior, or you can intertwine multiple cans to create unique planters. Cons: 1. Requires a stable base: You need to place the can on a stable and flat base, like a tray or saucer since it does not have a bottom. This adds an extra step to ensure the planter is appropriately set up. Step-by-step guide: 1. Gather your materials: an aluminum can, a can opener, a pair of gloves, a pair of pliers, scissors, a file or sandpaper, a clean cloth, dirt or potting mix, your chosen plant, and a tray or dish to act as the planter's base. 2. Use the can opener to carefully remove the top and bottom of the aluminum can. Wear gloves to protect your hands. 3. Use the pliers and scissors to fold the aluminum lip down on both sides, creating a relatively smooth edge. Make sure there are no sharp edges. 4. Rinse the can well with water and dry it using a clean cloth. 5. File or sand the edges of the can to eliminate any remaining sharp points. 6. Place the can on a flat and stable base, such as a tray or saucer. 7. Fill the can with dirt or potting mix. 8. Dig a hole in the dirt to plant your seed or transplant your chosen plant. Option ii: Cut the top off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down and fill with dirt. Add plant. Pros: 1. Easier setup: Since the bottom of the can is intact, you can place the planter on any surface without requiring an extra tray or dish. 2. Good for shallow-rooted plants: This method is ideal for plants with shallow root systems that do not require extremely well-draining soil. Cons: 1. Limited drainage: Depending on the can, drainage might be limited which can lead to issues such as waterlogging. Step-by-step guide: 1. Gather your materials: an aluminum can, a can opener, a pair of gloves, a pair of pliers, scissors, a file or sandpaper, a clean cloth, dirt or potting mix, and your chosen plant. 2. Use the can opener to carefully remove the top of the aluminum can. Wear gloves to protect your hands. 3. Use the pliers and scissors to fold the aluminum lip down, creating a relatively smooth edge. Make sure there are no sharp edges. 4. Rinse the can well with water and dry it using a clean cloth. 5. File or sand the edges of the can to eliminate any remaining sharp points. 6. Optionally, drill a few small drainage holes in the bottom of the can to allow excess water to escape. 7. Fill the can with dirt or potting mix. 8. Dig a hole in the dirt to plant your seed or transplant your chosen plant. Both options offer unique benefits and are suited for different plants and setups. To choose the best option for you, consider the specific requirements of the plants you want to grow and the preferred aesthetic of your space, whether indoors or outdoors. With either choice, you are giving new life to aluminum cans and promoting sustainability, all while creating beautiful planters to brighten up your environment."},{"prompt":"USS Hingham (PF-30) a Tacoma-class frigate was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Hingham Massachusetts.

When Johnny Quinlan loses his job in a drug store, he is afraid to tell his wife, Bertha, and therefore keeps up the pretense of leaving each morning for a non-existent job, as he begins the search for a new job. As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have. As he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \\"Nifty\\" Herman, a small-time gangster. Nifty had loaned Johnny 15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him. After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store. All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days. Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment. However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't. Taking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home. When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting. Newton is a government agent. Even though Johnny tries to hide the case, his efforts are futile, and Newton spies it and becomes suspicious, seeing a resemblance to a case he and his men have been attempting to track down.

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor dynasty and House of Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.

OPT: [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"A black dog sits by two bowls near some tile steps.\\" does mean that \\"Near the steps are a dog and some bowls.\\" When breaking down the statement, we can see the following elements: 1. A black dog: The subject being described is a dog that is black. 2. Sits: The dog's position is sitting. 3. By two bowls: The dog is located near two bowls, which associates the dog and the bowls spatially. 4. Near some tile steps: This part of the statement describes the dog's position and, subsequently, the bowls' position as being close to some tile steps. By dissecting the phrase, it is clear that the dog and the two bowls are in proximity to the tile steps. Therefore, the statement \\"Near the steps are a dog and some bowls.\\" is an accurate depiction of the original sentence. It might also be important to note that while the second statement is true, it does not mention the dog's color, which was specified as black in the original statement.

Steve Way celebrated with his first pint of lager for three months after breaking a 35-year-old British record to finish 10th in the Commonwealth Games marathon. The bank worker from Bournemouth weighed 16-and-a-half stone seven years ago, but has given up his ‘couch potato lifestyle’ — smoking 20 days cigarettes a day, boozing and eating junk food — to shed nearly half his body weight and take his place among the elite. The 40-year-old’s time of 2hr 15min 16sec yesterday smashed Ron Hill’s 1979 best for over-40s. Way was the second British man home after Scotland’s Derek Hawkins, who finished ninth. Personal best: Steve Way completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon. Post-race recovery: Way used to weigh more than 16st and smoke 20 cigarettes a day before changing his lifestyle to become a marathon runner. Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever' Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. ‘I need to go have a drink and I’m not talking about water,’ said Way. ‘I’m going to have a pint or few as I haven’t had one for three months. ‘I can’t go completely off the rails because I’ve got a 90-kilometre (55-mile) race in Sweden at the end of August. ‘I’m absolutely delighted. This is the best day ever. Running is normally second place to my wedding day but this one matches it. ‘My wife Sarah won’t mind because my goals were top 10, personal best, British record and I’ve managed all three so I’ve couldn’t have hoped for a better day. ‘I hope I’m an inspiration. There are quite a few people out there that say they are getting themselves off the couch, getting out the door and seeing whether there is a marathon runner hidden underneath that couch potato.’ Way’s England team-mates Nicholas Torry, 37, and Ben Moreau, 32, finished 13th and 14th respectively. Australia’s Michael Shelley, who never bothers to look at a marathon course before he runs it, won gold with a time of 2hr 11min 15sec. Shelley, 30, won silver in Delhi four years ago in only his second outing over 26.2miles and on Sunday became the second man after Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission in Glasgow, to reach the podium in consecutive Commonwealth Games. Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running. Shelley took up running because his parents did not want him to play contact sports after he was born with a hole in his diaphragm. The Australian said: ‘To come back and win now I’ve got a bit more experience is indescribable. It was a dream. I can’t believe it.’ Stephen Chemlany finished 43secs behind Shelley. He won Kenya’s first medal of these Games, but there were two more shortly afterwards in the women’s marathon as Flomena Cheyech Daniel, 32, took gold and Caroline Kilel, 33, won silver. Scotland’s Susan Partridge was the first British runner home in sixth place, with England’s Louise Damen seventh and Amy Whitehead ninth. The third English runner, Alyson Dixon, retired with a calf injury.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February.

Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Ravens the Dolphins played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Titans. In the first quarter the Dolphins took the lead as RB Ronnie Brown got a 2-yard TD run. The Titans replied with RB Chris Johnson getting a 17-yard TD run. They fell behind after kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 40-yard field goal. They eventually took the lead after kicker Dan Carpenter made a 23 and a 26-yard field goal, which was soon followed by QB Chad Henne completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB Patrick Cobbs. The Titans replied with QB Vince Young completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington, but the Dolphins continued to score after Carpenter got a 42-yard field goal, followed by QB Tyler Thigpen making a 9-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano (With a failed 2-point conversion). Then FS Reshad Jones intercepted a pass in the end zone for a touchback. Answer this question: How many more field goals did Carpenter make than Bironas?","completion":"First, we need to identify the number of field goals each kicker made in the summary. Dan Carpenter made a 23-yard, a 26-yard, and a 42-yard field goal. That's a total of 3 field goals. Rob Bironas made a 40-yard field goal. That's a total of 1 field goal.

A:","completion":"Part #1: Assess the quality of an argument Usage: In the sample provided: \\"The death penalty is deterrence for the rest of society, both criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens\\", we need to assess whether the statement makes a clear, understandable point. This statement meets the criteria as it implies that the existence of the death penalty can serve as a preventative measure that discourages individuals (criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens) from engaging in criminal behavior that would warrant such a sentence. This statement is clearly understandable and makes a point regarding a potential benefit of the death penalty. Part #2: Determine if the argument is valid Usage: The argument validity is evaluated, in this case \\"The death penalty is deterrence for the rest of society, both criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens\\" is a valid argument because it is clearly interpretable, expresses an argument, and is specifically related to the topic of death penalty. Part #3: Check if the argument is on the topic of death penalty Usage: The sample argument is on the topic of death penalty since it discusses possible effects of death penalty on different sections of society.

For Democrats, the midterms are all about holding their slim Senate majority and, if possible, defying historical odds by retaking the House of Representatives.

Citing new intelligence, [Deputy PM's Name] emphasized the urgency of addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions, which have long been a point of contention within the international community. According to the Deputy PM, Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear capabilities pose a serious danger to Israel and its allies, prompting heightened concern amongst Israeli officials. The restoration of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has not doused the fears, as [Deputy PM's Name] believes it may not be sufficient to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. Given Iran's past approach to nuclear development and frequent references to Israel as its enemy, Israeli officials are taking this threat seriously. The Deputy PM's warning came after a series of high-profile meetings, where the issue was discussed in depth with regional and global leaders, including US representatives. The Israeli government urges the international community to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with this potential threat. [Deputy PM's Name] suggested adopting tougher sanctions on Iran, alongside vigilance in monitoring the country's nuclear activities. He further emphasized the need for cooperation among the world powers, including the United States, European Union and the Middle East countries, in working collectively towards ensuring the safety and security of the region. In conclusion, the Israeli Deputy PM's warning of an imminent Iranian nuclear threat highlights the precarious state of affairs in the Middle East. As Iran continues to advance its nuclear capabilities, it is crucial for the international community to join forces in addressing this burgeoning crisis. By working together, countries can adopt focused strategies aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions and ensuring long-term stability and peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: After the cancellation was announced, how did the people of North Korea feel about it? Answer: A:","completion":"It is difficult to accurately determine the feelings of the people of North Korea after the cancellation of the joint military exercises, as the country is known for its strict control over information dissemination and public opinion. However, it can be assumed that North Koreans likely viewed the cancellation positively, as their government has long called for the end of these joint military exercises, claiming that they are offensive \\"rehearsals for war.\\" The North Korean government might have framed the cancellation as a sign of progress towards reducing tensions and building trust with the United States and South Korea. Furthermore, the decision to cancel the exercises could also have been seen as a step towards denuclearization and fostering diplomatic relations, demonstrating that the negotiations between the three countries have the potential to yield positive outcomes. Nonetheless, it is vital to keep in mind that the exact sentiment of the North Korean people cannot be definitively determined due to the nation's secretive nature and restrictions on the flow of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.

This can create a ripple effect, generating positivity and motivation among their social circles. 6. Environmentally Conscious Choices: Motivated by the newly discovered enthusiasm for painting, some may research and opt for eco-friendly painting materials and practices.

Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

Based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", let's analyze the statements step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the elements of the premise. In the premise, there are two main elements: 1. \\"Good-bye\\" - This indicates a farewell or a situation in which someone is leaving. 2. \\"Good luck\\" - This indicates a wish for success or positive outcomes for the person who is leaving. Step 2: Compare the elements of the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" This implies that leaving is prohibited and may result in a negative consequence, which is a curse. Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Upon analysis, the premise does not support the hypothesis. The premise suggests a positive or at least neutral attitude towards the person leaving, as shown by wishing them good luck. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a negative consequence for leaving, which contradicts the sentiment expressed in the premise. Conclusion: Based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" is true. The premise does not provide any evidence that supports the hypothesis, and in fact, it contradicts the suggested negative outcome of leaving."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Let's hear it for \\"the man of the moment, the man of the millennium.\\" That man is Narendra Modi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Prime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. \\"Modi, Modi, Modi,\\" chanted the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Modi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the Allphones Arena. \\"You're a rock star!\\" shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that #Rockstar and #ModiInAustralia began trending on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Modi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia -- almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. \\"Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. ... India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,\\" Modi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Modi really the man of the millennium? The hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Rightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, about a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, leaner and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk. In Hindi, in Gujarati, in English, Modi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, riffing on his key anthems at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platinum sales Indians now seem to expect? We're beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist Anand Mahindra told CNN that Modi's \\"honeymoon period is over.\\" When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying \\"people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate\\" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Modi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Mumbai last month, Modi made a speech, played out live on many Indian TV channels. Curiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Ganesha -- who is depicted as having an elephant's head -- Modi claimed that Ganesha's half-man, half-elephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? The Indian TV anchor and journalist Karan Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. \\"He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Make in India' state-of-the-art (defense) weaponry,\\" Thapar wrote. \\"These are 21st-century ambitions. How does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology?\\" He added, \\"The silence of the media is deeply disturbing. It feels as though it's been deliberately blanked out by everyone.\\" I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy only to portray Modi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rock-star levels of adulation. Modi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Modi's seven months as Prime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still subpar; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. So do Modi's fans. Highlights:","completion":"- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad due to his speeches on faster growth, job creation, improved infrastructure, and transparent government. - However, some critics argue that Modi's focus on ancient mythology detracts from his 21st-century ambitions and question whether his proposed reforms can be sustained. - Despite the excitement, Modi's first seven months as Prime Minister haven't seen significant change yet, with hundreds of millions of Indians still struggling with poverty, subpar infrastructure, and lack of social safety nets. - While Modi's impact on India is undeniable, caution is necessary in terms of expectations for progress and change, which could take decades to materialize in a country as massive and diverse as India."},{"prompt":"Information: - Ira Gershwin (December 6, 1896 August 17, 1983) was an American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, composer George Gershwin, to create some of the most memorable songs of the 20th century. - Guy Reginald Bolton (23 November 1884 4 September 1979) was an Anglo-American playwright and writer of musical comedies.

For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B.

First question: Which is faster: rsync or scp? Second question: What is rsync speedup? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPTIONS: * no; * yes;","completion":"First question: I will compare the two utilities to determine which is faster. rsync and scp are both utilities used for copying files between remote systems. rsync is typically faster than scp because it uses delta-transfer algorithm which only transfers the differences between the source and destination files, rather than transferring entire files. Additionally, rsync can compress the data during transfer, further reducing transfer times. Second question: I will define rsync speedup and provide examples. Rsync speedup is a measure of how much faster rsync is when compared to other file transfer methods, particularly when updating existing files. Speedup is calculated by comparing the total size of the files being updated to the amount of data actually transferred during the update. A significant speedup occurs when the majority of the files remain unchanged and only a small portion of the files need to be updated. For example, if you have 100 MB of files, but only 5 MB of them have been updated, rsync will only transfer the changed 5 MB. In this scenario, the rsync speedup would be 20x (100 MB / 5 MB) compared to transferring the entire files. No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is comparing the speed of rsync and scp, while the second question is defining the concept of rsync speedup.

Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption - Question: suppose there is more oxygen produced happens, how will it affect MORE or GREATER eruptions. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"The presence or increase in oxygen levels wouldn't directly lead to more, less, or no effect on volcanic eruptions. Volcanic eruptions primarily depend on the geological activities and conditions within the Earth’s crust, such as the subduction of tectonic plates, the temperature, and pressure in the mantle, and the type of magma involved. The composition of the magma (including its gas content, viscosity, and temperature) primarily determines the type and intensity of the volcanic eruption. In the context of volcanic processes, oxygen could play a role in the oxidation state of the magma. This refers to the amount of oxygen available for chemical reactions, which can influence the composition of the magma. However, oxygen being produced in greater quantities on the surface of the Earth does not strongly imply a change in the oxygen levels deep in the Earth’s crust or mantle, where magma forms. Certain gases such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are more directly influencing the explosivity of the eruptions. They can increase the pressure within a volcano when they are dissolved in magma, and a sudden release of these pressurized gases can cause a violent eruption. In essence, an increase in the production of oxygen wouldn't necessarily result in more or greater eruptions unless it substantially altered the oxidative state of the magma, which is unlikely given the involved depths and temperatures. Therefore, more oxygen production typically should have minimal to no immediate effect on the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions. Hence, the closest answer to this would be (C: no effect), but it's crucial to remember that the actual impact would also depend on many other factors like temperature, pressure, and the existing geological conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: how many innings in overtime in baseball I found the following answer on Google: According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the information you found in the Oxford English Dictionary does not answer your question regarding how many innings in overtime in baseball. They seem to be discussing the term's origin in relation to cricket rather than baseball. In baseball, there is no designated number of innings for overtime. Instead, the game continues into extra innings until one team is ahead at the end of a completed inning. After the completion of the standard nine innings, if the two teams are tied, they will proceed to play additional innings as required. During these extra innings, each team is given the opportunity to bat and score runs, just as they would during the first nine innings. The extra innings are played until a winner is determined - a team outscoring the other at the end of a completed extra inning. In some cases, this could take only one extra inning, while in others, it may take several more innings for a team to outscore the other and ultimately win the game. It should be noted that in Major League Baseball (MLB) regular-season games, a new rule was implemented in 2020 to speed up the game during extra innings. This rule places a runner on second base to start each extra inning, increasing the chances for faster run scoring and reducing the duration of overtime games. In summary, there is no fixed number of innings in overtime (extra innings) in baseball.

Title: Raging Bull Movie plot: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Dan found three rattle snakes: one only had one rattle, the second snake had 4 rattles and the third snake had seven rattles on its tail. and a hint : At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.[13] The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.[14] A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.[15] Please answer this question : Which snake had more segments, the first or the second snake Dan found? Answer:","completion":"The second snake that Dan found had more segments. According to the hint provided, a rattlesnake is born with a small button or 'primordial rattle' on its tail. The first segment is added when the snake sheds its skin for the first time, and each subsequent shedding of the skin adds a new segment to the rattle. Taking this information into account, let's analyze the situation of the two snakes: 1. The first snake had only one rattle. This indicates that it has only the primordial rattle plus one additional segment added after its first shedding of skin. Therefore, the first snake has a total of 2 segments (1 primordial rattle + 1 from the first shedding). 2. The second snake had four rattles. This suggests that it has gone through more shedding cycles, with the primordial rattle and three additional segments added after each shedding of its skin. So, the second snake has a total of 5 segments (1 primordial rattle + 3 from subsequent sheddings). Comparing the two, it's clear that the second snake has more segments (5) than the first snake (2)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zhang Heng (Chinese: Zhang Heng ; AD 78-139), formerly romanized as Chang Heng, was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. Zhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century clock tower. The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official Chen Hongmou (1696-1771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book Spiritual Constitution of the Universe. The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and James A. Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to seismology. The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to \\"make three wheels rotate as if they were one.\\" More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath. However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories. Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83-161) of Roman Egypt, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state: Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step. Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.","completion":"This text is about Zhang Heng, a Han Chinese polymath who lived during the Han dynasty.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: Yesterday I attended the world premiere of \\"Descent\\" at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a great time. It was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my-spacer Marcus Patrick. I give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars. The movie begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college. You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become sweethearts. It appears like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played this well. Very innocent flirtation between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. The apartment is very dreary and dark. They eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for the young or weak at heart. The rape scene is a little long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows. Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. She is told to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say \\"he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving\\". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience. Maya is then back in college as a TA and who is in her class -- Jared her rapist!! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next?? The shots of her face and the emotions are priceless. What unfolds next is not actually whats happening. She acts interested in Jared. She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. I was sitting there saying could this really be happening. It wasn't. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She invites him to her apartment and of course, he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She has him strip down completely. He thinks he's going to get \\"lucky\\". She then teases him like any woman can. She's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. Note:: for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer. She then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, gritty, and very rough. If you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph. This is where Adrian reenters the picture. Maya has Adrian save(?) her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. Marcus, as Adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone can. He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. After the movie, during a Q&A session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her but I don't think it does. One of the final scenes has a closeup of Mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. This was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted?? Was it as satisfying as she expected?? In my opinion, it does not. It only makes matters worse. This is an excellent movie, will well acted roles, and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done. The directing and photography must also be commended.

Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt. Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. Francis Bok waited three years, until 1996, before he tried to escape again. During the intervening three years he tended to the herds and regained Giemma's trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok's work with the animals yet still forced him to live a life of slavery. Bok finally escaped from Giemma when he was 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police department to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as he walked into the crowded marketplace. Bok asked a man with a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to transport Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein in the back of his truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The State Council submitted a bill which aims to allow couples to have two children if either parent is an only child. It focuses on adjusting and improving the family planning policy. The State Council argues adjustment to the policy in the face of a steadily declining birth rate. The birth rate has remained relatively low and shows a tendency to fall further. The rate has dropped to between 1.5 and 1.6 since the 1990s, which means each Chinese woman of child-bearing age gives birth to 1.5 to 1.6 children on average. The working population began to drop in 2012 by 3.45 million every year, and it is likely to fall by 8 million each year after 2023. The population aged 60 and above will reach 400 million and account for one-fourth of the total population in the early 2030s, up from one-seventh now. \\"If the current family planning policy continues, the birth rate will continue to fall and lead to a sharp drop of the total population after reaching a peak,\\" said Li Bin, minister in charge of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. \\"It is the right time to make changes: The low birth rate is stable, the working population is still large and the burden of supporting the elderly remains relatively light,\\" he added. An increase in birth is expected if the policy changes but will not seriously affect the food supply, public education, health care or employment. China's food safety and public service plans are designed to meet the needs of 1.43 billion population in 2020 and 1.5 billion in 2033. Even with the policy change, the total population will reach no more than 1.38 billion in 2015, Li said. Question: What can we learn about the population in China from the passage? Options: A: After the year of 2023, the population will become less and less. B: There's no need to carry out the family planning policy. C: At the beginning of 2030s the aging problem will be worse than now. D: In the year 2023, the population may be the least.","completion":"From the passage, we can learn the following about the population in China: A: After the year of 2023, the working population will likely experience a decline, falling by 8 million each year.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the premise and the hypothesis present contrasting views of the situation regarding Joyce's latest outing. Here, we will analyze both the premise and the hypothesis and explore their differences. Premise: \\"But contradictions abound in Joyce's latest outing.\\" The premise suggests that there are numerous contradictions, inconsistencies, or conflicting aspects in Joyce's recent outing. This may refer to contradictions within the plot, characters, or themes. It highlights a sense of confusion, disagreement, and unreliability about the information related to Joyce's outing. To better understand this premise, some examples of potential contradictions could be: 1. Joyce's stated intentions for the outing contradicted their observed behavior during the event. 2. The timeline of the events during the outing may not make logical sense or have inconsistencies. 3. Characters involved in the outing might have contradicting versions of the same events or stories. 4. Multiple aspects of the outing may be in direct conflict with each other, leading to a lack of clarity or coherence. Hypothesis: \\"Everything about Joyce's recent outing made sense and checked out.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that all aspects of Joyce's recent outing were coherent, logical, and consistent. This implies that there were no disagreements, confusions, or contradictions present in the plot, themes, or characters. Instead, the hypothesis presents a view wherein all elements can be understood and reconciled without any issues. The hypothesis promotes a sense of clarity, coherence, and reliability with regards to the description of Joyce's outing. Based on these analyses, it is apparent that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they present opposite views of the same situation. The premise focuses on the presence of contradictions, while the hypothesis emphasizes the absence of any inconsistencies or disagreements. Consequently, accepting one view would negate the other, making it impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is better described as contradictory rather than entailing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to when did three point line start in college??","completion":"The three-point line, which is an essential feature in modern basketball, was first introduced in the college basketball scene by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1980. The origin of the three-point line concept dates back to a few years before, and in college basketball, it was officially adopted during the 1980-1981 season. The three-point line's introduction aimed to change the gameplay dynamics by encouraging more perimeter shooting and offering an additional way to score points from distance, thus making the game more exciting for both fans and players alike. It has certainly had a significant impact on basketball strategies and how coaches devise their gameplans. The idea of the three-point line was first proposed by Howard Hobson, a basketball coach at the University of Oregon, in the 1930s. However, it took decades for the concept to be widely implemented and considered an elemental part of the sport. The American Basketball Association (ABA) was the first professional league to introduce the three-point line during the late 1960s. The NCAA introduced the three-point line at a distance of 19 feet, 9 inches (6.02 meters) for both men's and women's college basketball in 1980. With its introduction, several adjustments had to be made, including the spacing of players on offense, and defenders had to work on closing out perimeter shooters, making the game of basketball even more tactical. Over the years, the three-point line's distance in college basketball has been subject to modifications, particularly for the men's game. In 2008, the NCAA increased the distance to 20 feet, 9 inches (6.32 meters), and more recently, in the 2019-2020 season, they extended it further to match the international (FIBA) distance of 22 feet, 1¾ inches (6.75 meters). The current women's college basketball three-point line remains at 20 feet, 9 inches. These changes are intended to make college basketball more closely aligned with international standards and continue to challenge and evolve the skills of both coaches and players. The three-point line has undoubtedly played a significant role in revolutionizing basketball as a sport and fostered the development of a new generation of sharpshooters and more versatile players across college and professional basketball levels around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Kenyan midfielder made it clear his week that he felt Saints should have done more to keep the Argentinian boss. Wanyama has benefited under Pochettino's coaching where he has been used as a defensive screen in midfield and has notably reduced the number of goals Southampton concede when in the side. Earning his Spurs? Victor Wanyama (left) may follow his former boss Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham. And could use Suso as part of deal with Sevilla. He joined for £12million last summer and has struggled to settle though Pochettino has become a key figure in his career. Tottenham have question marks over the future of Chelsea target Paulinho, Sandro and Etienne Capoue who are both being considered by Napoli. Wanyama said: 'I learnt a lot from him, he taught me more and that's why I have grown as a player and there is a big difference compared to when I was at Celtic. Talking to Capital Sport, he added: 'He played a big role in my career development. 'I wanted him to remain because he had the passion for the club and I think the owners should not have let him go because the team can do better next season. It's a big blow because he had good connection with the players.' Gone: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take charge at St Mary's this week. Southampton already have offers for Luke. Shaw and Adam Lallana while Jay Rodriguez, Dejan Lovren, Morgan. Schneiderlin, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert are all attracting. attention from other clubs too. Southampton's board cannot afford to let. all of them go despite the temptation and that could affect Wanyama's. hopes. The 22-year-old had also been the subject of interest from Manchester City earlier in the season but they have been looking at other targets and a move to White Hart Lane would be his ideal. Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'We are in control of all the player transfers. All the top players are under long term contracts. Any transfers that take place will be under our terms. We will decide the terms to potential transfers in and out of the club. 'We will involve the manager. That is important for everybody to know. That's why we have been able to not agree to any transfers to date, because we have control of the situation, and anybody who is saying anything else doesn't understand that we are in a strong position with the Saints.' Erik Lamela will not be allowed to leave Tottenham on loan but the club are willing to sell for around £25million. That's the information being. circulated around Italian clubs at the moment and was reported on Sky. Italia on Thursday. Lamela's fortunes may change though under the tutelage of.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he’s going faster than skater 1 so he has more momentum. Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity. At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same.

When Flowers decides to take over a betting shop, owned by Joey Maddocks (Anthony Valentine), he forbids Chas to get involved, as he feels Chas's complicated personal history with Maddocks (which is at least partly gay) may lead to trouble. Chas is angry about this and later humiliates Maddocks, who retaliates by wrecking Chas's apartment and attacking Chas. Chas shoots him, packs a suitcase and runs from the scene. When Flowers makes it clear that he has no intention of offering protection to Chas but instead wants him eliminated, Chas decides to head for the countryside to hide but instead winds up hiding out in London, requesting that Tony (a trusted friend he refers to as 'Uncle') helps him get out of the country. He assumes a new name, Johnny Dean, and appears at the house of Turner (Mick Jagger), makes a clumsy attempt to ingratiate himself with Pherber (Anita Pallenberg), one of the female inhabitants, and moves in. Turner is a reclusive, eccentric former rock star who has \\"lost his demon\\", and who lives there with his female friends Pherber and Lucy (Michele Breton), with whom he enjoys a non-possessive and bisexual mÃ©nage Ã trois, and their child maid Lorraine (Laraine Wickens).

The phrase \\"less a story than an inexplicable nightmare\\" implies that the subject being discussed does not possess the qualities one would expect from a proper story, such as a coherent plot, structure, or character development. Instead, it is compared to an \\"inexplicable nightmare,\\" which implies an unpleasant, confusing, and disorienting experience. Furthermore, the addition of \\"right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror\\" illustrates that even the people within the context of this subject do not react strongly or with concern toward the unfolding horrors. The expression \\"shrugging acceptance\\" indicates apathy and a lack of emotional response, which often connotes a sense of powerlessness or despair. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment being conveyed, as the horrors being referenced are expected to provoke a strong emotional reaction, yet, they are met with a lack of concern or resistance. In conclusion, the given sentence evokes a negative sentiment, as it portrays the subject as having qualities similar to a disconcerting and confusing nightmare. Additionally, the indifferent attitude of the population toward the tragedies they face amplifies this negative feeling.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \\"Kong\\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack.

Summarize: Those seeking gender reassignment at one of England's eight centres face a further wait of more than three years. Under NHS guidelines, an initial appointment for hormone therapy and surgery should be within 18 weeks. NHS England said centres were limited due a shortage of \\"suitably qualified staff\\" but an additional Â£4m funding has been put into the services. A Transgender Equality report recommended an overhaul of the system, after noting \\"unacceptably long\\" waiting times. There are currently about 4,500 referrals to gender identity clinics in England per year, NHS England said. The House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee report said the demand for the clinics is growing at 25-30% each year. It said one of the largest clinics, based in London, has admitted that waiting times are \\"between 12 and 18 months\\" for an initial consultation. At the current rate, it is forecasting waiting times for physical surgery to be at three-and-a-half years, by 2017. Transgender people in the north west of England, where no clinics exists, are travelling to Leeds, Sheffield, the Midlands or London for treatment. Ashleigh Talbot, from Manchester, is receiving hormone treatment after receiving her prescription three years after first approaching her GP. With no clinics in her local area, she was referred to the Charing Cross clinic in London. \\"I've finally been on the hormones since August... after having initially spoken to my GP in 2012,\\" she said. \\"I elected to go [to London] because actually I was told by the community mental health team that the waiting time for Leeds would be an additional three years.\\" Transgender people are usually required to undergo hormone therapy for a year, before further consultations at a gender identity clinic. If surgery is deemed appropriate, they are given a consultation with a surgeon - all of whom have their own individual waiting lists. Before having any surgery to fully transition, patients must be seen by two psychiatrists - something transgender patient Dawn Pomfret believes adds to the stress of the situation unnecessarily. Ms Pomfret, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said: \\"I know one girl who was pushed back and pushed back purely because she didn't get on with her psychiatrist. \\"He wanted referral after referral and she should have got her surgery three years before she did.\\" The report noted that waiting times for initial appointments are in breach of patients' legal entitlement, under the NHS Constitution, which requires a first appointment in a specialist service within 18 weeks of referral. Will Huxter, chairman of NHS England's Gender Identity Task and Finish Group, said: \\"As with other specialised services, the number of gender identify centres around the country is limited primarily due to the shortage of suitably qualified and experienced staff. \\"However, we want to ensure that people are able to access services in a timely way wherever they live. \\"We recognise the urgent need to bring down waiting times, and to this end we have met with all the gender identity clinics to agree plans to increase capacity from April 2016.\\" NHS England is aiming to bring waiting times to below 18 weeks by 2018. Jenny Anne Bishop, of the Manchester-based TransForum help group, said: \\"We have the gender identity clinics, they're great for people who are struggling or who are not sure who they are. \\"But, for the average person who knows exactly who they are and where they want to go, we just need a doctor with specialist knowledge. \\"When the diagnosis is done the person could be referred for treatment and just get on with their lives.\\" The government is due to respond to the Women and Equalities Committee's findings in March. BBC Inside Out North West is on BBC1 from 19:30 GMT on Monday. Summary:","completion":"In England, individuals seeking gender reassignment at one of the country's eight centers are currently facing a wait of over three years. This waiting period is significantly longer than the 18 weeks recommended under NHS guidelines for an initial appointment regarding hormone therapy and surgery. NHS England has stated that the current waiting times are due to a lack of qualified staff. To help address this issue, an additional £4m in funding has been allocated to the services. The Transgender Equality report has called for an overhaul of the system, as the waiting times have been deemed unacceptably long. Each year, there are about 4,500 referrals to gender identity clinics in England, with a growing demand of 25-30% annually. NHS England is working to bring the waiting times down to below 18 weeks by 2018."},{"prompt":"Question: Claude Williams (politician) - Claude Williams (born November 25 1955 in Saint-Antoine New Brunswick) is a former civil servant and politician in the province of New Brunswick Canada.Williams studied at the University of Moncton graduating with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.

Kidder, one of five children, was born in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the daughter of Jocelyn Mary \\"Jill\\" (nee Wilson), a history teacher, and Kendall Kidder, an explosives expert and engineer. Kidder also spent time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her mother was from British Columbia, Canada, and her father was from New Mexico, United States. She is of Welsh and English descent. Kidder made her film debut in a 49-minute film titled The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar (1968), a drama set in a Canadian logging community, which was produced by the Challenge for Change. Her first major feature was the 1969 American film Gaily, Gaily, a comedy starring Beau Bridges. She appeared in a number of TV drama series for the CBC, including guest appearances on Wojeck, Adventures in Rainbow Country, and a semi-regular role as a young reporter on McQueen, and as a panelist on Mantrap which featured discussions centered on a feminist perspective. During the 1971-72 season, she co-starred as barmaid Ruth in Nichols, a James Garner western, which aired 22 episodes on NBC. In the late 1960s, Kidder was based in Toronto, and in 1970, relocated to Vancouver. During an August 3, 1970 interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Kidder stated that she was ambivalent toward having a film career, and was considering working as a film editor in the future. She appeared in \\"Such Dust As Dreams Are Made On\\", the first pilot for Harry O which aired in March 1973. She was a guest star in a 1972 episode of the George Peppard detective series Banacek. After moving to Los Angeles, Kidder was cast opposite Gene Wilder in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1970) as an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin whom she almost runs over with her car. After filming in Ireland, Kidder relocated to New York City to further study acting. A year later, she returned to California, and was cast in the Brian De Palma cult classic Sisters (1973), which gained notoriety for both director and Kidder, who as leading lady, portrayed conjoined twins. Kidder had been in a relationship with De Palma at the time, and had been roommates with co-star Jennifer Salt in Los Angeles. She then starred in the slasher film Black Christmas in 1974, for which she won a Canadian Film Award for Best Actress; followed by a role as a prostitute in the Terrence Malick-scripted The Gravy Train (1974). She received another Canadian Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the war drama A Quiet Day in Belfast (1974). In 1975, Kidder was cast in a lead role in The Great Waldo Pepper opposite Robert Redford, she also appeared in The Reincarnation of Peter Proud and 92 in the Shade (1975) with Peter Fonda, all of which established her as a commercially viable leading lady. Kidder famously married the director of 92 in the Shade, Thomas McGuane. She appeared on the March 9, 1975 edition of The American Sportsman, learning how to hang glide with her providing the narration and a remote microphone recording her reactions in flight; the segment concluded with Kidder doing solos soaring amid the Wyoming Rockies. After taking a break from acting after the birth of her daughter in 1976, Kidder sought to return to making films in the late 1970s. After doing a reading of Lois Lane for the 1978 superhero film Superman: The Movie, Kidder was flown to England by Richard Donner for screen-tests. Donner ultimately cast Kidder in the role, which would become her most iconic. Filming took over a year, and the film was released during Christmas 1978, to major commercial success. Kidder won a Saturn Award for best actress for her performance in the film. Kidder publicly disagreed with the decision of producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind to replace Richard Donner as director for Superman II (1980). It was reported that as a result, Kidder's role in Superman III (1983) consisted of less than five minutes of footage, though the producers have denied this in DVD commentaries. Her role in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) was more substantial. Kidder's performance as Kathy Lutz in the 1979 summer release of The Amityville Horror further cemented her status as one of Hollywood's leading ladies. Though it received mixed reviews from critics, The Amityville Horror was a major commercial success, grossing over 86 million in the United States. Janet Maslin of The New York Times, though giving the film a mixed review, said Kidder \\"stubbornly remains the bright-eyed life of the party [in the film].\\" In retrospect, Kidder called the film \\"a piece of shit.\\" The same year, Kidder hosted an episode of the American sketch comedy TV show Saturday Night Live. Kidder continued to work in film throughout the 1980s, appearing in Paul Mazursky's Willie & Phil and Some Kind of Hero. Her performance in 1981's Heartaches generated critical acclaim and Oscar buzz. As court stenographer-cum-private eye Mickey Raymond, the PG rating that 1983's Trenchcoat received led Disney to launch Touchstone Pictures. She appeared opposite James Garner in the controversial Hollywood crime drama The Glitter Dome (1984). In 1985, she toplined Little Treasure for Columbia Tri-Star with co-stars Ted Danson and Burt Lancaster, where she played a distraught stripper looking for her bank robber-father's buried fortune. In 1986 she was selected as the English narrator for the Japanese animated series The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. A 1982 stage performance of Bus Stop starring Kidder as Cherie and Tim Matheson as Bo, was broadcast on HBO. In 1983, she produced and starred as Eliza Doolittle in a version of Pygmalion with Peter O'Toole for Showtime. She produced and starred in the French-Canadian period television film Louisiana (1984) as a plantation owner in the American South who returns from Paris to find her estate and holdings have been lost. Body of Evidence (1988), a CBS Movie of the Week, cast Kidder as nurse who is suspicious that her medical pathologist second husband is a serial killer. In 1994, Kidder played the bartender at the Broken Skull Tavern in Under a Killing Moon, an IBM PC adventure game. In 1994 she took time to appear in the Disney Channel movie WindRunner, with Russell Means and Jason Wiles. She made uncredited cameo appearances in Maverick (1994) and Delirious (1991). By the mid-1990s, Kidder's career began to decline, which was attributed to her widely publicized nervous breakdown in 1996. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: who was one of her co-stars?","completion":"One of Margot Kidder's notable co-stars was Gene Wilder with whom she was cast opposite in the movie \\"Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx\\" (1970). Kidder was an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin, a role played by Wilder. This was after Kidder had moved to Los Angeles. Another key co-star was Beau Bridges, alongside whom Kidder starred in her first major American feature film \\"Gaily, Gaily\\" in 1969 which was a comedy genre. She also starred opposite James Garner in the controversial Hollywood crime drama \\"The Glitter Dome\\" (1984). However, her most iconic co-star was probably Christopher Reeve, with whom she starred in \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (1978).

Performance art via kayak at Fort Point There's a choice little piece of waterfront property along Fort Point Channel, snug to the Summer Street Bridge along the Harbor Walk. Early last week, the place was surrounded by a picket fence and had a “For Rent” sign up. So what if it’s only 8 feet square, and floating in the channel. It looked darling in the late afternoon sun — at least until a redheaded woman in a business suit arrived in a kayak and started renovating. She tore down part of the fence, built a desk, and picked up a phone. Heidi Kayser’s “The Remodeling Project’’ is the fifth installment in the Floating Art Series. Welcome to “The Remodeling Project,” the latest installment of Fort Point's Floating Art Series, and the first one featuring performance art. The woman in the chic black suit was artist Heidi Kayser. She enlisted a builder in Maine to make the square wooden dock, and throughout the month, she’ll be kayaking out periodically to her little patch of paradise and changing it up. This weekend, the artist may have the biggest audience of the month, with Fort Point Art Walk, an open studios event, which began Friday and continues through Sunday, from noon to 5 p.m. Originally, Kayser says, she had thought to call the project “The American Dream.” “What does it mean to be successful?” she asks. “A picket fence? A suit?” Or maybe it’s a little piece of real estate. “It’s about what we do with our space,” Kayser says. “If you’re lucky, you have a yard. A cubicle. My studio in the South End is about that size.” On a sunny day last week, she stood on a dock outside the Barking Crab restaurant, conspicuous in her black suit, packing her blue kayak and a raft to tow out to her floating venue. Among her props: a dozen phones, a desk chair, the makings of a desk, and patent leather pumps. As she tends her personal space in full view of passersby, Kayser says, she explores the edge between public and private. When she was on the dock erecting the picket fence in early May, she recounts, “someone on the bridge said something like ‘What are you doing? It ain’t like nobody can come get you.’ The fence is 13 inches tall. It's a symbol of a fence.” Every performance will be distinct, inspired in part by ideas Kayser has culled from an Internet survey, asking people to free-associate about specific words, including private, public, home, work, domestic, commute, and woman. Some responses were poetic, the artist says. “For ‘private,’ someone wrote [that] at night they ‘hide in little boxes.’ ” “It’s about what we do with our space,” Kayser says of her 8-foot-square project. “If you’re lucky, you have a yard. A cubicle. My studio in the South End is about that size.” Kayser has lots of boxes these days — this summer she’s moving from Boston to San Diego, where she’ll work toward a master of fine arts degree from the University of California. So she's considering taking some of the boxes out to the floating dock and hiding in them. When not in a box, she might do some ironing out there, or put up a mailbox. For one performance, she envisions mixing up the imagined scenarios, floating on the platform along with a garden gnome, an ironing board, and office furniture. The project is getting attention. One passerby last weekend took a picture of the dock with the fence and the “For Rent” sign before Kayser arrived on the scene. “I'm thinking about posting on Facebook, saying ‘I need my own island,’ ” said the woman, who declined to give her name. “The neighborhood is totally intrigued,” reports Gabrielle Schaffner, executive director of Fort Point Arts Community, which presents the Floating Art Series. Schaffner must seek permission from the Boston Harbormaster for every project in the Floating Art Series, which is funded partially by the nonprofit Friends of Fort Point Channel. The mark of a successful public art project, she says, “is when people stop to take pictures. This one is such a double take, even if you're used to seeing public art projects pop up around here.” “The Remodeling Project” is the fifth in the Floating Art Series, which officially debuted in 2005. The community’s jury for this year's Floating Art Series leaped at Kayser’s proposal. “It's completely different than anything we’ve ever done,” Schaffner says, adding that jurors had confidence in Kayser’s track record. She's a curator as well as an artist, and founder of the Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media. The Hull Lifesaving Museum, which keeps a pier down by the Barking Crab, has lent the artist a slip for her kayak. Preparing to tow out her office equipment on this May afternoon, she lashed an orange push broom to the kayak, along with the desk chair. \\"I'm worried that my desk might fall into the channel,” she says, noting the choppy water. “I need to clamp it to the dock.” The project, which began with the erection of the picket fence and the “For Rent” sign, will conclude when Kayser puts a “For Sale” sign out on her platform. So even though you probably can’t keep it in Fort Point Channel, that little piece of paradise could be yours, for the right price.

Available options: +boil it for five minutes.; +boil it for half an hour.; Answer:","completion":"The best way to make a potato soft is to boil it for an appropriate amount of time, taking into consideration factors such as the type, size, and purpose of the potato dish you are preparing. Boiling a potato for five minutes would be insufficient, as it will only partially cook the potato and not result in the soft texture desired. Boiling a potato for half an hour is a better option but might be too long for some instances, or it could cause overcooking, leading to a mushy texture. Here's a detailed recommendation for boiling potatoes to achieve a soft texture: 1. Select the right type of potato: Starchy potatoes such as russets or Idaho are more suitable for achieving a soft, fluffy texture. For dishes that require a firm yet soft texture like potato salad, waxy potatoes such as red or fingerling potatoes are preferable. 2. Wash and peel the potatoes (optional): Washing removes any dirt or debris from the surface. Depending on the dish you're preparing, you might choose to peel the potatoes or leave the skin on. If you prefer to keep the skin, make sure it's thoroughly cleaned. 3. Cut the potatoes into uniform sizes (optional): Cutting the potatoes into evenly sized pieces ensures that they cook uniformly. This step is particularly important if you're preparing a dish that requires consistent texture, such as mashed potatoes or potato salad. 4. Place the potatoes in a pot: Add the potatoes to a large pot with enough water to cover them by at least an inch. You may add a pinch of salt to the water to enhance the flavor. 5. Bring the water to a boil: Place the pot on the stove over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. Once it reaches a boil, you may reduce the heat to medium or medium-high, maintaining a steady simmer. 6. Adjust the boiling time according to the size and type of potato: The ideal boiling time depends on the size and type of potato. In general, small and medium-sized potatoes should be boiled for 15-20 minutes, while large potatoes may require 25-30 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by poking them with a fork, which should slide in easily when they are soft enough. Waxy potatoes generally take a little longer to soften than starchy potatoes. 7. Drain the potatoes: Once the potatoes have reached the desired softness, carefully drain the water using a colander or strainer. Allow the potatoes to steam off for a minute or so to remove any excess moisture. By following these steps and adjusting the boiling time based on the type and size of potatoes, you can achieve the perfect, soft texture for various potato dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now they had nothing except the old house and they had no money to buy any food. They thought for a long time. Then they decided to sell the house and look for their father. So one day the two brothers said goodbye to their friends and started to go. They got to the station and bought two tickets. They were afraid that they would be hungry in the train, so they went to the market to buy something to eat. They saw bananas for the first time. The seller told them the bananas were very delicious, so they bought five kilos and got on the train with them. After a while Bruce brought out a banana and bit a little. Just at that moment the train went into a tunnel and it was dark in the train.

The fact that their father had not yet contacted them in two months could indicate that he was struggling to find suitable employment. B) They didn't hear from their father: Bruce and Bruno's father had promised to write to them as soon as he found a job. The extended period of silence since his departure was becoming a cause of concern for the two brothers. They were understandably anxious about their father's well-being. C) Their father left them far away: The distance between their home and the town where their father went for work meant that the brothers could not easily visit him or know what was happening with him. As a result, they were left feeling vulnerable and disconnected from their beloved father. D) They had no money to buy any food: The absence of their father, who was the family's primary breadwinner, had led to financial struggles for Bruce and Bruno. The lack of money for necessities such as food added to their worries and further reinforced their decision to sell their old house and search for their father.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits? Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\".

Options: - medicine cabinet - barber shop - bath room - grocery store - suitcase Explain why a human would choose \\"barber shop\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"barber shop\\" to answer the question above because a barber shop is a traditional establishment where haircare and grooming services are provided, including hair cutting, shaving, and trimming. In these establishments, skilled professionals known as barbers use various tools and equipment to perform these services, one of which is a razor. Razors are used for different purposes within a barber shop. They can be utilized for shaving facial hair or even for achieving precise, clean lines when giving haircuts. Traditional barber shops often have a classic ambiance and a considerable customer base who appreciates the close shaves and well-executed haircuts provided by experienced barbers. Razors have been an essential tool of the trade for many years and are often considered a symbol of the barber profession, making the barber shop a fitting place to find a razor. In contrast, the other options presented – medicine cabinet, bathroom, grocery store, and suitcase – may have some connections to razors but are not specifically dedicated to their use like a barber shop would be. A medicine cabinet may contain razors in a personal context within a household, but this location is not a traditional public establishment where razors would typically be provided or used. Similarly, a bathroom could have personal razors, but razors are not the primary focus of bathrooms, which are designed for an array of hygienic activities. A grocery store may sell razors, but again, this is not its primary function, and the store carries a vast range of products beyond grooming supplies. Lastly, a suitcase is merely a transportation device, which may contain a razor packed for personal use while traveling, but it is not a traditional location where one would specifically go to find a razor. Given these explanations, it becomes clear that a human would choose \\"barber shop\\" because it represents a traditional establishment where the primary functions revolve around grooming services, including the use of razors. Barber shops have a deep-rooted historical significance in providing these services, and they remain popular places to find and utilize razors in a professional context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays an important role in vascular pathobiology, being involved in the development of coronary restenosis and atherosclerosis. The activation of nuclear proto-oncogenes appears to be a final common pathway onto which various mitogenic signals coverage. Accordingly, we attempted to determine whether the activation of the c-myc nuclear proto-oncogene is essential for human SMC proliferation and explored the possibility of inhibiting their growth using antisense oligonucleotides directed against c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA).', 'Proliferation of human SMCs was associated with an increase in c-myc mRNA expression after growth stimulation. Using 15-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (oligomers), we tested their growth-inhibitory effect in SMCs in vitro. Antisense oligomers directed against the translation initiation region of the human c-myc gene exhibited a significant antiproliferative effect, whereas sense and mismatched oligomers did not inhibit the growth. The growth-inhibitory effect of c-myc antisense oligomers was dose dependent and preventable by an excess of sense oligomers. Furthermore, growth inhibition of SMCs treated with c-myc antisense oligomers was associated with a marked decrease in the c-myc mRNA level. Phosphorothioate oligomers remained stable in medium containing 20% serum and were detectable in SMCs as early as 1 hour after cell exposure. Intact oligomers rapidly accumulated intracellularly and persisted within human SMCs for at least 16 hours. Answer: c-myc antisense oligomers reduced c-myc expression and produced a significant growth inhibition of human SMCs, indicating an important role of c-myc gene activation in the process of SMC proliferation. Furthermore, extracellular stability and rapid cellular uptake provide the basis for future studies assessing the therapeutic role of the c-myc antisense approach in reducing SMC proliferation in the process of vascular restenosis.","completion":"Task: Construct a question based on the given passage and answer, making sure that the question is unambiguous, answerable from the passage, has a unique answer, and utilizes text phrases from the passage.

From the early stages of Christianity, belief in the virginity of Mary and the virgin conception of Jesus, as stated in the gospels, holy and supernatural, was used by detractors, both political and religious, as a topic for discussions, debates and writings, specifically aimed to challenge the divinity of Jesus and thus Christians and Christianity alike. In the 2nd century, as part of the earliest anti-Christian polemics, Celsus suggested that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier named Panthera.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What is amplified by playback equipment? A:","completion":"The playback equipment amplifies the bass frequencies. This is part of the equalization process enacted to restore the tonal balance in the original signal, which ensures the sound fidelity of the music as it was intended to be heard. During the recording process, the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced to minimize the groove width required, thus allowing more music to fit onto the record. The playback equipment compensates for this reduction by boosting the bass frequencies.

Question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley; September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was an American country music singer and part of the Nashville sound during the late 1950s and early 1960s. She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer. Patsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia, in the city's Memorial Hospital. She was the eldest child of seamstress Hilda Virginia (nee Patterson, 1916-1998) and blacksmith Samuel Lawrence Hensley (1889-1956). She had a brother Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister Sylvia. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children's home was reportedly happy nonetheless. When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. She later said, \\"The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\\" Cline enrolled at John Handley High School but never attended classes. To help her mother support their family, she worked as a soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and a waitress at the Triangle Diner. She watched performers through the window at the local radio station, and she asked WINC (AM) disc jockey Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs wearing fringed Western outfits that her mother made from Patsy's designs. Cline performed in variety and talent shows in the Winchester and Tri-State areas, and she gained a large following through the shows and local radio appearances. Jimmy Dean was already a country star in 1954, and she became a regular with him on Connie B. Gay's Town and Country Jamboree radio show on WAVA (AM) in Arlington County, Virginia.

Abstract: Resistance to apoptosis is an important component of the overall mechanism which drives the tumorigenic process. EBV is a ubiquitous human gamma-herpesvirus which preferentially establishes latent infection in viral infected B-lymphocytes. EBNA1 is typically expressed in most forms of EBV-positive malignancies and is important for replication of the latent episome in concert with replication of the host cells. Here, we investigate the effects of EBNA1 on survivin up-regulation in EBV-infected human B-lymphoma cells. We present evidence which demonstrates that EBNA1 forms a complex with Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins bound to their cis-element at the survivin promoter. This enhances the activity of the complex and up-regulates survivin. Knockdown of survivin and EBNA1 showed enhanced apoptosis in infected cells and thus supports a role for EBNA1 in suppressing apoptosis in EBV-infected cells. Here, we suggest that EBV encoded EBNA1 can contribute to the oncogenic process by up-regulating the apoptosis suppressor protein, survivin in EBV-associated B-lymphoma cells..

Plot title: Judgment at Nuremberg Movie plot: Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) arrives in Nuremberg in 1948 to preside over the trial of four Nazi judges, each charged with having abused the court system to help cleanse Germany of the politically and socially undesirable, allegedly guilty of war crimes. The opening statement of the prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) is a vicious one, depicting the defendants as having been willing, evil, accomplices in Nazi atrocities, but Judge Haywood wonders if it is really that simple.Confounded at how one defendant, a renowned German champion of justice named Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), appears to have played the greatest role in molding Germany's Ministry of Justice into a destructive instrument of Nazism, Judge Haywood resolves to gain some perspective on the period in which the German legal system strayed from a course of entirely objective justice.Probing for the truth proves difficult, though, as nobody who lived in Germany during Nazism seems to admit to having much inside knowledge. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the widow of an executed Nazi army officer, but she offers few insights, more consumed by her personal experiences than the broader matters of Nazism. Mrs. Bertholt is focusing on being a catalyst for the cultural rebirth of Nuremberg, keen on remolding the image of a city that had become notorious as the site of the Nazi raliies. An attempt to discuss the period with his housekeepers, Mr. and Mrs. Halbestadt, who had lived near the Dachau concentration camp, proves equally fruitless for Judge Haywood, as they cannot help but focus on the loss of their child in the bombing and the fact that they nearly starved from poverty. Whether anyone knew anything mattered little, for Germans were looking forward, not backward, still grappling with, and recovering from, the hardships and losses that the war brought to them and their families.Only in the courtroom will Judge Haywood have the opportunity to gain insights into the realities of the period.

Information: - A subcarrier is a sideband of a radio frequency carrier wave, which is modulated to send additional information. Examples include the provision of colour in a black and white television system or the provision of stereo in a monophonic radio broadcast. There is no physical difference between a carrier and a subcarrier; the \\"sub\\" implies that it has been derived from a carrier, which has been amplitude modulated by a steady signal and has a constant frequency relation to it. - A radio reading service or reading service for the blind is a service of many universities, community groups and public radio stations, where a narrator reads books, newspapers and magazines aloud for the benefit of the blind and vision-impaired. It is most often carried on a subcarrier, with radio receivers permanently tuned to a given station in the area, or an HD Radio subchannel of the offering station. Some reading services use alternative methods for reaching their audiences, including broadcasting over SAP, streaming Internet radio, cable TV, or even terrestrial TV. - 6RPH Vision Australia Radio broadcasts on 990 kHz AM and was previously owned and operated by the Foundation for Information Radio of Western Australia Inc. It now broadcasts Vision Australia Radio and aims to provide access to printed information for Western Australians with a print disability . Vision Australia Radio is a member of RPH Australia . Its radio reading service is available on 990 AM throughout the wider Perth metropolitan area . However , in the early part of 2015 the station started to play a recorded music loop , together with a repeated announcement that its service had been suspended due to \`\` technical issues '' . In March / early April 2015 , 6RPH ceased broadcasting , but has since recommenced transmission with the Vision Australia Radio service on 990AM and on IRIS digital . Radio 6PM occupied the 990 kHz frequency until the late 1980s . - HD Radio is a trademarked term for iBiquity's in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio technology used by AM and FM radio stations to transmit audio and data by using a digital signal embedded on-frequency immediately above and below a station's standard analog signal, providing the means to listen to the same program in either HD (digital radio with less noise) or as a standard broadcast (analog radio with standard sound quality). The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station's analog channel. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If the thermostat is set to a higher temperature, it will sense that the room temperature is lower compared to the desired temperature. This will cause the thermostat to send a signal to the heating system, initiating the sequence that ultimately results in more heat being produced: 1. Heating oil travels from the tank to the burner. 2. The oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air. 3. The oil/air combination is injected into the burner. 4. The burner is ignited in the combustion chamber. 5. The furnace heats the air. 6. The blower sends the heated air through the ducts. 7. The heated air comes out the vents and into the room.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What became France's main rival on the imperial stage? , can you please find it? Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

A:","completion":"In the 18th century, England (which became Britain after the union with Scotland in 1707) emerged as the world's dominant colonial power, with France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage. The rivalry between the two nations heightened during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. The Dutch, who were initially competing with England for colonial supremacy, gradually shifted their focus towards European conflicts, thereby increasing the prominence of France as Britain's main rival. The Nine Years' War (1688-1697) saw England and the Netherlands ally against France and Spain. The conflict took place both in Europe and overseas, but the outcome left England as a stronger colonial power compared to the Dutch, as the latter had to allocate more resources to the costly land war in Europe. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) further intensified the rivalry between Britain and France. The war began after the death of Charles II of Spain, who left his throne and colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France. The prospect of unification between France, Spain, and their respective colonies was unacceptable to Britain and other European powers. England, Portugal, and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the conflict. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 marked the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Under the treaty, Philippe renounced his claim to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. Britain gained valuable territories from both France and Spain, including Newfoundland and Acadia from France, and Gibraltar and Menorca from Spain. Gibraltar became a crucial naval base for Britain, enabling them to control the entry and exit points to the Mediterranean. Additionally, Spain ceded the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain, further strengthening the British Empire. In summary, France became Britain's main rival on the imperial stage during the 18th century, with the rivalry intensifying during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. The Dutch, who were previously prominent competitors, shifted their focus towards European conflicts, leaving France as Britain's primary contender for colonial dominance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The US believes that al-Qaeda affiliates in the war-torn country are actively attempting to recruit Americans there and train them to carry out attacks back home, senior intelligence and counterterror officials tell the New York Times. At least 70 Americans have traveled to Syria or attempted to since the war began three years ago, the officials revealed. Most haven't returned, but the FBI is monitoring those who have. \\"We are focused on trying to figure out what our people are up to,\\" FBI Director James Comey told reporters yesterday. A handful of those who've returned are under direct around-the-clock surveillance. One man, former US Army soldier Eric Harroun of Phoenix, was charged last year with fighting alongside the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front; he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was released. But despite all the worry about Islamist groups, the Obama administration is considering resuming shipments of non-lethal aid to the rebels, notes another Times report—even if some of it ends up in militants' hands.","completion":"Title: The FBI's Vigilance on American Returnees from Syria and its Implications Introduction The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has made it a significant priority to monitor Americans traveling to and returning from war-torn Syria. With growing concerns over al-Qaeda affiliates' attempts to recruit and train American citizens for potential attacks on U.S. soil, senior counterterrorism officials are keeping a close watch on these individuals. Since the war in Syria began, there have been at least 70 cases of Americans traveling to or attempting to travel to Syria. Most of these individuals have not returned, but the FBI has been monitoring their activities. In this article, we will discuss the FBI's surveillance strategies, the impact of these strategies on domestic security, and the implications of these actions for U.S. foreign policy. FBI Surveillance Strategies The FBI is making considerable efforts to track and monitor Americans who have been to Syria and returned. According to FBI Director James Comey, the agency is \\"focused on trying to figure out what our people are up to.\\" For some returnees, this means being under direct, around-the-clock surveillance. In one particular case, former U.S. Army soldier Eric Harroun of Phoenix was charged with fighting alongside the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. Harroun ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was released. Through these investigations, the FBI aims to prevent potential homegrown terrorists from carrying out attacks in the United States. Implications for Domestic Security There is a great deal at stake for domestic security when it comes to tracking American returnees from Syria. According to a report in the New York Times, al-Qaeda operatives in Syria are actively trying to recruit and train Americans for potential attacks. So far, there have been no reported incidences of homegrown terrorist attacks as a result of recruitment from Syria. However, the FBI's vigilance ensures that there is a better chance of preventing such attacks before they occur. By monitoring those who have been to Syria and are suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda or other extremist groups, the FBI can take preemptive measures to safeguard national security. Implications for U.S. Foreign Policy The Obama administration has been engaged in an ongoing debate regarding the shipment of non-lethal aid to the rebels in Syria. Many critics argue that such assistance could end up in the hands of militants who pose a threat to the United States. Nonetheless, reports suggest that the administration is considering resuming shipments of non-lethal aid to the rebels. The FBI's investigations into American returnees from Syria provide a crucial perspective on the risks of such support. By carefully examining the motivations and activities of these individuals, the U.S. government can make decisions about the extent and nature of their support for the Syrian opposition. Conclusion The FBI's close watch on Americans who have returned from Syria serves as an important strategy for U.S. domestic security. These individuals may have been exposed to extremist ideologies, and even trained to conduct attacks on American soil. By monitoring their activities, the FBI can work to prevent future attacks and ultimately safeguard citizens. Additionally, these investigations can play a crucial role in informing U.S. foreign policy decisions, particularly regarding support for the Syrian opposition. In an uncertain and complex global landscape, the FBI's vigilance is a vital tool for understanding and managing the risks associated with the Syrian war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered.

The victory was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts, garrisons and cities (of which there were at least two) east of the Rhine; the remaining two Roman legions in Germania, commanded by Varus' nephew Lucius Nonius Asprenas, were content to try to hold the Rhine. One fort, Aliso, most likely located in today's Haltern am See, fended off the Germanic tribes for many weeks, perhaps even a few months. After the situation became untenable, the garrison under Lucius Caedicius, accompanied by survivors of Teutoburg Forest, broke through the siege, and reached the Rhine. They resisted long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine with two legions and Tiberius to arrive with a new army, preventing Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul. What's the best answer to this question: did any romans survive the battle of teutoburg forest?","completion":"Yes, some Romans did survive the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, albeit not many. The battle, which took place in 9 CE between the Roman Legions and the Germanic tribes led by Arminius, resulted in a devastating loss for the Romans. Their three legions were all but annihilated, but not every Roman soldier perished in the battle. From the account, we learn of a fort named Aliso, likely situated in present-day Haltern am See. Following the disastrous battle, this fort withstood the subsequent assault from the triumphant Germanic tribes for an extended period, possibly even for a few months. It is reasonable to infer that some of the Romans at this fort were likely survivors of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. The fort's garrison, commanded by Lucius Caedicius, and likely composed of battle survivors, managed a daring breakout from the fort when the situation became unsustainable. They managed to penetrate the Germanic siege successfully and headed towards the Rhine. Their staunch resistance provided crucial time for Lucius Nonius Asprenas, the nephew of Varus and the commander of the remaining two legions in Germania, to fortify the Roman defenses on the Rhine. It also bought time for Tiberius to arrive with a new army, thereby preventing Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul. Hence, while the Roman defeat was comprehensive and brutal, some soldiers did survive the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. Their survival and subsequent resistance played a critical role in ensuring that the Germanic tribes led by Arminius were not able to capitalize fully on their resounding victory by invading Gaul."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This event, also known as D-Day, involved the combined forces of the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and other Allied countries, with the objective of liberating Western Europe from Nazi control during World War II. The operation targeted an approximately 80 km (50-mile) stretch of the Normandy coastline, which was divided into five landing zones assigned to different Allied forces. These beaches were codenamed: Utah and Omaha for the United States, Gold and Sword for Britain, and Juno for Canada. The amphibious landings were followed by a major airborne assault, involving thousands of paratroopers deployed behind enemy lines to support the main attack. Under the leadership of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the extensive planning and coordination of forces led to a significant foothold in German-occupied France. The success of the Normandy landings set the stage for the eventual liberation of France and played a critical role in the Allied victory on the Western Front in World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Known for his signature style in works such as \\"300\\" (2006) and \\"Watchmen\\" (2009), Snyder delivered a gripping story that tackles themes such as empowerment, self-discovery, and rebellion. This article will explore the movie's complex narrative, its breathtaking visuals, and the poignant messages it conveys. Step 1: Analyze the Plot: \\"Sucker Punch\\" initially presents itself as a story about a young woman, Babydoll (Emily Browning), committed to a mental institution by a vile stepfather. Soon after her arrival, reality shifts, and Babydoll finds herself in a twisted fantasy world within her own mind. Teaming up with four other female inmates, Babydoll embarks on a mission to escape her mental imprisonment by acquiring various objects. The film encapsulates the struggle of these women as they fight both internal and external battles. Step 2: Discuss the Visual Style: Snyder employs his signature visual prowess in \\"Sucker Punch,\\" combining the aesthetics of comic book art and video game design. The vivid colors, slo-mo action sequences, and near-photorealistic visuals create an unforgettable experience for the viewers. The film brims with intricate details, from stunning costumes to intricately designed sets, immersing the audience into the captivating world that Snyder has created. Step 3: Explore the Themes: Throughout \\"Sucker Punch,\\" the motif of empowerment runs strong. Babydoll and her team of warriors learn to harness their individual strengths and, together, they gradually discover their collective power. Despite their circumstances, these young women choose to rebel and fight back against their oppressors. Additionally, the film's multilayered narrative delves into the concept of reality versus illusion. While some argue that the visually immersive fantasy sequences are merely a distraction, others see them as a reflection of Babydoll's psyche, where she copes with her trauma and seeks solace and strength. Step 4: Analyze the Characters: The primary characters in \\"Sucker Punch\\" are multidimensional, demonstrating both vulnerability and strength. Babydoll's transformation from a frightened young girl into an empowered leader is nothing short of inspiring. Moreover, the camaraderie between the female characters showcases the importance of solidarity and shared purpose. Each character has a unique backstory, which serves as a catalyst for their growth throughout the film. Step 5: Discuss Reception and Legacy: While \\"Sucker Punch\\" received mixed reviews upon its release, it has since gained a cult following, with fans deeply appreciating its complex narrative, visual prowess, and subtext. The film has inspired debate and discourse, with some praising it as a feminist masterpiece and others critiquing it for objectification. Conclusion: 'Sucker Punch' remains one of the most intriguing entries in Zack Snyder's filmography. With its stunning visual style, layered narrative, and thought-provoking themes, the movie delivers a cinematic experience that, to this day, remains unparalleled. It invites viewers to ponder the lines between reality and imagination while reminding us that sometimes, our greatest battles are fought within."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

If the cover is made of a delicate material like silk, you'll want to run it through a separate, delicate wash. It is essential to be gentle with these fragile fabrics to ensure they remain in good condition and maintain their luxurious feel. When washing silk covers, it's recommended to use a mild detergent that is specifically designed for delicate items. Cold water is preferable, as hot water can damage the fabric's fibers and lead to shrinkage or discoloration. Handwashing is another option for extra precaution, as it helps prevent potential damage from agitators and rough handling in a washing machine. If the cover is made of silk, make sure to air dry the cover instead of putting it in your dryer, as the heat can cause it to shrink or get damaged. Lay the cover flat on a clean, dry surface, and allow it to air dry naturally, preferably away from direct sunlight, which may cause the color to fade over time. Once completely dry, you can gently iron the cover with a low heat setting for a smooth, elegant finish, making sure not to scorch the silk fabric."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did education impact the country?\\" is in \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\".

Glacier Ogives are alternating wave crests and valleys that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces. They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier. Ogives are formed when ice from an icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer. This creates a swale and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in turn creates a ridge. Sometimes ogives consist only of undulations or color bands and are described as wave ogives or band ogives. Q: How are ogives formed?","completion":"Ogives are formed through a step-by-step process involving seasonal motion of glaciers, icefalls, and varying ablation rates: 1. Seasonal motion of glaciers: The width of one dark and one light band in an ogive generally corresponds to the annual movement of the glacier, indicating a link between ogive formation and the glacier's seasonal motion. 2. Icefalls: Icefalls occur when ice from the glacier moves over a steep cliff or edge, causing the ice to break up severely. This broken ice plays a role in the formation of ogives. 3. Increased ablation surface area: When ice is broken up by an icefall, the ablation surface area increases during the summer. Ablation refers to the loss of glacial ice due to melting, evaporation, or other processes. 4. Formation of swales and ridges: The increased ablation creates a swale (a shallow depression) and makes room for snow accumulation during the winter. This accumulated snow then forms a ridge, contributing to the formation of ogives. 5. Alternating wave crests and valleys: The combination of swales and ridges ultimately results in alternating wave crests and valleys on the glacier's surface, appearing as dark and light bands of ice, which are referred to as ogives. In some cases, ogives may consist only of undulations or color bands, which are described as wave ogives or band ogives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Information: - Amoraim (Aramaic: plural , singular Amora ; \\"those who say\\" or \\"those who speak over the people\\", or \\"spokesmen\\") refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \\"said\\" or \\"told over\\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification. - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew : , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native... - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar. - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\"). - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne. - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters. - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\"). - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest. - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written. - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath. - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE 70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.

Scroll down for video James Tyrwhitt-Drake from the University of Victoria in Canada has created a high-definition video of planet Earth (still from the video shown). In it Earth is seen rotating with the sun sweeping across the surface. He used images from a Russian weather satellite The video uses images captured by the geostationary","completion":"Electro-L weather satellite, which was launched by Russia in 2011. The satellite is positioned above the Earth's equator, about 36,000 kilometers (22,369 miles) away from the surface, and it captures high-resolution images of our planet every 30 minutes. Here's a step-by-step process of how the time-lapse was created using these images: Step 1: Collect the images First, to create the time-lapse, James Tyrwhitt-Drake had to collect thousands of images captured by the Russian weather satellite Electro-L. These images provide a detailed view of both the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth. Step 2: Clean and enhance the images After collecting the raw satellite images, each image needed to be processed to remove any artifacts, noise, or inconsistencies. This step ensures that the final time-lapse will be smooth and visually pleasing. Additionally, color corrections and adjustments were made to enhance the overall appearance of the images, giving them a more vibrant and realistic look. Step 3: Align the images Since the images were taken from a geostationary satellite, they would already be consistent in terms of perspective and orientation. However, to ensure that the final time-lapse is smooth and seamless, each image was carefully aligned with the previous image in the sequence. This step ensures that there are no abrupt jumps or shifts in the position of the Earth as it rotates in the time-lapse video. Step 4: Create the time-lapse sequence Once the images were cleaned, enhanced, and aligned, they were then combined into a time-lapse sequence using specialized software. This software stitched the images together, creating a smooth and seamless video showing the Earth's rotation over an extended period. The final result is a stunning 4K resolution time-lapse video showing the Earth's surface as it rotates, with the sun appearing to move across the surface due to Earth's rotation. Step 5: Share the video Finally, after completing the time-lapse, James Tyrwhitt-Drake shared the video online which allows people around the world to witness the incredible sight of our planet in stunning HD. By sharing the video online, audiences can appreciate the beauty and complexity of our Earth, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding and protecting our environment. In conclusion, the process of creating this amazing time-lapse involved collecting images from a Russian weather satellite, processing and enhancing the images, aligning them, creating the time-lapse sequence, and sharing the video for viewers to enjoy. This incredible video provides a unique perspective on our planet and the speed of its rotation, as seen from space."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is impossible to definitively determine the exact source or nature of the sound. The passage describes several potential sources for the sound, including a shoe squeaking, a stomach gurgle, a burp, the leather on someone's chair moving, or even a fart. These are just a few examples of the countless possibilities that could be responsible for the noise. The sound could have been produced by a myriad of everyday audible phenomena or even a combination of multiple sources. However, there is a clue in the passage that offers a hint as to what the sound may have been. After the unidentified noise occurred, the person in question reacted by exclaiming, \\"OH! Excuse me!\\" This reaction suggests that the sound could have been a personal bodily function that typically requires an apology, such as a burp or a fart. Still, this information, while providing some insight, is not enough to definitively identify the source of the sound. It is important to note that human perception of sound can be influenced by various factors, including the surrounding acoustic environment, personal expectations or biases, and the ability to distinguish between different types of noises. As a result, audiences often interpret sounds according to their own unique experiences and associations, which can lead to diverse interpretations of the same auditory event. In summary, without further contextual information or a more concrete description of the sound, it is impossible to conclusively determine its source or nature. However, based on the available details and considering the reaction of the person involved, it appears more likely that the sound came from a bodily function, such as a burp or a fart. Regardless of the exact cause, it is clear that the sound in question elicited a response from the individual and prompted them to apologize, adding to the mystery and intrigue of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) MILAN (AP) — The Latest the collapse of a bridge in Italy (all times local): 5:10 p.m. The mayor of the Italian city of Genoa says the death toll in the collapse of a highway bridge in the city has risen. Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci told Sky TG24 that the number of dead was now above 25 people and that 11 others who were injured have been pulled from the rubble. A huge section of the Morandi Bridge on a main highway linking Italy with France collapsed Tuesday in Genoa during a sudden, violent storm, sending vehicles plunging 45 meters (nearly 150 feet) into a heap of rubble below. Hundreds of rescue workers with sniffer dogs are searching through the tons of rubble and twisted metal looking for more victims. The bridge is on a key highway that connects Genoa to the eastern Liguria coastline and to France. ___ 4:45 p.m. It's too early to say what caused the deadly collapse of a highway bridge in the Italian city of Genoa, but corrosion or weather conditions could have been part of the cause, a structural engineer specializing in bridges says. \\"As this reinforced and prestressed concrete bridge has been there for 50 years it is possible that corrosion of tendons or reinforcement may be a contributory factor,\\" said Ian Firth, former president of The Institution of Structural Engineers. \\"The fact that there was reported to be a storm at the time may or may not be particularly relevant. In addition, ongoing work on the bridge may or may not be partly responsible for the collapse,\\" he added. Firth said the bridge is an unusual design but is similar to a larger bridge in Venezuela, and both were designed by Riccardo Morandi. ___ 3:45 p.m. The head of Italy's civil protection agency Angelo Borrelli has put the number of victims of the Genoa bridge collapse at 20 people dead and 13 injured. Borrelli told a press conference in Rome on Tuesday that the victims appear to all have been in vehicles that plunged from the bridge. Borrelli said that while there are two warehouses below the collapse it is believed they were closed for the summer holiday and that no one was inside. He said no residences were involved. Borelli said that highway engineers were checking the safety of the bridge in other points, and that some areas were being evacuated as a precaution. Earlier, Italy's deputy transport minister Edoardo Rixi said the number of victims had risen to at least 22 dead and eight injured. ___ 3:30 p.m. Italian Rixi told Sky TG24 that, as he was speaking, emergency response crews were recovering a body from an automobile that was suspended on a central part of the bridge. Rixi said it is \\"the biggest tragedy involving a bridge of this importance in Europe in the last decades.\\" He said that at least 20 vehicles on the bridge had plunged in the collapse, and that also people in buildings below the bridge were in some way involved. That included the trash management offices for the city of Genoa. ___ 3 p.m. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered Italy his country's help after a bridge collapsed in the Italian city of Genoa. The president's office said that Macron, who is currently staying at a presidential residence in southern France, had a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. In French and Italian, Macron wrote on Twitter: \\"Our thoughts go to the victims, their relatives and all the Italian people. France stands by Italy in that tragedy and is ready to provide all necessary support.\\" The disaster occurred on a major highway that connects Italy to France and other vacation resorts. ___ 2:20 p.m. The Italian news agency ANSA citing the Interior Ministry says that 11 people are confirmed dead in the collapse of a highway bridge in the port city of Genoa. ANSA reported Tuesday that five people are injured and in serious condition. The Interior Ministry press office could not immediately confirm the fatalities. An official with Italian firefighters, Amalia Tedeschi, told RAI state TV that some 20 vehicles, including cars and trucks, had been involved in the collapse. She confirmed that two people had been extracted alive from vehicles, with injuries. Tedeschi said that sniffer dogs are at work in the rubble looking for more injured and victims. In addition, heavy equipment was being moved in so they could lift pieces of the bridge. Tedeschi said the part of the bridge that collapsed was about 80 meters (yards) in length. Media reports had earlier put it at 200 meters. ___ 1:30 p.m. Italian news agency ANSA says one person has been extracted alive from the rubble of the bridge collapse near the northern city of Genoa and is being transported by helicopter to a hospital. ANSA says Italian rescue workers have identified at least 10 vehicles involved the bridge collapse. There was no immediate word on overall deaths or injuries. Maria Luisa Catalano of the highway police in Genoa said work was ongoing, adding, \\"we don't know numbers of victims/injured yet.\\" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said some 200 fire fighters are responding to the accident. On Twitter he says \\"we are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa.\\" The bridge is an important interchange between the northern regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and the beaches of Liguria, and to the main highway heading westward into France. ___ 12:55 p.m. Italian authorities say that about 10 vehicles were involved when a raised highway collapsed during a sudden and violent storm in the northern port city of Genoa. Private broadcaster Sky TG24 said that a 200-meter section of the Morandi Bridge collapsed Tuesday over an industrial zone, and firefighters told The Associated Press that there are concerns about gas lines. Police on Twitter said the collapse occurred during a sudden, violent storm, while firefighters said vehicles were involved, indicating the likelihood of fatalities. Photos published by the ANSA news agency on its website showed a huge gulf between two sections of the highway. Video captured the sound of a man screaming: \\"Oh god, oh, god.\\" Other images showed a green truck that had stopped just meters (yards) short of the gaping hole in the bridge. ___ 12:30 p.m. The Italian news agency ANSA says a raised highway has partially collapsed in the northern port city of Genoa. There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries. ANSA said that authorities suspected that a structural weakness caused the collapse on Tuesday. Images circulating on Italian media show the highway through the city with a large section missing. Emergency vehicles were responding. ||||| Rescuers in Italian city work through the night with sniffer dogs and heavy lifting equipment in scenes compared to an earthquake Italian rescuers have searched through the night for any survivors from the motorway bridge collapse in Genoa that has now been confirmed to have killed 35 people. “The latest official number is 35 but we can’t rule out it could rise further,” a Genoa police spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images In what witnesses described as an “apocalypse”, an 80-metre section of the Morandi bridge on the A10 motorway came down in an industrial area of the port city during a sudden and violent storm at about 11.30am on Tuesday. About 30 vehicles, including cars and trucks, were on the affected section when it fell 100 metres, mostly on to rail tracks, the fire service said. Investigators are now looking at what could have caused such a catastrophic collapse, creating a scene rescuers compared to the aftermath of an earthquake. Sniffer dogs searched through the rubble, and heavy equipment was moved in to lift pieces of the bridge. Heavy rain also made conditions more challenging. As cars and trucks tumbled off the bridge, truck driver Afifi Idriss just managed to come to a halt in time. “I saw the green lorry in front of me stop and then reverse so I stopped too, locked the truck and ran,” he told AFP.

The minister, from the Five Star Movement, was rebuked by the opposition for using “political propaganda” so soon after the tragedy. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, arrived in Genoa on Tuesday night and was expected to be joined later by his deputy, Luigi Di Maio. Conte said: “It’s too early to talk about the causes and hypothesis, but one thing is certain, a tragedy of this kind cannot be repeated.” The president, Sergio Mattarella, expressed his condolences in a statement, while stressing that Italians should be guaranteed the right “to modern and efficient infrastructure that accompanies everyday life”.

No authority can evade an exercise of full responsibility.” The Morandi bridge, which was inaugurated in 1967, is 90-metres high and just over 1km long. Restructuring work on the bridge was carried out in 2016. The highway operator said work to strengthen the road foundations of the bridge was being carried out at the time of the collapse, and the bridge was constantly monitored. Andrea Montefusco, an engineering expert at Luiss University in Rome, said: “It’s difficult to make any serious hypothesis right now. Some people are saying maybe lightning could have struck a cable on the bridge, but at this moment it’s too early to say anything about the cause.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescuers among the rubble.

Possible A: new jersey, new york, minnesota, eastern united states, connecticut Why is \\"connecticut\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Connecticut\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context for several reasons. First, let's analyze the question: \\"He took a toll road and ended up in a state he couldn't spell, it was probably which one?\\" In this question, the main clue is that the subject couldn't spell the name of the state they ended up in, suggesting that the state has a more complex or less intuitive spelling than others. Now let's consider the possible answers: 1. New Jersey - This state's name consists of two simple words and has a straightforward spelling. 2. New York - Like New Jersey, this state's name consists of two simple words and has an easy-to-spell name. 3. Minnesota - Although longer, the spelling of Minnesota is phonetic and generally simple for most English speakers. 4. Eastern United States - This is not a specific state, but rather a region, so it is not a suitable answer. 5. Connecticut - This state's name has a non-phonetic spelling and may be challenging for some people, especially those unfamiliar with it. The 'c' before the 't' in \\"Connecticut\\" may be easily overlooked, leading to misspellings. Among the possible answers, \\"Connecticut\\" has the most challenging spelling, making it the answer that aligns with human common sense. Additionally, since the question mentions the subject was on a toll road, it is worth noting that some highways in Connecticut, such as the Merritt Parkway, have tolls. This provides further support for Connecticut as the state in question. In conclusion, Connecticut is an answer aligned with human common sense as it has a less intuitive and more complex spelling than the other options provided, making it more likely that the subject of the question would have difficulty spelling it."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

But it's not just any old coin; the so-called \\"big maple leaf\\" Canadian coin is pure 24-carat gold, big and heavy, and valued at around 4 million, reports the BBC. Thieves carried away the 220-pound coin, which is more than 20 inches in diameter, sometime after 2am local time, reports CNN. It has a face value of 1 million, and while it would make investigators' job very easy if the crooks tried to spend it, police believe they will either melt the coin down or deliver it to a collector who hired them to steal it, the Globe and Mail reports. The Bode Museum in Berlin has housed the coin in its collection since 2010, reports the CBC. First issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 with an image of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and the country's symbolic maple leaf on the other, the coin made it into the Guinness Book of Records for its record-breaking gold purity of 99.999%. Authorities say the coin was secured behind bullet-proof glass in the building and that the bandits appear to have entered through a window, using a ladder that they left on nearby train tracks. The original coin is in Ottawa, while five others, including this one, were sold to private individuals.

Later that night, the businessman is killed by the elephant, which then destroys the camp. Quartermain then goes to London to rejoin his son, but is told by the boy's grandparents that they are filing for custody as they believe that Quartermain is an unfit father. Quartermain is told by his lawyer that they will probably win. He leaves and goes to the bar. While there, he is approached by Elizabeth Maitland and Captain Good to find her father. He refuses, not knowing who she is, and she leaves her father's card on the bar. On the way home, Captain Good stops to talk to an old friend and Elizabeth continues on.

When they get back to the hotel, they find her room has been ransacked. She reveals her father had sent her a map to King Solomon's Mines, and, despite Quartermain's scepticism about the map's authenticity, they leave for Africa. In Africa, they join Sir Henry, one of Quartermain's old friends, and, along with some of Quartermain's African friends, they set out to find Sam.

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Movie title: Superman Returns Movie plot: For five years, Superman (Brandon Routh) has abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey to visit the remains of Krypton. His seemingly selfish decision has ruined his image in the eyes of many, including journalist Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who writes a scathing article claiming that the world \\"doesn't need Superman\\". Billionaire Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who lost his fame and fortune after being exposed as a criminal by Superman, secures an early release from prison and marries an old heiress, whose subsequent death makes him wealthy once again. Upon returning to Metropolis, Superman, in his human identity of Clark Kent, is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance. While covering the launch of a space shuttle, he narrowly saves a plane carrying Lois and other observers from crashing after a mysterious power failure, an act that earns him much goodwill. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. Clark tries to fix his relationship with Lois, but soon learns that she is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Frank Langella), with whom she shares a young, asthmatic son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). Luthor has his aide Kitty (Parker Posey) distract Superman, allowing Lex to steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Suspecting his involvement, Lois requests an off-the-record interview aboard his private yacht. Luthor admits that he is indeed responsible and reveals his true plan: to create a new continent modeled after Krypton that he can shape in his image, while triggering massive tsunamis that will wipe out the nations of the world and force humanity to turn to him for survival. Jason has an asthmatic attack when Luthor reveals the kryptonite, but has no subsequent reaction when Luthor holds the stone near him. The Fortress of Solitude as depicted in the film.

You know how police officers and some other people carry things called 'guns' to help keep us safe? Some people have special permission to keep these guns hidden from view, which we call \\"concealed-weapons carry permits.\\" This is a permission slip that says, \\"I can carry my gun to protect myself or others if necessary.\\" Guess what? At the CU Campuses in Boulder and Colorado Springs, only a tiny number (less than 1%) of students have these special \\"concealed-weapons carry permits\\" to bring a hidden gun. This new rule talks about how these guns can and cannot be brought into different areas of the campus. There are special events called \\"athletic\\" and \\"cultural\\" ones that happen at the CU Campuses. Athletic events are things like basketball games, where students run around and have lots of fun. Cultural events could be plays or music performances, where students show off their talents. The new rule says that people aren't allowed to bring guns to these events even if they have concealed-weapons carry permits.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person who Chafe concluded their party had not reached the island?, using the article: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp.

Write an article with the title: \\"New Fafsa Rules to Eliminate Frustrating Financial Aid Problem\\" Article:","completion":"Title: New Fafsa Rules to Make Getting Money for School Easier Hello friends! Today, we are going to talk about something important for kids who want to go to college when they grow up. It's called Fafsa, which is short for \\"Free Application for Federal Student Aid\\". This is a special form that students fill out to get money to help pay for college. But sometimes, the form can be very confusing, and that makes people feel frustrated. So, new Fafsa rules are coming to make things easier and get rid of those problems! First, let's talk about why Fafsa is important. You see, college can be very expensive, and many students need some help to pay for it. When they fill out the Fafsa form, they can ask for money like grants and loans from the government and from their schools. The form looks at things like their family's money and how many people live in their home, then figures out how much help they need. But the problem is that sometimes, students and their families have troubles with the form. Maybe they don't know how to answer some questions, or they make a mistake when filling it out. Then, they might not get the right amount of money for college, and that can be very frustrating! That's why the people in charge of Fafsa are making new rules. Let's look at some changes that will help make things easier and get rid of those problems: 1. Easier to Understand: The Fafsa form will use simpler words and questions that are easy for everyone to understand. So, no more tricky questions that are difficult to answer! 2. Help from Your Phone: Students will be able to use a special app on their phones to fill out the form, which means they can do it from anywhere and get help right away if they're stuck. 3. Faster Answers: The Fafsa form will now connect with other government systems that already have information about students and their families. This means that they won't have to re-enter the same information over and over again – and they'll get answers about how much money they can get faster! 4. More Time: Sometimes, students need to make changes to their form because their situation changes, like if their family's money goes up or down. The new rules will give them more time to make these changes. So there you have it! The new Fafsa rules are all about making it easier for students to get the money they need for college. No more frustrating problems! We hope this helps our little friends who are dreaming about going to college one day. Just remember, even if college seems like a long way away, it's never too early to start thinking about your future and how Fafsa can help you get there!"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish. Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally. Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body? Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that the Red River had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body compared to the Black River. The clue here lies in the differences in fish populations and their ability to reproduce naturally. The fish in the Black River doubled their population in two years, suggesting that the conditions allowed for successful external fertilization and subsequently, a high survival rate for the eggs. This reproduction pattern is typical in most fish species, where eggs are laid and fertilized outside the mother's body. On the other hand, the fish in the Red River had a lower population and struggled to reproduce naturally. This could potentially be due to a lower rate of external egg-laying or less successful fertilization. It is also possible that the fish species in the Red River primarily reproduce through internal fertilization or that environmental factors negatively influenced the success of external fertilization. In conclusion, the Red River likely had fewer fish laying eggs outside of their body, resulting in lower reproduction rates and a smaller fish population compared to the Black River. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as environmental conditions and the specific fish species involved, to gain a clearer understanding of the differences in reproductive patterns observed between the two rivers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The prevalence of sexual harassment has taken center stage in the wake of recently reported harassment and assault allegations involving well-known celebrities, politicians, and media figures. Yet with shocking, headline-worthy stories emerging almost daily, sexual harassment should not be mistaken as a problem limited to elite circles. The actual data tell a different story about sexual harassment claims—in which they occur on a daily basis and across all industries. The vast majority of these claims occur out of the glare of the spotlight, where public scrutiny and attention is rare. Many women grapple with gender biases and power imbalances within their workplaces, making them targets for harassment or other forms of discrimination. Women of color, in particular, often must confront the combined impact of racial, ethnic, and gender prejudice that can result in degrading stereotypes about their sexual mores or availability and increase their risk of being harassed. Furthermore, women—particularly women of color—are more likely to work lower-wage jobs, where power imbalances are often more pronounced and where fears of reprisals or losing their jobs can deter victims from coming forward. This column analyzes new, unpublished data on sexual harassment charges in the private sector filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) over the past decade. The analysis shows the breadth of sexual harassment charges affecting both women and men in every industry and in every corner of the workforce. Specifically, the findings reveal: More than one-quarter of sexual harassment charges were filed in industries with large numbers of service-sector workers, including many low-wage jobs that are often occupied by women. Nearly three-quarters of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of retaliation either upon being filed or later on in an investigation, suggesting that many victims face retribution when they come forward. Understanding the pervasiveness of sexual harassment is critical in order to identify and deploy effective strategies to combat discriminatory practices—such as the use of gender-based stereotypes or the exclusion of women from high-level positions—that can enable harassment to take root. Understanding of the scope of the problem is essential in order to target enforcement resources where they are most needed and for maximum impact. Sexual harassment occurs across all industries Individuals alleging sexual harassment can file a charge with the EEOC—the federal agency responsible for enforcing critical employment discrimination laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most sexual harassment charges are filed under Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on factors such as sex, race, or national origin. Nearly one-third of the more than 90,000 charges filed with the EEOC in fiscal year 2016 involved a claim of some form of harassment—almost half of which involved sex-based harassment. The number of private-sector sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC each year offers useful insight into industry differences and from where claims arise. Based on an analysis of unpublished data from fiscal years 2005 through 2015, the EEOC received more than 85,000 charges alleging sexual harassment. Of these charges, nearly half—48.3 percent—include a designation indicating the specific industry in which the charges occurred. This industry-specific sample provides a representative snapshot of the differences in sexual harassment charges across industries over the 10-year period. (see Figure 1) The largest number of claims were found in the accommodation and food services industry, followed by retail trade, manufacturing, and health care industries. (see Figure 2) Accommodation and food services The accommodation and food services industry—including full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, coffee shops, recreational facilities, inns, hotels, and other hospitality establishments—accounted for 14.2 percent of the sexual harassment claims filed. Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that women represent the majority of workers in the accommodation and food services industry, often in lower-paying jobs such as food servers and preparers. The data on sexual harassment claims are bolstered by other research documenting long-standing concerns regarding its prevalence within this industry. For instance, a recent survey of fast-food workers found that two-thirds of female workers and more than half of male workers had experienced sexual harassment from restaurant management; nearly 80 percent of women and 70 percent of men reported sexual harassment from co-workers; and nearly 80 percent of women and 55 percent of men experienced some form of sexual harassment from customers. In addition, a Hart Research Associates survey found that 40 percent of women working in the fast-food industry had experienced some form of sexual harassment. Retail trade The retail trade industry, which accounted for 13.4 percent of the EEOC’s sexual harassment claims, includes businesses that engage in a variety of consumer sales such as department stores, grocery stores, florists, gas stations, drug stores, gift shops, office supply stores, and other retail establishments. Similar to in the food services industry, many of the jobs in retail trade—such as cashiers and sales clerks—are low-paying and occupied predominantly by women. Overall, more than one-quarter of sexual harassment claims arose in these two industries—both of which contain large numbers of service-sector jobs. Manufacturing In contrast to accommodations and food services and retail trade, women represent a much smaller percentage of the workforce in the manufacturing industry. Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that women represent just under 30 percent of workers in the manufacturing industry. Because many manufacturing jobs—such as machinists and craft workers—have long been male-dominated, women who enter the field may lack power or be seen as outsiders, thus making them targets for harassment. Health care and social assistance The health care and social assistance industry includes a range of jobs—from registered nurses to medical assistants to child care workers—many of which are predominantly occupied by women. Some of these jobs are also low-paying, which can add to the economic stress of workers who rely on their jobs to make ends meet. For instance, the overwhelming majority of home health aides are women—at 89 percent—and more than half are people of color. These workers, who typically provide in-home care for low wages, often work in individualized settings where they can become isolated and vulnerable to exploitation. Most charges are filed by women Over the EEOC’s 10-year time period, women reported the vast majority of sexual harassment charges at 80 percent—more than 68,000 charges. Clearly, women continue to confront much of the alleged harassment that occurs in the workplace. The data show, however, that men experience workplace sexual harassment as well. These data reinforce the need for both employers and employees to undertake comprehensive education and training in order to convey the pervasiveness of sexual harassment that occurs, regardless of gender. The majority of charges filed include allegations of retaliation Additional unpublished data on sexual harassment charges from fiscal years 2016 and 2017 reveal that allegations of sexual harassment are often coupled with allegations of retaliation. (see Table 1) For example, in FY 2016, approximately 72 percent of sexual harassment charges filed included a charge of retaliation. Similarly, in FY 2017, retaliation allegations were included in 71 percent of sexual harassment charges. These data suggest that sexual harassment complainants are often targeted for retribution or other adverse conduct, perhaps due to efforts at intimidation or to dissuade them from complaining. This suggests the need for greater attention to the implementation strategies of sexual harassment policies in the workplace as well as for stronger disciplinary or accountability measures specifically aimed at retaliatory conduct. Conclusion Sexual harassment is a persistent problem in the workplace and one that affects people across industries and at every level. To combat it, it is essential to have a clear understanding of where problems are most likely to occur as well as to undertake robust measures to target discriminatory practices. This includes creating a sound infrastructure to counter workplace sexual harassment, starting with enforcing strong leadership from the top; communicating clear policies; conducting comprehensive training with supervisors and staff; establishing an internal reporting mechanism that operates with integrity; and imposing strong disciplinary measures when appropriate. It also requires vigorous efforts to combat retaliation and improve enforcement through measures such as collecting more extensive data on trends across industries. Most importantly, it is crucial to devote special resources that root out harassment—especially in lower-wage occupations, where significant power imbalances can often inhibit workers’ ability to speak out against their harassers. Reducing the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in the workplace requires intentional and concrete action at every level and across every industry.

About 25,000 members of the Culinary Union voted Tuesday to authorize a citywide strike in Las Vegas unless they reach a contract deal with their employers by June 1, union spokeswoman Bethany Khan said. The contracts of 50,000 workers, including bartenders, guest room attendants, cocktail servers, porters and cooks at 34 casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown Las Vegas are set to expire May 31. The workers eligible for the strike are about half of the hospitality employee population in the city, Khan said. Workers are looking to protect their jobs, health care and benefits, according to Khan. Union officials are also negotiating for stronger contracts that will give workers greater protections when it comes to sexual harassment and immigration.

Q:You are presented with the question \\"Which gland has the largest impact on human metabolism?\\" and the following answer choices: - three - Pituitary - Energy - Chlorophyll - Sweat - energy usage - Salivary - Mammary Now knowing that thyroid hormones increase the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body and tSH, which is secreted by the pituitary gland, stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The best answer choice from the given options is the \\"Pituitary\\" gland. The pituitary gland plays a crucial role in regulating human metabolism by producing and secreting TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These thyroid hormones are responsible for increasing the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. It is important to recognize the relationship between the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland in this metabolic process. The pituitary gland acts as a central regulator that releases TSH to communicate with the thyroid gland and control the production of thyroid hormones. In situations where the level of thyroid hormones drops, the pituitary gland increases its secretion of TSH, which in turn prompts the thyroid gland to generate more hormones. This intricate feedback loop ensures that the body maintains proper metabolism levels, cellular energy production, and overall physiological balance. Although the thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) are directly involved in regulating metabolism, it is the pituitary gland that controls their production through the secretion of TSH. Therefore, the pituitary gland has the largest impact on human metabolism among the given answer choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It hasn't been an easy road for Lin. After high school, Lin sent his resume and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. After graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year. He has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list. Lin will likely get stronger the more minutes he plays, and even if Davis returns, spelling the older, recovering player could be productive for Lin: a proven good student who can learn a lot from practicing against a veteran. Without the services of All-Stars Carmelo and Amare, Lin led New York to a 4-0 record last week.

Garrigan becomes attracted to Sarah, who enjoys the attention, but refuses to engage in an extramarital affair.

Garrigan sincerely believes Amin will help the country, while Sarah warns him of presidents who have taken over before. Garrigan is called to a minor car accident involving Amin where he treats his hand.

Amin is impressed by his quick action and initiative. Amin, fond of Scotland as a symbol of resilience and admiring the Scottish people for their resistance to the English, is delighted to discover Garrigan's nationality and exchanges his military shirt for Garrigan's Scotland shirt.

Although the description \\"A lady setting up multicolored balls in a contraption\\" shares similarities with a lady building a ball pit, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a ball pit. A ball pit is typically an enclosed play area filled with multicolored balls, providing a fun and interactive environment for children to play in. It is important to keep in mind that multicolored balls can be used in various situations beyond a ball pit, and thus, not all scenarios involving multicolored balls equate to a ball pit. The term \\"contraption\\" refers to a device or machine that is intricate or complex and may serve a specific purpose. It is a vague description that does not provide enough information to identify the object specifically as a ball pit. The lady setting up the balls in a contraption could be working on an art installation, a mechanical system, a carnival game, or any number of applications with multicolored balls. Additionally, the phrase \\"setting up\\" suggests that the lady is in the process of assembling or positioning the multicolored balls. Although it is indeed possible that she is building a ball pit, there is not enough information provided in the description to draw a firm conclusion.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By any measure, the Mitt Romney for president campaign has had a painfully bad week. What went wrong? The bad news began Wednesday. That day, Romney addressed the NAACP convention in Houston. The speech was poorly received, so much so that Romney, in an interview that afternoon on Fox Business, told host Neil Cavuto that he had \\"expected\\" boos. Some interpreted that comment as proof that Romney had actually wanted to be booed by the NAACP in order to rev up elements of the conservative base.

Developed from a 1974 article published in the Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz , who also helped write the screenplay . - The Synanon organization, initially a drug rehabilitation program, was founded by Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Dederich, Sr., (19131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California, United States. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\" - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina. - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation. - Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvementeconomically, intellectually, or emotionallyoften with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Paul Morantz is an American attorney and investigative journalist.

Title: Giant Movie plot: Wealthy Texas rancher Jordan \\"Bick\\" Benedict, Jr. travels to Maryland to buy a horse. There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton, who ends a budding relationship with British diplomat Sir David Karfrey and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance. They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. Leslie discovers on a ride with Jett that the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition. When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs; War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata. Over the next ten years, Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan II (\\"Jordy\\") and Judy, and later have a daughter, Luz II.

Possible answers: [-] no [-] yes","completion":"Alright, let's first talk about the effects of the Cambodia earthquake and the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. The Cambodia earthquake happened in a country named Cambodia. It caused the ground to shake, and some buildings and houses got damaged. People got scared, and some may have got hurt. Now, let's talk about the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. The Lisbon earthquake happened in a city called Lisbon, which is in a country named Portugal. This earthquake was very big and caused a lot of buildings to fall down. Many people got hurt or lost their homes. There was also a big wave called a tsunami that came from the ocean and caused more damage. When we compare both the earthquakes, we see the Lisbon earthquake in 1755 was much more dangerous than the Cambodia earthquake. It caused more damage, and many more people got hurt. Now, let's talk about the Cambodia earthquake and the Concepcion earthquake in 1835. The Concepcion earthquake happened in a city called Concepcion, in a country named Chile. Just like the other earthquakes, the ground shook, and buildings and houses got damaged. Some people were hurt, and some may have lost their homes. When we compare both these earthquakes, we still see that they are different. The Cambodia earthquake happened in Cambodia, while the Concepcion earthquake happened in Chile. But both of them caused the ground to shake and some damage to buildings and houses. So, now let's see if the two questions are paraphrases of each other. The first question is comparing the Cambodia earthquake with the Lisbon earthquake in 1755, while the second question is comparing the Cambodia earthquake with the Concepcion earthquake in 1835. The answer is: [-] no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are comparing the Cambodia earthquake with two different earthquakes that happened in different places and at different times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ukraine was forced to shut down a reactor at its biggest nuclear power plant yesterday following an 'electrical malfunction', the second such incident in the space of a month.

Workers managed to repair to the fault and the reactor was reconnected to the power grid at 22:35, the plant's operator's NPP said in a statement. Shutdown: The Zaporozhiya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine where one of six reactors was automatically taken off-line yesterday following an electrical fault Earlier this month another of","completion":"the plant's reactors underwent a similar shutdown due to an electrical malfunction. While these incidents raise concerns over the safety and reliability of Ukraine's aging nuclear infrastructure, it is important to understand what led to these events and what measures are being taken to prevent future occurrences. The Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest in Europe and the fifth-largest in the world, with a total installed capacity of 5,700 MW. It is a critical component of Ukraine's power supply, contributing around 25% of the country's total electricity production. The facility includes six VVER-1000 reactors, all of which were commissioned between 1984 and 1995, making them more than 25 years old. In both recent cases, the reactors were automatically shut down by the plant's internal defense mechanism as a result of electrical malfunctions. These safety measures are designed to minimize the risk of accidents and ensure that the reactor remains under control even in the event of unexpected issues. The first reactor was shut down earlier this month, and after the fault was repaired, it was reconnected to the power grid. The second reactor experienced a similar issue yesterday morning and, after repairs, it was also reconnected to the grid later in the evening. While these incidents highlight the challenges of maintaining and operating aging nuclear infrastructure, it should be noted that the reactors' safety systems functioned as intended and prevented any further complications. The automatic shutdowns are part of a series of safety protocols in place to protect the plant, its workers, and surrounding areas from any potential harm. Ukraine's nuclear power sector is regulated by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI), which establishes and enforces safety standards and requirements based on international regulations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also monitors and evaluates the performance of nuclear plants worldwide, offering guidance and support to ensure that countries are adhering to the highest safety standards. Following these recent incidents, it is expected that both the SNRI and IAEA will conduct thorough investigations into the root causes and determine if any further corrective actions are necessary. To address concerns over the aging nuclear infrastructure, Ukraine has been investing in the modernization of its nuclear power plants through various projects aimed at extending their operational life and enhancing safety levels. These projects involve replacing outdated equipment, upgrading safety systems, and incorporating advanced technological solutions where necessary. Additionally, the country is exploring opportunities to diversify its energy mix through renewable sources like solar and wind energy to reduce the reliance on nuclear power. In conclusion, the recent electrical malfunctions at the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant have indeed raised concerns about the safety and reliability of Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure. However, the proper functioning of safety systems in these instances demonstrates the effectiveness of measures already in place. The attention and resources currently being dedicated to modernizing and upgrading the country's nuclear sector, as well as seeking alternative renewable energy sources, will be vital in reducing the risk of future incidents and maintaining a secure and sustainable energy supply for Ukraine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This bridge was not just a way for people to walk or drive from one side to the other. It was much more than that. It brought the people of both countries together, like two big groups of friends. This big, wonderful bridge was called \\"The Bridge.\\" It was very colorful, with lots of decorations and beautiful lights, just like a birthday cake. During the day, the sun would shine on the bridge, making it look like a giant, magical rainbow. At night, the lights lit up the bridge like a twinkling star, bringing a warm, fuzzy feeling to those who saw it. The people who lived in the town, near the border of the two countries, loved visiting the bridge. They would often walk across the bridge to visit their friends in the other country. It was like having one big neighborhood where everybody was friends with each other. At the center of the bridge, there was a special place called the \\"Friendship Circle.\\" It was a cozy little spot, with a few benches and a beautiful fountain. People would gather around the fountain, watching the water dance in the sunlight. They would share stories, laugh, and make new friends from both countries. Everyone knew the bridge was a symbol of peace, love, and friendship between the two countries. They knew that the bridge wasn't just a way to cross the border, but it was where they could celebrate their special bond. Sometimes, there would even be parties at the Friendship Circle. People would bring yummy food and refreshing drinks from both cultures, like tasty tacos from one side and delicious pasta from the other. They would play music and dance together, and just have lots of fun. For the children in the town, the bridge was a magical playground. They would run and skip along the bridge, pretending to be brave explorers on an epic quest.

The Women's March on Washington, D.C., is coming up later this month, the day after Donald J. Trump is inaugurated the 45th president of the United States. Here's a closer look at the Women's March, with answers to your questions about the event: What is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.? Women's rights groups and activist groups are coming together to stage a large demonstration in Washington, D.C., on the first full day of Trump's presidency. Most of the marchers are expected to be women, though men and children are also scheduled to be part of the event. The march began as a grassroots effort the day after the presidential election. A large number of women marching through the heart of Washington \\"will send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us,\\" organizers said. When is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.? The march will be held on Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. It is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. There will also be \\"Sister Marches\\" in nearly every state and several foreign countries. Why are women marching on Washington, D.C.? The march is not designed to be an anti-Trump rally, organizers said. But, the event -- first suggested by a grandmother in Hawaii -- is a response to many of the comments about women, minorities and other groups that made headlines during the presidential campaigns. \\"The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us -- women, immigrants of all statuses, those with diverse religious faiths, particularly Muslim, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native and Indigenous people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, the economically impoverished and survivors of sexual assault,\\" the organizers said. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem is a co-sponsor of the march. Other celebrities who have said they plan to attend include Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain. Where will the Women's March originate? The march will begin at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the U.S. Capitol. What's the route of the Women's March? Marchers are expected to walk along Independence Avenue toward the Washington Monument, though organizers said they do not plan to release the official route until a later date for security reasons. The permit issued by police in Washington, D.C., says march participants will disperse at the southern part of the Ellipse near the White House, at Constitution Avenue between 15th and 17th streets NW. An earlier plan to hold the rally at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial was nixed when march organizers failed to secure a permit from the National Park Service. How are people getting to Washington? Some participants are traveling to the march independently by car, train, airplane and the Washington, D.C., metro system. But, most of the marchers are expected to travel in buses coordinated by local organizing groups in each state. Updated information about transportation from each state is available via email, Facebook or state websites. How can you get more information? The Women's March on Washington website contains the latest news on the march, along with information about how to register for the event or donate to the cause. ||||| Janaye Ingram, center, with Ianta Summers and Ted Jackson at 3rd Street and Independence Avenue SW, where the march will begin. Ingram has been the local point person for getting the logistics issues smoothed out. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Teresa Shook never considered herself much of an activist, or someone particularly versed in feminist theory. But when the results of the presidential election became clear, the retired attorney in Hawaii turned to Facebook and asked: What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse? She asked her online friends how to create an event page, and then started one for the march she was hoping would happen. By the time she went to bed, 40 women responded that they were in. When she woke up, that number had exploded to 10,000. Now, more than 100,000 people have registered their plans to attend the Women’s March on Washington in what is expected to be the largest demonstration linked to Donald Trump’s inauguration and a focal point for activists on the left who have been energized in opposing his agenda. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) [Women’s March on Washington officially has a permit for Jan. 21] Planning for the Jan. 21 march got off to a rocky start. Controversy initially flared over the name of the march, and whether it was inclusive enough of minorities, particularly African Americans, who have felt excluded from many mainstream feminist movements. Organizers say plans are on track, after securing a permit from D.C. police to gather 200,000 people near the Capitol at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW on the morning after Inauguration Day. Exactly how big the march will be has yet to be determined, with organizers scrambling to pull together the rest of the necessary permits and raise the 1 million to 2 million necessary to pull off a march triggered by Shook’s Facebook venting. The march has become a catch-all for a host of liberal causes, from immigrant rights to police killings of African Americans. But at its heart is the demand for equal rights for women after an election that saw the defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first female presidential nominee of a major party. “We plan to make a bold and clear statement to this country on the national and local level that we will not be silent and we will not let anyone roll back the rights we have fought and struggled to get,” said Tamika Mallory, a veteran organizer and gun-control advocate who is one of the march’s main organizers. More than 150,000 women and men have responded on the march’s Facebook page that they plan on attending. At least 1,000 buses are headed to Washington for the march through Rally, a website that organizes buses to protests. Dozens of groups, including Planned Parenthood and the antiwar CodePink, have signed on as partners. Organizers insist the march is not anti-Trump, even as many of the groups that have latched on to it fiercely oppose his agenda. 1 of 55 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Here’s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

I’m not going to be silent anymore.’ ” [Military leaders say inauguration will be steeped in tradition] Trump Inaugural Committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn defended the president-elect’s popularity among women in an interview on CNN. While Trump did not receive the majority of women’s votes, he got an “overwhelming” number of them, Epshteyn said. “We’re here to hear their concerns,” he said. “We welcome them to our side as well.” That all this could grow out of a dashed-off post from her perch nearly 5,000 miles from Washington is amazing to Shook, who has booked her ticket and plans to be in the capital on Jan. 21. “I guess in my heart of hearts I wanted it to happen, but I didn’t really think it would’ve ever gone viral,” said Shook, who is in her 60s. “I don’t even know how to go viral.” Unsure of how to proceed in those initial few days, she said she enlisted the help of the first few women who messaged her to volunteer, some of whom independently also had an idea for a march. But as the march grew in prominence, it got caught up in a broader conversation in liberal circles about race and leadership, with activists and others criticizing that initial planning group for its racial makeup: Shook and all the women she tapped to help in the march’s nascent stages are white, she said. Some also took issue with the name Shook had proposed, the Million Woman March, which was the name of a 1997 gathering of hundreds of thousands of black women in Philadelphia. The racial concerns set off a heated conversation on the group’s main Facebook page, with some African American women especially taking umbrage. For her part, Shook said her aim was not to co-opt any other movement. It was just an idea that took hold after the victory of a president-elect caught on tape boasting of grabbing women’s private parts and the defeat of a woman who seemed to her much more qualified for the job. She said she had no idea of the race of the women she first contacted; in fact, she said, most had an image of Clinton as their Facebook profile photo. Complicating matters, it became apparent that the march probably could not start at the Lincoln Memorial as Shook had proposed, since the inaugural committee has dibs on that space. Overwhelmed and under pressure, the original organizers eventually handed the reins to a diverse group of veteran female activists from New York: Mallory, the gun-control activist; Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York; Carmen Perez, head of the Gathering for Justice, a criminal-justice-reform group; and Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur. Together, they settled on a new name: The Women’s March on Washington, a nod to the 1963 demonstration that was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement. They even received the blessing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest daughter, Bernice King. In the District, Janaye Ingram, the former executive director of Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, has been working to secure permits and hash out logistics for the march, including ensuring there is a proper sound equipment and sufficient portable toilets. People traveling to attend the march seem less concerned with behind-the-scenes politics than the chance to call for more family-friendly government policies, equal pay for women or reproductive rights. Some say they simply want to stand against the crass way Trump has spoken about women. Lindsey Shriver, a 27-year-old former pastry chef who is an at-home mom in Ohio, said she was offended this election cycle by Trump’s rhetoric, which she characterized as “hateful and misogynistic.” She also wants to highlight the need for paid family leave and affordable child care. “I realized that being a feminist in my own personal life wasn’t going to be enough for my daughters,” Shriver said. Caroline Rule, 57, a lawyer living in Manhattan, says she will attend with her 15-year-old daughter. While she agrees with the pro-women message behind the march, she said she would probably participate in any march that pushed against Trump’s messages. “I absolutely despise Donald Trump and everything he stands for,” she said. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem has recently signed on as a march co-sponsor, and celebrities including Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain say they plan to attend. Feminist scholars say the march reflects an emerging view of feminism: one that is less defined by reproductive issues, such as birth control and abortion, and more by how the challenges faced by women intersect with those encountered by African Americans, the LGBT community and immigrants. [None of the inauguration protests have their proper permits yet. Here’s why.] Still, reproductive rights will be a large part of the march, with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America as key partners. Hahrie Han, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara specializing in political organizations and political engagement, said it’s not all that surprising that individual women instead of an established organization founded this march. Established organizations all come with at least some political baggage. “The challenge with having one organization brand it as its own is that each organization has its own image that draws some people and pushes others back away,” she said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Women's March on Washington, D.C. is scheduled for January 21, 2017, and is expected to draw over 100,000 participants, including men and children.

They tell us that to make a big promise come true, £3 billion is needed. What promise? It is a promise made by a man named Mr. Miliband who wants people to be able to see their family doctor or GP in just two days. You might be wondering, what is a GP? Well, a GP or General Practitioner is a kind of doctor who helps your whole family with simple medical problems like a cold, a fever or a stomach ache. Mr. Miliband is a person who sometimes makes important decisions for our country and tells what can be done to make things better. He says that when people feel sick, they should have the right to see their family doctor really quickly, like in just two days! Did you know that a long time ago, the last Labour government - which is a group of people who make important decisions for our country - tried to do something similar? They made a target for doctors to see patients quickly, but it was not followed by the Coalition, which is a different group of people who make decisions. Sometimes, doctors are worried about having too many rules that can make their job even harder. So, they want Mr. Miliband and his friends to think very carefully before adding any new rules like this one. In conclusion, the Royal College of GPs says it will take a lot of money to make Mr. Miliband's promise about seeing family doctors in just two days come true. We all like to think that when we are sick, our doctor will be there to help us in no time.

Commercial flights will resume Saturday, the airport tweeted Friday evening. \\"We have not ruled out terrorism,\\" FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro said in an evening press conference. Law enforcement officials say the suspect, Esteban Santiago, was carrying military identification. He was apprehended and placed in federal custody. He is expected to face federal charges. Early Saturday morning, the Broward County Sheriff's Office posted his booking record, including booking photo, on its website. According to the record, he was booked on a murder charge. His \\"charge status\\" reads \\"Pending Trial,\\" and \\"Description\\" reads \\"Hold for US Marshals Office.\\" According to senior officials, the suspect flew from Anchorage, Alaska to Fort Lauderdale via Minneapolis. He boarded the plane in Alaska last night. He only checked one bag -- a hard case carrying his gun, Anchorage Airport Police told ABC News. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed. According to a Broward County commissioner, he allegedly loaded the gun in the bathroom and came out firing.

Mark Lea Diane Haggerty, a woman who said she works at a cruise line's kiosk at the airport, told ABC News she also heard what she thought was firecrackers but turned out to be gunfire. Haggerty said she saw a gunman \\"walking up and down shooting people\\" and dived behind the kiosk for safety. In addition to those injured initially amid the gunfire, 37 were injured after the incident, according to the Broward County Sheriff. Six trauma patients admitted after the shooting are in stable condition, according to the Broward Health Medical Center. Doctors would not give specifics on their injuries because of privacy laws. Multiple other patients were admitted due to minor injuries such as dehydration and heat-related issues, the doctors said. The FBI said they were not aware of any incident on board the flight or at the baggage claim. Friday evening, details were beginning to emerge about the suspect. NorthJersey.com Santiago, who spent nine years in the military, was a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left the military in August, said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions at the rank of Private First Class. He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. Along the way, he earned a number of awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal, according to his service record. A senior law enforcement official said that Santiago walked into the Anchorage FBI field office in November 2016, after his discharge from the military and said he was under mind control by a U.S. intelligence agency. The official said he appeared incoherent and agitated, saying the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos. However, he said he didn't want to hurt anyone. Still, the FBI contacted local law enforcement, which, out of caution, had him medically evaluated. The FBI closed the probe after reviewing databases and interviewing family the official said. Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 -- a company in Anchorage where Santiago worked in a security capacity -- said it has no comment and is \\"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\\" Authorities are \\"tearing apart\\" Santiago's service record to determine if he was suffering from PTSD, a senior law enforcement official briefed on the case told ABC News.

Officials said the suspect is in custody. (Thomas Johnson,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) A lone gunman who had just gotten off of a flight pulled a gun from his checked baggage and opened fire Friday at the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., international airport, killing five people and injuring eight others in a brief, bloody shooting rampage that terrorized. The attack at a quiet baggage claim area sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country’s busiest airports, shutting down all flights while paramedics and federal and local law enforcement officers flooded the scene. The suspected shooter is in federal custody, officials said Friday night. It appears he acted alone, said Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. In addition to the people slain, eight others were brought to area hospitals, all with apparent gunshot wounds, while dozens of others were injured in the chaos that followed the shooting. Police did not immediately identify a motive for the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which they said occurred just before 1 p.m., but said they had not eliminated the possibility of terrorism. “We are looking at all avenues,” George L. Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau’s Miami division, said at a briefing Friday night. “We have not ruled out terrorism and we will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack.” Piro also said that the shooter, identified as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, had voluntarily walked inside an FBI office in Anchorage late last year, and “his erratic behavior” caused concerns, so the agents who interviewed him had Santiago taken by local police to get a mental health evaluation. The gunman was taken into custody without any incident “almost immediately after the shootings,” Israel said during a news briefing Friday afternoon. “He’s unharmed,” Israel said. “No law enforcement fired any shots.” The man in custody was identified earlier Friday by several officials including Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who was told the name by the head of the Transportation Security Administration, according to Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the senator. A federal law enforcement official also confirmed the name to The Washington Post. Santiago was carrying an Army ID, according to three federal law enforcement officials. He was a passenger on a flight traveling with a checked gun in his baggage, said federal law enforcement officials, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. The officials said that Santiago had picked up his bag and took the gun into the bathroom to load it before returning to the baggage claim area to begin firing at people. John Schlicher, a pastor from Ohio who was in baggage claim when the shooting happened, said in a brief telephone interview that the gunman, who appeared to be wearing a blue “Star Wars” T-shirt, said nothing as he fired at people’s heads. “He was just shooting randomly into the crowd,” Schlicher said during an interview Friday afternoon broadcast on MSNBC. “There were two people to my left and two people to my right who were shot.” The gunman reloaded and continued firing at people, Schlicher said. When police arrived, Schlicher said his wife tried to administer first aid to a man who had been shot in the head while his mother-in-law tried using her sweater to help another man before realizing he was already dead. In a brief news conference Friday evening, trauma surgeons at Broward Health Medical Center, located just north of the airport, said they received five shooting victims and two needed surgery. All of the patients were in stable condition, they said. Hospital officials declined to comment on their specific injuries or release their ages and gender, citing privacy rules and the ongoing investigation. 1 of 38 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene at the Fort Lauderdale airport after a gunman opened fire View Photos Five people were killed in a shooting at the Florida airport, and several more were injured.

Travelers are allowed to bring firearms with them to flights, as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can generally be placed in checked baggage, but it is prohibited from carry-on luggage, and some airlines do not allow transport of any ammo. Passengers are also required to tell airline employees at the ticket counter that they have a weapon in their checked bag. Santiago is a U.S. citizen with ties to New Jersey, said two federal officials. Military officials said Friday that the suspected shooter, who they named as Esteban Santiago, was a combat engineer in the Alaska National Guard until August, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions after going absent without leave several times and being demoted in rank to private first class. He had previously served with the Puerto Rico National Guard, deploying to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011 and earning the Combat Action Badge for personally engaging enemy forces. In 2013, he was discharged from the Puerto Rico National Guard with the rank of specialist. According to federal law enforcement officials, his visit to an FBI office in Anchorage late last year prompted authorities to believe he may have mental health issues. Santiago went to the FBI office to report something and was expressing some incoherent thoughts, officials said. When he was interviewed by agents, he said he thought the federal government was after him and trying to control him, according to officials recounting the visit. Officials also said he told the FBI that the CIA was forcing him to watch Islamic State propaganda videos to control his mind. The FBI then contacted local authorities, who took Santiago to undergo a mental health evaluation, Piro said. After interviewing Santiago’s relatives and conducting other reviews and checking with other agencies, the bureau closed its assessment of Santiago. Though there had been some early reports that Santiago traveled to Florida from Canada, the Canadian Embassy in Washington said he had not been on a plane traveling from that country. Instead, they said he had flown from Alaska to Florida, with a stop in Minnesota. “The suspect did not fly from Canada and was not on a Canadian flight,” Christine Constantin, a spokeswoman for the embassy, said in a statement. “We understand from officials he was on a flight originating in Anchorage, transiting through Minneapolis and landing in Ft. Lauderdale. There is no Canadian connection.” Delta declined to comment on reports that Santiago had been on one of the airline’s flights, but did acknowledge it was working with investigators. At Anchorage’s Ted Stevens International Airport, Police Chief Jesse Davis said Santiago, who traveled alone, flew from Anchorage to Minneapolis and from there to Fort Lauderdale. He checked in for Delta flight 1088 four hours before flight, Davis said. “Everything appeared normal,” he said. “He didn’t call attention to himself at all. Our officers didn’t have any contact with him.” Davis stressed that it was common for someone to check a weapon in Anchorage. “It is not unusual to have passengers check weapons in and out of Anchorage. It’s a big hunting state, so we get it quite a lot of that.” Davis said authorities in Anchorage are reviewing airport security video footage in an attempt to track Santiago’s activities before the flight. Another flurry of nervous activity erupted at the airport later Friday afternoon when there were reports of additional gunfire, but Israel said there was no evidence of a second shooting. Police had said shortly before 3 p.m. that they were searching the airport following “unconfirmed reports” of additional gunfire, but Israel said there was “no second active shooter” and no additional victims. Panicked at airport pic.twitter.com/XeiCtAUoWO — julie k. brown (@jknipebrown) January 6, 2017 The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to the airport Friday, as did officials from Fort Lauderdale, the state Department of Law Enforcement and other agencies. Police and FBI agents were interviewing the suspected gunman Friday afternoon, according to law enforcement officials. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, no possible motive emerged for this latest spasm of gun violence in a crowded, public place. Piro, the FBI agent, said federal authorities were aiding local law enforcement “until we make a determination on the nature and motive of this.” A federal law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said that the gunman did not appear to say anything during his first interactions with police suggesting a political or terrorism-related motive, though the official said it is still early in the process. The shooting took place in the baggage claim at the airport’s Terminal 2, home to departures and arrivals for Delta and Air Canada, according to the airport. Footage from the scene inside the building captured the brutal aftermath of the shooting in the baggage area, which is on the airport’s lower level.

(The Washington Post) Jay Cohen was dropped off at the airport for a flight, and he arrived after the gunfire had already stopped, finding an unusual scene at the usually bustling facility. “The airport was like a ghost town,” Cohen, 51, a consultant, said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t see anyone around.” It wasn’t until he walked all the way up to the Delta counter without encountering a line or a single soul that he noticed about 20 people huddled together behind a nearby concrete wall. He peeked over the counter and saw the Delta employees on the ground trying to cover their heads with their hands. “Hurry up get behind here,” someone whispered to him. “Active shooter! Active shooter!” As he looked around the terminal he previously thought was abandoned, he now could see people hiding under benches, squished up against windows. Then Cohen saw police running full speed through the terminal, some with guns drawn, others with their hands on their holsters, while police cars began screaming up to the curb. “It went from eerie quiet from when I walked in to pure mayhem in just minutes,” he said. “It was chaos.” A hotline for information about Friends & Family at #FLL is available: 866-435-9355.

Julio Cesar, 48, had just arrived from a trip to Cuba with his wife and three children. The family had picked up their luggage when they heard screaming and airport officials escorted them to a waiting area secured by police. “In my 25 years in this country, this is the first time I’ve lived through anything like this,” Cesar, 48, a Miami resident, said in a telephone interview late Friday afternoon. “We’re still stuck in here, waiting to get out.” Passengers dragging suitcases continued to trickle down roadways near the airport through the afternoon. Mark Cobb said he was checking in for a United Airlines flight to Denver when he and his family heard screaming. “It was crazy,” he said. “The ticketing agents were screaming and cryin.” Many at the airport expressed frustration with the lack of information Friday. Hundreds were stranded on the tarmac and not allowed off the premises for hours as authorities sought to clear the airport, looking for other danger. Sophia Macris, 35, on her way to vacation in Florida, was still on her just arrived plane from New York when the shooting occurred. “They held our plane on the tarmac,” she said in an interview, still standing on the tarmac outside the terminal. “First, they told us there was fire alarm in terminal 2. Then they said emergency situation.” After the shooting, dozens of cars had pulled over onto the shoulder of nearby Interstate 595, as hundreds of people waited alongside the highway, family members and friends repeatedly trying to call loved ones who were scheduled to be on arriving flights. Saintnatus Adition was pacing along the highway, police cars racing past with sirens blaring. His 71-year-old father had just landed from Haiti when the chaos began. “He called and said it got very busy all of the sudden,” Adition said. He’s been frantically calling him to find out if he’s okay, but now he can’t reach him. “Of course I am very scared,” Adition said. “He is very old.” It was after 6 p.m. when Adition finally heard from his father. “I was so happy,” he said. “He told me he’s okay.” But his father was still in the airport at 7:30 p.m., waiting in a terminal, unsure when he would be able to leave. All flights were suspended following the shooting and the airport was closed, officials said. The airport had initially posted on Twitter about “an ongoing incident” at the baggage claims in one of the terminals, but did not provide further information. Shortly after 7 p.m., the airport said that passengers who had vehicles there were being allowed to leave, though they said the public was still not allowed inside. \\"We have the shooter in custody. He's unharmed. No law enforcement fired any shots,\\" the Broward County Sheriff said after at least five people were killed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. (Reuters) Officials at other major airports across the country, including those in Los Angeles and Chicago, said they were beefing up security in response to the shooting in Florida. President Obama was briefed on the situation at Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon and will be updated as new information is available, according to Ned Price, spokesman for the National Security Council. “This is a senseless act of evil,” said Florida Gov.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Associated Press) FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Latest on the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport (all times local): 3:35 p.m. A county official says the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter pulled a gun out of a checked bag, loaded in a bathroom and started shooting, killing five people and wounding at least eight. Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner, was briefed on the airport shooting by Broward Sheriff's office. He told The Associated Press by phone that the shooter was a passenger on a Canadian flight and had checked a gun. LaMarca says the shooter pulled out the gun in the bathroom after claiming his bag. Sheriff Scott Israel says the gunman was not harmed and that law enforcement did not fire any shots. He says it is not yet known if the shooting was an act of terror. Israel also says there was nothing to substantiate reports of a second shooting at the airport. ___ 3:15 p.m. A passenger says he heard the first gunshots as he picked up his luggage from a baggage claim carousel in a shooting at a Florida airport that left five dead and eight wounded. John Schilcher told Fox News the person next to him fell to the ground Friday. He says other people started falling, and he then dropped to the ground with his wife and mother-in-law. Schilcher says \\"the firing just went on and on.\\" He says the shooter emptied his weapon and reloaded during an eerily quiet lull in the gunfire. Schilcher says he didn't assume it was safe until he saw a police officer standing over him at the Fort Lauderdale international airport. He says he remained on the ground and was told not to move as authorities investigated unconfirmed reports of a second shooting. ___ 3 p.m. Officials say there have been unconfirmed reports of additional shots fired at the international airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a gunman killed five people and wounded eight there. On Friday afternoon, the Broward County sheriff's office said on its Twitter account: \\"Active search: Unconfirmed reports of addt'l shots fired on airport property.\\" Earlier in the afternoon, the shooting stopped all traffic at the airport. Passengers were evacuated from the terminal 2 baggage claim area. Passengers returned to the airport as officials said the lone gunman was in custody. But TV reports showed some passengers evacuating again, several looking panicked and ducking behind cars or hiding.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was a central figure in the development of rockabilly? ? Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \\"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label\\", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \\"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\\": \\"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\\". In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\\"At RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher, more intense manner. While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \\"Blue Moon\\" at Sun to the country ballad \\"How's the World Treating You?\\" on his second LP to the blues of \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.

GOP 2012 Hopeful Huntsman: We've Got to Cut Out the 'Cancer' of the Debt, Obama Has Failed to Lead This is a rush transcript from \\"On the Record,\\" July 28, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: First, he was pull of praise, calling President Obama \\"remarkable.\\" Now, he says the president is reckless. That is a switch. What happened? Candidate for president, former Utah governor, and former U.S. ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman. JON HUNTSMAN, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the Boehner plan is the only act in town and it is sound given any other alternative. It cuts and allows us to meet our obligations. And most importantly it begins to meet our budget. I think it would be terribly important for this country. And it also envisions looking at a competitive tax code longer term and that is terribly important for the overall competitiveness in the country. The Boehner plan gets us short term to be where we need to be and gets the issues queued up to begin discussing them seriously. Also, I have to say, Greta, that discussing the extent of the cuts and where we need to be during the 2012 election is a very important thing that the country should be doing. VAN SUSTEREN: The Boehner bill is a two-part process. Now, the spending cuts dollar for dollar and then down the road start looking at other expenses which is where the fight will be over entitlements. I think, a lot of the Tea Party think we need to start now and this is a Band-Aid, not a solution. HUNTSMAN: This is what people hate about Washington. The fact that something this important to our well-being and overall economic competitiveness [is] delayed until the 11th hour. The president has shown no leadership and doesn't have a plan on the table. My opponents in the race haven't even come up with what they support. VAN SUSTEREN: Governor Romney, you made a comment about him. HUNTSMAN: It's true. You've got to stand up. Time when leadership matters and stand up and voice where you are. We are kind of at the 11th hour. This is crunch time and this isn't academics or theory. This is the real world. We need to meet our obligations as 25 percent of the worlds I worlds if GDP and leading financial center in the world. That is important number one. Number two, getting cuts. We've got to get on with this cancer that has taken over this country. We need to cut it out and radiate it and excise it. This cancer has taken over the country and we need to do something about it. And the Boehner at least begins that process of cutting that I think is terribly important. And these larger issues that we all need to get serious about, competitive tax code and budget reform. Get them in the queue so they can be discussed during the election year. That is to our advantage. VAN SUSTEREN: You talk about the president's leadership and may have tweeted at one time [that] talking about the debt ceiling referred to I think the with word \\"reckless.\\" How do you reconcile, in 2009, you wrote a letter to him saying he was remarkable. What happened did you lose faith in him? HUNTSMAN: He was starting his administration. I was raised to be a gracious person. I thought it was remarkable that he put a Republican in his administration. VAN SUSTEREN: They all do. HUNTSMAN: Not in a position U.S. ambassador to China. I thought this was remarkable. VAN SUSTEREN: President Clinton put in Cohen at secretary of defense. HUNTSMAN: He puts in a Republican. High hopes and high tax expectations. Sadly today we don't have the leadership. VAN SUSTEREN: It's a big extreme going from remarkable to reckless. HUNTSMAN: It is where we are in the economy. He failed to deliver on the most important issue of our time and that is the economy and the creation of jobs. We are flat-footed and in neutral. And we have more confidence in where it company is going. Nobody it putting capital expenditures in their business because they can't see around the bend and what healthcare reform and financial services reform is going to cost them. We need to get the regulatory monkey off our back and get on with things like energy independence. VAN SUSTEREN: When you were governor you had to deal with a balanced budget amendment in your state? HUNTSMAN: We not only had that but we had the most significant tax cut in the history of our state. VAN SUSTEREN: Would you like to see a balanced budget amendment on the federal level? HUNTSMAN: I think it is the most important thing we could do. I think having that safeguard and that standard at the federal level is a very, very important thing for this country. When you build a budget as governor you do so with the idea in mind you are presenting it to your legislature in balanced form and for this nation that would be a similarly wise thing to do. VAN SUSTEREN: That is not in the Boehner bill. That's going to be a separate stand alone. A lot of people are critical of the fact it is not in the Boehner bill and instead the Boehner bill has caps and people are cynical when it comes to caps because caps this Congress and then two Congress escaped down the road, what caps? HUNTSMAN: Everybody has the expectation we will move towards a balanced budget amendment. This is a no-brainer and must be done. People are fed up with where we are financially, 14.3 trillion in debt. This cancer has got to be cut out. And one of the most important and powerful tools getting us there is a balanced budget amendment. VAN SUSTEREN: Should we be worried about the August 2 deadline or is that politicians scaring us? And secondly, even with the Boehner will sounds like we will be downgraded anyway. So does that factor into your thinking. HUNTSMAN: The market is going to react as we do. The markets are going to react as they will. But listen, it is important to maintain our triple-a rating in this country. We have done so for almost 100 years. VAN SUSTEREN: But the very people who gave the triple rating to the toxic CDOs, and so it's peculiar that the AAA rating we are trying to keep are from the very people that kind of put it us in this mess. HUNTSMAN: I understand, but that is separate. We are talking about maintaining a AAA rating. We are one of the few states that maintained our tripping a rating. This affects every family in this country. We had to work hard to maintain our triple a status. VAN SUSTEREN: But we're making our AAA standing with an organization that frankly has failed us so poorly before that it is sort of hard for me to think that they are the ones that I should care about. I realize the whole world economy looks to them, but there is something wrong with this picture. HUNTSMAN: There is something wrong with this picture, but it is the way it works right now and it is what is going to give the seal of approval and stamp of approval on where we are financially and that has an impact o on the overall cost of capital. To the extent that affects every family in this country it becomes an issue. August 2 is a deadline and we need to take that deadline seriously.

The isotope decays: As a consequence of radioactive decay, the isotope undergoes a transformation. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During decay, atomic particles (including protons, neutrons, or electrons) can be ejected from the nucleus to help stabilize it. 6.

PUBLISHED:. 18:11 EST, 20 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:11 EST, 20 October 2012. Earning power: Bradley after winning the Tour de France. Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins is slashing his tax bill by using an offshore scheme branded ‘abusive’ and ‘artificial’ by the Treasury. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the seven-time Olympic medallist, hot favourite for 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax. The 32-year-old cycling hero who climbed to the top of his sport partly thanks to Lottery funding, earned an estimated £5 million this year. He has joined a complex tax-avoidance partnership, Twofold First Services, which takes advantage of farming tax reliefs. But the Treasury has taken action to close the loophole and the taxman last night pledged to ‘investigate and challenge’ any arrangements put in place before the change in the law. Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership Management, based in the Cayman Islands tax haven. But the firm believed to have set it up, York-based Tax Trade Advisors, is also linked to NT (‘No Tax’) Advisors, the firm criticised for similar schemes involving comedian Jimmy Carr and Coronation Street star Bill Roache. Roache is also a member of Twofold, along with Wiggins and 230 other rich investors. How much Wiggins invested is not clear, but his spokesman insisted it involved only a ‘small percentage’ of his income and the ‘vast majority’ of his earnings were taxed at the higher rate of 50 per cent. Sources say the cyclist paid more than £1 million in tax last year. Companies House records show Wiggins joined Twofold on March 13 this year. On the same day, the Treasury issued a strongly-worded press release referring to an ‘abusive’ tax avoidance scheme’ without naming it. Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said it had shut down a ‘contrived’ scheme being marketed at the time, and that it would challenge any others put together before March 13. ‘The scheme . . . used artificial transactions to generate tax relief from a property business that owns agricultural land,’ said the Treasury at the time. Involved: Actor Bill Roache, posing for a snap with his partner Emma Jesson. Taken for a ride? The seven-time Olympic medallist has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax. ‘Although the land itself and the. business owning it will exist, the transactions are not part of any. genuine agricultural business. They are generated only to create an. artificial loss that can be set off by users . . . to reduce their. tax bill.’ In a. Twofold-type scheme, an individual could end up paying no tax at all, by. investing around £100,000 yet claiming tax relief on £1 million. This is achieved as each £100,000 is supplemented by a £900,000 loan taken out by the partnership. That money, after being paid to the farmer, is swiftly repaid to the bank. The accountants find a way to artificially ‘write down’ the investment to become a loss on paper, even though there was no cash loss. The original £100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees, but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £1 million, which they set against their income. Tax haven: Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership Management, based in the Cayman Islands (pictured) Last night an HMRC spokesman, referring to the unnamed March 13 scheme, said: ‘HMRC reacted very quickly when this scheme was disclosed and Ministers announced a change to the legislation within days. 'This protected the Exchequer by shutting down a scheme that was being marketed at that time. HMRC will challenge any schemes of this type which were implemented before the announcement.’ A spokesman for Wiggins said: ‘The vast majority of Bradley’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate. The investment in Twofold Services involves only a small percentage of Bradley’s income. Bradley has paid, and will continue to pay, his fair share of tax.’ Roache and NT Advisors declined to comment. Tax Trade Advisors could not be reached for comment.

Kevin Patrick Smith was born on August 2, 1970 in Red Bank, New Jersey, the son of Grace (nee Schultz), a homemaker, and Donald E. Smith, a postal worker. He has an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Smith, Jr. He was raised in a Catholic household, in the nearby clamming town of Highlands. As a child, Smith's days were scheduled around Donald's late shifts at the post office. After the success of his first films, Smith lived in Los Angeles, though he disliked no longer being near his New Jersey friends. He dated actress Joey Lauren Adams, and declared his desire to marry her in Time magazine, but they began to grow apart after he spoke of staying in Los Angeles permanently and starting a life with her. When Smith's grandmother became ill, he returned to Red Bank and remained there, realizing that that was where he belonged. Smith and Adams' relationship was tested by their working together on Chasing Amy, the set of which saw a heated argument between the two. They broke up in June 1997. Smith is married to Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, whom he met while she was interviewing him for USA Today. They got married at Skywalker Ranch on April 25, 1999. He photographed her for a nude pictorial in Playboy that consisted of photographs by various celebrities. Their daughter, Harley Quinn Smith, was born June 26, 1999, and was named after the character from the Batman comics. They live in the Hollywood Hills, in a house Smith purchased from longtime friend Ben Affleck in 2003. Initially raised Catholic, Smith began to develop doubts about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to see Catholic Mass as \\"dry and lip-servicey.\\" Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith read extensively on Christianity, explored other religions, read the Biblical apocrypha, and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film Dogma, the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998, he stated on \\"Back to the Well\\", a feature on the Clerks II documentary, that now he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres. Nevertheless, Smith told the BBC in September 2014 that he firmly professes a belief in God. He said, \\"Proof of God is that I have a career.\\" Smith is an avid hockey fan and loyal New Jersey Devils fan. He is also a fan of the Edmonton Oilers.

Mark Ralston / AFP / Getty Images Arizona's SB1070 is now law but, gutted of the provisions that made it a national controversy, it is a remarkably toothless instrument for policing, despite the huff and guff of anti-illegal-immigration hardliners like Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County (which includes Phoenix), who did not postpone scheduled sweeps through Latino communities. Indeed, for all the hype of Arpaio's \\"Crime Suppression/Illegal Immigration Operation\\" on Thursday, the day the law went into effect, he and his deputies arrested only three undocumented people. By contrast, on Wednesday nearly 90 illegal immigrants were arrested in a two-part sweep in Virginia and Washington, D.C. What vaporized from Arizona's new immigration law were stipulations that law enforcement could require proof of immigration status from people they have stopped for questioning. The original version would have made it a state crime not to carry documentation; and it would have let police arrest undocumented immigrants if they were found seeking employment in a public space. If Arpaio were armed with all of that, the likelihood is that he would have detained a large number of people. In his 16 prior operations, nearly 1,000 suspected violators were arrested, 60% of whom were undocumented immigrants. This time, out of about 40 people the Sheriff's office apprehended Thursday, only a handful  just 7%  were illegal immigrants. (See pictures of immigration detention in Arizona.) But there may have been other reasons the numbers were low, apart from the temporary injunction blocking the most contentious parts of the law. Some officers said the desert monsoon weather dampened the operation. Another factor may well have been Lydia Guzman, a prominent Hispanic activist, who, along with a group called CopWatch, designed a detailed messaging system to warn the Phoenix Valley of immigration sweeps. Guzman sent an initial text blast to 100 rapid response teams of business owners, Spanish radio stations, pastors and teachers, each of whom messaged their respective networks. At the same time, Guzman contacted lawyers, social workers and elected officials to be at the ready to help. \\"It spiderwebs out,\\" she says. \\"Before you know it my text tree spreads out to thousands of people.\\" (Is the \\"dangerous border\\" actually one of America's safest places?) Sheriff Arpaio has called her out for undermining his work. \\"The Sheriff has even accused me of putting coyotes [the popular name for operators of people smuggling rings] on text tree,\\" she told TIME. \\"But number one, they don't live here and, number two, a lot of smugglers are the ones we want put away. They are the ones who hurt our people.\\" (See pictures of the Great Wall of America.) In addition to Guzman's tweets, CopWatch visibly tails police operations. On Thursday, in one small West Phoenix mobile command center, members of CopWatch monitored police communications. \\"They just said '294 King'  that means immigration.

Write a summary based on this article: AFP Copyright: AFP The claim of the lorry attack in Berlin by so-called Islamic State (IS) does not prove much in terms of the attack. The group often refers to individuals who carry out attacks as its \\"soldiers\\" but the crucial question is firstly whether the individual had any form of direct contact with IS. Face-to-face or online communication are possible but far from certain. If there was no direct contact, it could still be the case that an individual was inspired rather than directed by the group. In this case, an individual may leave his or her own pledge of allegiance in written form or online or in a video. But until such evidence emerges, it remains hard to know if this is just an opportunistic claim by the group rather than one based on real substance. ||||| Firefighters attend an injured person after a truck ran into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. Police said that several people have been killed. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Associated Press) Firefighters attend an injured person after a truck ran into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. Police said that several people have been killed. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Associated Press) BERLIN (AP) — Police said Tuesday that the driver who rammed a truck into a crowded Christmas market in the heart of the German capital, killing at least 12 people and injuring nearly 50, did so intentionally and that they are investigating a suspected \\"terror attack.\\" The truck struck the popular Christmas market filled with tourists and locals outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near Berlin's Zoo station late Monday. \\"Our investigators are working on the assumption that the truck was intentionally driven into the crowd at the Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz,\\" Berlin police said on Twitter. \\"All police measures concerning the suspected terror attack at Breitscheidplatz are being taken with great speed and the necessary care,\\" they said. Numerous German media reported that the suspect, who was picked up about 2 kilometers (1½ miles) from the crash site, was a Pakistani citizen. Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack. Berlin's public radio station RBB-Inforadio cited security sources saying the man entered Germany on Dec. 31, 2015. News agency dpa, also citing unnamed security sources, said he came to Germany as a refugee in February 2016. Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes. Police declined to comment on the reports, referring questions to federal prosecutors who said they would hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a large-scale search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport overnight. Four men in the late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press. Among the dead was a man in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \\"They must have done something to my driver,\\" he told TVN24. In the immediate aftermath of the attack German officials were cautious in characterizing what had happened. \\"I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although a lot speaks for it,\\" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told ARD television late Monday. \\"There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.\\" Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday's attack, blaming German Chancellor Angela Merkel for what had happened. \\"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\\" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote. Manfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative party and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political grouping, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country. \\"The state must be able to check every refugee who comes here,\\" he told German public broadcaster ARD. French Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux expressed his sympathy after the attack. \\"We are all Berliners today,\\" he told Europe-1 radio Tuesday. \\"In this type of situation, we need unity to face down terrorists, and on this occasion we need European unity. It must be strong, particularly strong.\\" The White House condemned \\"what appears to have been a terrorist attack.\\" It came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \\"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events\\" in Europe. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump Islamic extremists must be \\"eradicated from the face of the earth\\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \\"freedom-loving partners.\\" Berlin's mayor, Michael Mueller, planned to hold a news conference on the attack at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT). The archbishop of Berlin, Heiner Koch, said he would hold prayers for the victims at the St. Hedwig Cathedral at noon. ___ Associated Press writers David Rising and Geir Moulson in Berlin and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in Berlin, after a driver ploughed a lorry through a crowded Christmas market in the centre of Berlin. At least 12 people died in the alleged attack, while almost 50 others sustained injuries. The driver fled the scene, but police say they have arrested a suspect they believe was at the wheel. The passenger in the vehicle died at the scene. The incident was reminiscent of an attack in Nice, France, when a lorry driver drove through a crowded outdoor celebration for Bastille Day on 14 July. Isis later claimed responsibility for the attack, calling the truck driver a “soldier”. Follow the latest updates here But the motivation behind Monday’s deadly episode remains unclear. Still, the President-elect was quick to blame Isis and radical Islamist groups – before investigators could issue any confirmation.

He confirms he will attend the vigil for the victims at 6pm in the memorial church on the square where the attack took place.

Berlin (CNN) German authorities released a man and intensified their manhunt for the person who plowed a tractor-trailer truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market , even as ISIS claimed Tuesday that it inspired the attack. Police said they didn't have enough evidence to hold a man they'd earlier described as a suspect in the Monday night truck assault that left 12 people dead and 48 injured. The dead include a man found shot inside the truck. There may be more than one suspect at large, armed and dangerous, Peter Frank, general prosecutor at Germany's Federal Court of Justice, told journalists. The ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency released a statement saying Monday night's attack was carried out by \\"a soldier of the Islamic State\\" in response to calls by the group's leadership to target citizens of international coalition countries. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said ISIS often uses this terminology to refer to attacks by alleged sympathizers in the West. \\"This should not be taken to mean the group is claiming it directed this attack,\\" Cruickshank said. \\"Investigators have not uncovered any links to ISIS.\\" German authorities are investigating the attack as an act of terror. Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists that we must \\"assume this is a terrorist attack.\\" Latest developments Prosecutor: Forensic tests haven't confirmed man was in truck's cabin. Mourners pack nearby church at memorial for victims. Officials say several people could have been involved in the attack. A weapon used in the attack has not yet been found. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site where 12 people died. Attacker at large? Berlin police called on the public to remain alert as confusion swirled over who was driving when the truck barreled over a curb into the crowded market. \\"They're really back to square one in terms of this investigation. ... It may well be a scenario of a manhunt, a race against time to arrest this individual before they can strike again,\\" Cruickshank said. German authorities released the man they'd detained after the attack. \\"The results of the investigation thus far have not produced imminent suspicion against the accused,\\" the general prosecutor said in a statement. Investigators had initially described the asylum seeker they detained as a suspect. But a day later, they seemed to be backing off that claim. \\"We possibly need to assume that we have not arrested the right one,\\" Frank said. \\"We do not know if there was one perpetrator or several perpetrators yet. We do not know if there was support given to the perpetrator.\\" Authorities didn't release the identity of the man they detained. De Maiziere said earlier that the man was \\"probably from Pakistan.\\" He entered Germany on December 31, 2015, Interior Minister Thomas De Maiziere said, and his application for asylum had stalled. So far, forensic tests haven't linked the man to the truck's cabin, the prosecutor said. Berlin police turned to the public for help and tweeted that they'd received 508 leads. Police also asked citizens to upload any digital video and photos of the incident or possible suspects.

The sounds of a choir singing rang out as a terrorism expert spoke to CNN near the market. \\"You have peace concerts, you have people laying down wreaths, you have people writing cards and people speaking silent prayers. This is completely unprecedented,\\" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization. \\"I don't think a lot of people are aware there's an attacker on the loose, potentially.\\" Those unable to enter the packed building waited outside in the winter air, many hugging each other, crying, or silently clutching candles. Polish citizen found dead Police identified the man found shot to death inside the truck as the original driver from Poland, reported German state media ARD. He was not driving when the truck came through the market, police said. The gun has not been recovered, De Maiziere said. The truck, which was owned by a Polish company, \\"was steered deliberately into the crowd,\\" police said. It was carrying 25 tons of steel, according to Ariel Zurawski, the owner of the truck company. Zurawski told CNN affiliate TVN 24 the vehicle may have been hijacked.

Merkel visited the scene of the attack,saying earlier it would be \\"especially disgusting\\" if anyone in the attack had been given asylum. Dressed in black and making her first public comments about the incident late Tuesday morning, she called for unity in the country. \\"I know that it would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that a person (who) committed this act ... was given protection and asylum in Germany,\\" Merkel said. \\"This is a very difficult day. I, like millions of people in Germany, am horrified and deeply sad about what happened yesterday in Berlin.\\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give a statement the day after the Berlin attack. Monday's attack could cause further political upheaval for Merkel, who has come under criticism over her government's generous acceptance of refugees. Germany has taken in more than 890,000 asylum-seekers in the past year, a much higher number than other European nations. But a backlash has been growing, fueled in part by Islamist terror attacks in Germany and across the continent. World leaders, including US President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, expressed support for Merkel and the German people. 'It felt like slow motion' Before the attack on Monday evening it was a quintessential German Christmas scene at Breitscheidplatz: Trees strung with lights, vendors serving candied fruit and waffles, the smell of gluhwein -- German mulled wine -- wafting through the cold December air. Authorites inspect a truck that sped into a Christmas market in Berlin. American Shandana Durrani was at the market, at the foot of the Keiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, and had stopped to reply to a text message when the truck rammed into the crowd at around 8 pm. She was lucky to have stopped, she said, as the truck mounted the curb, mowing people and stalls down just 20 feet in front of her, sending everyone \\"running, scurrying, screaming.\\" \\"I heard some popping and thought maybe there was a guy with a gun,\\" she told CNN. \\"People just started running and dropping their gluhwein.\\" View of the truck that crashed into a Christmas market at Gedächtniskirche church in Berlin.

The style of attack and the target suggested Islamic extremism, he said. A vigil has been held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, right next to the scene of the attack.

He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees and tells Mrs. Fremont that the Egyptian feast that he is preparing has not been served for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Fremont wants the catering done in two weeks, and Fuad assures her that he will have enough time to procure the last of his needed ingredients. After Mrs. Fremont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has displayed a large gold statue of his \\"Egyptian goddess\\" Ishtar. Fuad is preparing a \\"blood feast\\" â a huge vat containing the dead women's body parts â that will ensure the goddess's resurrection.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process you described is known as weathering, which is the breakdown of rocks, soil, and minerals into smaller particles known as sediment. Weathering occurs through various physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that work together to disintegrate and decompose rocks and other geological materials. Physical weathering, also called mechanical weathering, involves the process of breaking down rocks and minerals through physical forces such as freezing and thawing, temperature fluctuations, pressure release, and abrasion. For instance, water can seep into the cracks in rocks, and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rock to break apart. Alternatively, rocks can also undergo mechanical weathering through temperature fluctuations, causing them to expand during the day when it's warm and contract at night when it's cold, eventually leading to the disintegration of the rock. Chemical weathering occurs when rocks and minerals are altered or dissolved due to the direct or indirect interaction with various chemical agents such as water, acids, or oxygen. In this process, the original rock minerals are either changed into new minerals or are dissolved completely, altering the composition of the rock. Examples of chemical weathering include the process of oxidation, which forms rust on rocks with high iron content, or carbonation, where acidic rainwater reacts with carbonates in rocks, causing them to break down. Lastly, biological weathering is the process by which living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, contribute to the breakdown of rocks and geological materials. For example, plant roots can penetrate the cracks in rocks, exerting pressure and causing the rock to break apart. Similarly, organisms like lichens, mosses, and fungi produce acidic substances that can dissolve minerals in the rocks, leading to their disintegration. In summary, the first step of the sediment transportation process you described is weathering, which involves the physical, chemical, and biological breakdown of rocks, soil, and minerals into smaller particles known as sediment. This process sets the stage for sediment pickup, transportation, and deposition by agents such as wind or water, which move the sediment to new locations and contribute to the continuous cycle of erosion and sedimentation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the information provided does not answer the question about who makes BlackBerry devices. BlackBerry is a brand of smartphones, tablets, and services originally designed and marketed by the Canadian company BlackBerry Limited, formerly known as Research In Motion (RIM). John Chen is the current Chairman and CEO of BlackBerry Limited. The brand's popularity surged during the early 2000s, known for its secure communication capabilities and QWERTY keyboards, making it a preferred choice for business professionals and government agencies. However, with the rise of competitors like Apple's iPhone and various Android devices, BlackBerry faced a decline in sales. In response to the decline, BlackBerry Limited decided to outsource the development and manufacturing of their smartphones. In 2016, they signed a licensing agreement with TCL Communication, a Chinese multinational electronics company. Under this agreement, TCL Communication manufactured BlackBerry-branded mobile devices, while BlackBerry Limited retained control of the software and security aspects. This partnership ended in February 2020, and BlackBerry Limited signed a new licensing agreement with the Texas-based company OnwardMobility to continue producing 5G BlackBerry smartphones.

In children, pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) are recommended in combination with a valved holding chamber (VHC) to overcome the problem of coordinating inhalation with actuation. However, the influence of age and body size on the systemic exposure of drugs to be administered via a pMDI with VHC is still not fully elucidated.

But I can use this background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis, which is directly about the Earth as a self-regulating system that tends to achieve a stable state (homeostasis). The example provided about the carbon dioxide levels further demonstrates the stable state concept intrinsic to the Gaia hypothesis. Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which primarily deals with the relationships between space and time, the effects of gravity, and the behavior of objects in motion, rather than a stable state in Earth's ecosystem. Given this analysis, it can be concluded that Paul, while studying the Gaia hypothesis, studied more about the concept of a stable state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was a direct descendant of Jesse de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th Century due to religious persecution. De Forest's father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association's Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school \\"open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color\\", and which educated primarily African-Americans. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had presented a paper on an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady \\"continuous wave\\" signals that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to have come up with a variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen's work. Using his \\"sparkless\\" arc transmitter, de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill's telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city. On July 18, 1907, de Forest made the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone -- race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie -- which were sent from the steam yacht Thelma to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox's Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island. De Forest also interested the U.S. Navy in his radiotelephone, which placed a rush order to have 26 arc sets installed for its Great White Fleet around-the-world voyage that began in late 1907. However, at the conclusion of the circumnavigation the sets were declared to be too unreliable to meet the Navy's needs and removed. The company set up a network of radiotelephone stations along the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, for coastal ship navigation. However, the installations proved unprofitable, and by 1911 the parent company and its subsidiaries were on the brink of bankruptcy. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he make anything else","completion":"Yes, Lee de Forest made numerous contributions to the field of telecommunications. One of his most famous inventions was the Audion (later named \\"triode\\") vacuum tube, which played a significant role in the development of electronic technology.

In the text, it is mentioned that Lee de Forest made \\"the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone.\\" This was a significant achievement, as it showcased the potential applications for radiotelephone technology in various fields, including maritime communication. Additionally, his \\"sparkless\\" arc transmitter enabled him to transmit audio across a lab room and make experimental transmissions of music, further contributing to advancements in amplitude-modulated (AM) audio transmissions.

Fact 2: Earthquake tremors and volcanic activity are frequent. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what causes tremors?\\" with the following options: - tectonic plates coliding - fissures of hot, acidic water - sensory neurons - energy of moving objects - Thyroid-stimulating hormone - storms - the sun - richter scale Answer:","completion":"Tremors, or the shaking that occurs during an earthquake, are primarily caused by tectonic plates colliding. This option is most consistent with the given facts, which include that tectonic plates being pushed together causes earthquakes (Fact 1) and that earthquake tremors and volcanic activity are frequent (Fact 2). Tectonic plates are vast, solid slabs of rock that make up the Earth's lithosphere, which is the rigid outer layer of our planet. These plates are in constant motion, interacting with one another at their boundaries due to the convective motion of the underlying asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is a partially molten layer of the Earth's mantle that allows tectonic plates to move around. There are three main types of interactions between tectonic plates: convergent boundaries, where plates move towards each other; divergent boundaries, where they move apart; and transform boundaries, where they slide horizontally past each other. Tremors predominantly occur at the first type of boundaries, known as convergent boundaries, where tectonic plates are being pushed together. These collisions lead to a buildup of stress and strain within the Earth's crust, which ultimately becomes too much for the rocks to withstand. When this happens, the energy is released in the form of seismic waves, resulting in an earthquake's characteristic shaking or trembling motion. This shaking can occur at varying intensities, depending on factors such as the earthquake's magnitude, depth, and the type of rocks and soil present in the affected region. In summary, tremors are mainly caused by the collision of tectonic plates at convergent boundaries. The other options listed - fissures of hot, acidic water; sensory neurons; energy of moving objects; Thyroid-stimulating hormone; storms; the sun; and the Richter scale - are not directly related to the causes of tremors and earthquakes. Some of these options may be associated with other natural phenomena or even with the measurement and study of earthquakes, but they do not contribute to the occurrence of tremors themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The club has been deemed a vital part of the city's sports culture and maintains a steady fan base locally. Being a member of the club, Ahmad Kadhim Assad assumes a significant role in its activities, although the exact nature of this role - such as a player, a coach, or other staff position - is not specified in the data. Secondly, Ahmad Kadhim Assad is also tied to Al-Zawra'a SC, a renowned football club situated in Baghdad, Iraq. Al-Zawra'a SC enjoys immense popularity due to its successful run in the Iraqi Premier League, the highest tier of Iraqi football. Ahmad Kadhim Assad, being associated with this club as well, suggests that he possesses noteworthy dexterity or professional aptitude relevant to football. However, without explicit details about his role in this club, it's challenging to categorize his specific involvement. Lastly, the data provides insight into the management structure of Al-Zawra'a SC. This club is managed by Basim Qasim. The role of a manager in a football club is critical as they shoulder the responsibility of team performance, player management, and strategy formation. Since Basim Qasim is highlighted as the manager, he likely plays an integral part in the successes and faults of the team. He must align the club's objectives with the resources at hand, making necessary decisions related to players, training, and match strategies to achieve the club's goals. Presumably, Basim Qasim would maintain a continuous interaction with all associated with the club, including Ahmad Kadhim Assad, indicative of their professional relationship. This outlined data, although brief, presents a multifaceted view of Ahmad Kadhim Assad's involvement in the football realm across two distinct clubs, along with his probable professional interaction with managers such as Basim Qasim. Perhaps, with more detailed information, a comprehensive analysis of his contribution to these clubs and their respective successes could be generated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste? The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have... A:","completion":"The part of the eye that is enlarged in animals that are not thought to have a good sense of taste is the pupils.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"?

Santorum endorsed Rubio on Wednesday. Santorum can't name any of Rubio's Senate accomplishments Rick Santorum had one job to do in his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. He failed. The former Pennsylvania senator, who dropped his presidential bid Wednesday, told co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski he is supporting Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign because the Florida senator is someone “who can work together with people.” But Santorum struggled to name one accomplishment Rubio has had in the Senate. Story Continued Below “He’s been in the Senate for four years,” Scarborough noted. “Can you name his top accomplishment in the Senate — actually working in the Senate doing something that tilted your decision to Marco Rubio?” “If you look at being in the minority in the United States Senate in a year when nothing got — four years where nothing got done, I guess it’s hard to say there are accomplishments,” Santorum said. “I mean, tell me what happened during that four years that was an accomplishment for anybody? It was complete gridlock.” Scarborough shot back that Republicans have been in the majority for the past two years and asked what Rubio has accomplished there since being part of the majority. “Joe, look, the Republicans have been in the majority for one year and one month, of which, as you know, he was running for president primarily,” Santorum said. “The first four years he was in the minority, and nothing got done. And by the way, what happened this year under the Republicans?” Scarborough insisted he wasn’t defending Congress or being difficult in his questioning. “I’m just asking you to name one accomplishment that Marco Rubio —” Scarborough said as Santorum tried to interrupt. “But list one accomplishment. Just one. Just one that Marco achieved. Maybe a bill that he wrote. Maybe a moment in a committee.” Brzezinski then jumped in to make it easier on Santorum, offering a fill-in-the-blank question. “Jeb Bush ran Florida. Donald Trump built a company,” she began. “Marco Rubio... — finish the sentence.” “OK, Marco Rubio was, No. 1, the speaker of the Florida House, which is not something that’s a minor deal,” Santorum answered. “I mean, he was elected by his colleagues to be the speaker of the House. No. 2, yeah, he spent four years in the United States Senate being frustrated like everybody else that nothing got done, and then you can’t point to him and say well nothing got done and therefore he has no accomplishments.” That argument is “bogus,” Santorum said, slamming the “feckless Congress.” “It’s actually not a bogus argument,” Scarborough said. “All I’m asking is a simple question. I’ll ask it one more time, and don’t attack me because we’ve been friends for a very long time.” “No, no, no, let me ask the question one more time,” Scarborough said as Santorum tried to interrupt. “List one accomplishment that Marco Rubio has achieved in four years in the United States Senate. It doesn’t even have to be a passed bill.” “Well, I know he included something that went after the insurance companies in the most recent omnibus. I know that he fought for that to stop bailing out insurance companies,” Santorum said. “That’s one thing that I’m familiar with that I just saw recently, but — and again, he was on the campaign trail and accomplished that. The bottom line is there isn’t a whole lot of accomplishments, Joe, and I just don’t think it’s a fair question.” Since the 2010 elections, when Scarborough appeared to back Rubio’s opponent, Charlie Crist, relations have been frosty. Rubio has refused to go on the show, and Scarborough frequently bashes Rubio on air. A source familiar with Thursday’s appearance said Santorum would have been dissuaded from appearing had upper-level campaign staff known about it. “He took a s---,” one Rubio insider said of Santorum’s appearance. Rubio defended Santorum later Thursday, emphasizing that the former Pennsylvania senator had endorsed him only a day ago. “Rick just signed onto the campaign, so obviously he's working with us and, you know, we'll have to continue to work on telling our story,” Rubio said on Fox News. “And obviously Rick’s going to be a big part of doing that. I'm proud of what I've done in public service.” Eliza Collins and Marc Caputo contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Rubio, under sharp criticism from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, downplayed Rick Santorum's inability to name a single legislative accomplishment of his \\"The reality of it is the American Dream is still alive. It is still healthy. We need a president who helps us get there and that guy is Marco Rubio,\\" Scott said Washington (CNN) Sen. Marco Rubio is defending his record in Congress after Rick Santorum, now a Rubio backer, struggled to name any legislative accomplishments by the Florida senator. Rubio, under sharp criticism from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, downplayed Santorum's inability to name a single legislative accomplishment of his. \\"Let's be fair to Rick. I mean, he has spent the past year and a half running for president and his campaign, and he just endorsed us last night,\\" Rubio told reporters in Manchester on Thursday. Rubio then vaguely said he had \\"real achievements,\\" and repeated his arguments that he's shown \\"better judgment\\" on national security issues than his rivals. Earlier Thursday, Santorum, who ended his presidential campaign earlier this week after fairing poorly in the Iowa caucuses, said \\"it's hard\\" to name a significant accomplishment that Rubio has had in the Senate. He did say that Rubio has \\"tremendous potential and gifts.\\" Read More ||||| Asked repeatedly to name a single one of Sen. Marco Rubio’s accomplishments while serving five years as a U.S. senator representing Florida, Rick Santorum – who just endorsed the GOP lawmaker after bowing out of the presidential race himself on Wednesday – struggled to come up with any during an appearance Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Santorum floundered right off the bat when asked to list Rubio’s “top accomplishment” while in office. “Well, I mean, I would just say that this is a guy who’s been able to, No. 1, win a tough election in Florida and pull people together from a variety of different spots. This is a guy that I think can work together with people,” he said. “That’s the thing I like about him the most.” Yet host Joe Scarborough didn’t ask which personal quality of Rubio’s Santorum liked the most. He asked for just one standout accomplishment – so he pressed the former Pennsylvania senator again: “So he can win, but he’s been in the Senate for four years. Can you name his top accomplishment in the Senate, actually working in the Senate doing something that tilted your decision to Marco Rubio?” RELATED: Republican field narrows as Iowa caucus knocks out candidates Santorum danced around the question for a second time, concluding that “I guess it’s hard to say there are accomplishments” when a junior senator is working in a government “where nothing gets done.” “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski called the exchange with Santorum “disturbing.” Meanwhile, Scarborough brought up the fact that Republicans have been in the Senate majority for the past two years, and asked for a third time: “Can you name one thing that he’s passed in the last two years?” eventually pleading with Santorum to “like one accomplishment – just one, just one – that Marco achieved.” Santorum then blamed President Obama for Rubio’s lack of accomplishments in the Senate, saying “he spent four years in the United States Senate being frustrated like everybody else that nothing got done, and then you can’t point to him and say nothing got done and therefore he has no accomplishments. The problem is we have a president who doesn’t work with people.” Eventually, however, Santorum did offer an example of a Rubio achievement, albeit a vague one. “Well, I know he included something that went after the insurance companies in the most recent omnibus. He fought for that, to stop bailing out insurance companies. That’s one thing I’m familiar that I just saw recently, ” he said. “But – and again, he was on the campaign trail and accomplished that. The bottom line is there isn’t a lot of accomplishments, Joe, and I just don’t think it’s a fair question to say.” A Rubio aide asked by NBC to comment on Santorum’s struggle to come up with an accomplishment simply offered a list of examples of legislation Rubio passed and signed into law in recent years, including VA accountability reform and Obamacare bailout. The aide had not yet seen the interview. In his endorsement Wednesday, Santorum called Rubio a “born leader” who represents ”the new generation” during an appearance on the Fox News program “On the Record With Greta Van Susteren.” The former senator decided to suspend his campaign just days after the Iowa Caucus – the third Republican to do so this week. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who joined “Morning Joe” later in the hour, used Santorum’s interview to his advantage, saying flatly, “Rubio hasn’t accomplished one thing in his career.” The presidential candidate then listed off some of his own accomplishments, adding, “and Rick Santorum can’t name one thing Marco Rubio’s done. I will tell you one thing Marco Rubio’s done – he’s made it very clear on the issue of pro-life – Marco Rubio is not for an exception for rape, incest or the life of a mother. Now, you know, I think that’s the kind of position that New Hampshire voters would be really concerned about.” Donald Trump’s campaign manager was eager to jump on Santorum’s interview as well, retweeting the “Morning Joe” video early Thursday morning. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"During an interview with MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on Thursday, Rick Santorum, who recently endorsed Marco Rubio, struggled to name an accomplishment of Rubio in the Senate.

Write an article based on this summary: A multi-million pound sat-nav project aims to stop lorries and other vehicles getting stuck in narrow lanes and under low-lying bridges on UK routes.","completion":"Title: Groundbreaking Sat-Nav Project Aims to End Issues with Lorries Stuck in Narrow Lanes and Low-Lying Bridges in the UK Introduction Every year, numerous incidents involving lorries and large vehicles getting stuck in narrow lanes or under low-lying bridges cause traffic issues, delays, and damage to infrastructure across the United Kingdom. Seeking a solution to this recurring problem, a multi-million pound sat-nav project has been launched, aiming to put an end to these scenarios by providing accurate, real-time information to drivers, enabling them to navigate more efficiently and safely. Step One: Understanding the Problem Before diving into the details of the project, it's essential to understand why lorries and other large vehicles frequently get stuck in narrow lanes and under low bridges. Factors such as drivers relying on outdated maps, inaccurate sat-nav systems, and lack of proper signage contribute to these incidents, leading to costly damages and frustrating traffic problems. Step Two: Introducing the Multi-Million Pound Sat-Nav Project To combat these issues, the multi-million pound sat-nav project focuses on developing an advanced, accurate, and up-to-date routing system specifically designed for lorries and other large vehicles. This system will take into account the size and weight of the vehicle, ensuring that the suggested route avoids any roads or bridges where the vehicle may encounter difficulties. Step Three: Incorporating Real-Time Information A crucial aspect of the project will involve the integration of real-time data, such as ongoing road works, traffic congestion, and recent infrastructure changes. This information will be collected through various sources, including connected vehicles, road sensors, and data from other drivers, allowing the sat-nav system to create an optimal route for the driver based on the vehicle's dimensions and current road conditions. Step Four: Ensuring Ease of Use and Accessibility Understanding that any solution is only useful if it's user-friendly, the project aims to create a sat-nav system that is easily accessible and straightforward to use. The interface will operate on a range of platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and in-vehicle systems, ensuring that it caters to the needs of a diverse range of users. Step Five: Monitoring and Updating the System As with any innovative project, ongoing monitoring and improvements will be vital to secure the success of the multi-million-pound sat-nav system. Regular updates to the software will assure that the latest data is always available to drivers, while constant evaluation of the system will ensure that any glitches or shortcomings are swiftly addressed. Conclusion The multi-million pound sat-nav project aims to revolutionize the lorry and large vehicle navigation experience, significantly reducing the number of incidents involving stuck vehicles in narrow lanes and under low-lying bridges. By providing drivers with accurate, real-time data and an easy-to-use platform, this cutting-edge technology promises a safer, more efficient, and less frustrating future for everyone on UK roads."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gifford was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Lola Mae (nee Hawkins) and Weldon Gifford, an oil driller. He graduated from Bakersfield High School. Following Gifford's death in 2015, his wife Kathie Lee Gifford said that her late husband grew up in a poverty-stricken home and that he and his family sometimes ate dog food. She said they lived in 29 places even before Gifford attended high school because his father could not find work during the Depression. After his playing days ended, Gifford became a broadcaster for CBS, covering football, golf and basketball. When Monday Night Football was launched in 1970, ABC had originally planned to have Gifford in their broadcast booth, but he still had a year remaining on his contract with CBS. He therefore recommended his friend Don Meredith, who was hired. The following year, Gifford replaced Keith Jackson as Monday Night Football's play-by-play announcer, and remained involved with the show for 27 of its next 28 years. His low-key delivery provided a perfect counterbalance to broadcast partners Meredith and Howard Cosell. In an era with only three television broadcast networks, the series became the longest-running prime-time sports program in television history, and developed into one of television's most valuable franchises. In 1986, Al Michaels took over play-by-play duties, and Gifford switched to a commentator role. However, Gifford did play-by-play for the next several years (Gifford was joined by Lynn Swann on color commentary in 1986 and by Dan Dierdorf for the rest of his run on Monday Night Football) whenever Michaels was covering post-season baseball games for the network. Following his affair with airline flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997, Gifford was replaced in the broadcast booth by Boomer Esiason in 1998. That season, he was reassigned to a nominal role for ABC's Monday night pregame show, but the program was cancelled after one season. Gifford was not offered a new role by the network. Gifford was also host of British TV network Channel 4's NFL coverage with British born former New England Patriots kicker John Smith in 1986, which included coverage of Super Bowl XXI. Gifford was also a reporter and commentator on other ABC sports programs, such as coverage of the Olympics (including the controversial men's basketball Gold Medal game between the United States and Soviet Union at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, which Gifford called alongside Bill Russell), skiing and golf. He announced Evel Knievel's jumps for ABC's Wide World of Sports in the 1970s, including when Knievel failed to clear 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in 1975. Gifford also guest hosted Good Morning America on occasion, including once when he met his future wife Kathie Lee. In 1977, Gifford won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality. He was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame In 1995 for his NFL television work. Monday Night Football paid tribute to Gifford on September 14, 2015, by having ESPN announcers Mike Tirico and Jon Gruden wear the gold jackets that Gifford helped make famous as a broadcaster.

Derbyshire officers down by 10 per cent and Warwickshire down by 8.2 per cent. In the year to 31 March 2012, the 43 police forces recruited 2,394 full-time officers. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Police Recruitment Declines in Derbyshire and Warwickshire, Raises Concerns for Public Safety Introduction Recent data analysis highlights a concerning trend of decreasing police recruitment in two major English counties – Derbyshire and Warwickshire. Between Derbyshire and Warwickshire police forces, recruiting numbers are down by 10% and 8.2%, respectively. This information sparks concerns regarding the adequacy of law enforcement in these areas and raises important questions about public safety and security. Step 1: Detailing the Police recruitment issue It is essential to provide the reader with specific information about the decline in police recruitment numbers. Presenting this information accurately and factually can help support the argument that this is an issue of concern for local communities. In the year ending on 31st March 2012, the 43 police forces across the UK recruited a total of 2,394 full-time officers. However, recruitment rates in Derbyshire and Warwickshire have seen a significant downturn, with the number of officers in Derbyshire decreasing by 10% and in Warwickshire declining by 8.2%. Step 2: Evaluating the impact In this section, we must discuss the potential consequences of the decrease in police recruitment. Consequences should focus on how this directly affects the community, including public safety, response times, crime rates, and overall security. A decline in law enforcement personnel can jeopardize public safety and lead to longer response times for emergency calls. Moreover, there could be an increase in crime rates and a decreased sense of security in Derbyshire and Warwickshire communities. Step 3: Local responses and efforts It is important to research and present any efforts made by local communities and authorities to address the declines in police recruitment in Derbyshire and Warwickshire. This will offer a comprehensive perspective on the issue and display potential solutions or strategies taken by police forces or local administrations to handle the issue. Step 4: Expert opinions and recommendations To showcase the urgency of this issue, citing expert opinions and recommendations will help to further emphasize the potential consequences and best practices. This could include officials from law enforcement, criminology experts, or public safety authorities. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, we must reiterate that decreasing police recruitment in Derbyshire and Warwickshire is a pressing issue that can negatively impact public safety and security. Collaborative efforts between local communities, authorities, and experts are necessary to address this issue and ensure that adequate law enforcement presence is maintained. The need to execute both short-term and long-term strategies to boost police recruitment must be a priority to protect the community's safety and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She drops another penny on a golf course and it doesn't roll anywhere. The golf course has (A) more resistance (B) less resistance Choose the answer between \\"golf course\\" and \\"parking lot\\".","completion":"The correct answer is \\"golf course\\". To elaborate on the answer, let's examine the factors that determine the rolling distance of the penny in both the parking lot and the golf course. 1. Surface roughness: A rough surface provides more resistance and friction, making it harder for objects to roll or slide. In this case, a parking lot is usually made of concrete or asphalt which is a relatively smooth surface. On the other hand, a golf course is covered by grass, which is rougher and creates more resistance. When the penny rolled on the golf course, the grass fibers provided more friction, leading to a significant reduction in the rolling distance. 2. Slope: A sloped surface can affect the rolling distance. If the penny were dropped on a sloped parking lot, it might roll farther due to the additional force of gravity. In contrast, a golf course often has a more leveled or even, undulating terrain, which may prevent the penny from rolling too far away or even stop it from rolling at all. 3. Presence of obstacles: The presence of obstacles can greatly affect the rolling distance. In a parking lot, there may be fewer obstacles compared to a golf course, which may have divots, bumps, or undulations in the terrain. These factors would obstruct the path of the penny on the golf course, causing it to stop rolling sooner than it would on the parking lot. To sum up, when comparing the parking lot and the golf course, the latter has more resistance due to the roughness of its surface, the potentially more leveled or uneven terrain, and the possible presence of more obstacles that hinder movement. This is why Santana's penny didn't roll anywhere on the golf course, while it rolled far away when dropped in the parking lot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals - Acid rain in fog at higher elevations can strip foliage off trees. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people are more environmentally responsible happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis of people becoming more environmentally responsible would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on reducing the damage caused by acid rain. If individuals and industries adopt eco-friendly practices and technologies, the resulting reduction in harmful emissions will affect the entire process of acid rain formation and its impact on ecosystems. Here is a detailed explanation of the potential changes that may occur in the process of acid rain formation and how they could lead to less damage: 1. Reduction of harmful emissions: Environmentally responsible people are more likely to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint and the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. This can be achieved by using cleaner energy sources like renewable energy, implementing energy-efficient technologies, and adhering to stricter environmental regulations. With fewer emissions of SO2 and NOx, the formation of acid rain will be significantly reduced. 2. Less aluminum leaching from soil: As the overall amount of acid rain decreases, its ability to leach aluminum from clay particles in the soil is also reduced. This means that there will be less aluminum flowing into streams and lakes, decreasing its toxic effects on aquatic life. 3. Preservation of soil minerals and nutrients: With less acid rain, there will be a reduced dissolution of minerals and nutrients in the soil. This helps in retaining the essential elements required for plant growth and conserving soil fertility. Consequently, plants will have better access to the nutrients they need, leading to optimal growth and reproduction. 4. Stabilization of soil and water pH: As acid rain decreases, there will be lesser impacts on the pH levels of both soil and water. This helps in maintaining a healthier environment for plants and animals, ensuring their growth and survival. Reduced acidification of water bodies also supports aquatic biodiversity by providing suitable conditions for various species to thrive. 5. Reduced damage at higher elevations: With people being more environmentally responsible, there would be less SO2 and NOx emissions. In turn, the amount of acid rain in fog at higher elevations will decrease, reducing the risks of foliage stripping off trees. Preserving tree canopies is crucial for supporting ecosystems, as they provide habitat and food sources for a diverse array of species. 6. Indirect effects: When people become more environmentally responsible, they are likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, such as tree planting, habitat preservation, and supporting policies aimed at reducing pollution.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio? is inside the article: Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of drug rehabilitation at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio. The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.\\" Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, \\"writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.\\" Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album.

Question: What did Richard Owen do for a living? Context: The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871). Answer:","completion":"Richard Owen was an anatomist and a leading naturalist in Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again.

Described as doting parents, Scarpelli ran the Madison Wellness Center and his wife worked as the receptionist. The business had recently closed, the Daily Mail reports, and the couple was reportedly in deep debt, facing multiple tax liens. Scarpelli was sued in federal court for failing to pay back a student loan and owed about 123,000 to the feds and 42,000 to the state in unpaid taxes since 2003, per the Mail. The couple’s children attended an elite high school, and both enrolled in private colleges. Last year Joseph praised his parents in a school speech, saying they “repeatedly told me that I could wake up one day and lose everyone I love, but no one will ever be able to take away my faith.” A crowd-funding page was set up to aid the children's education.

Background: The Colbert Report () is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. Context: The New Yorker wrote that \\"Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. The Colbert Report and the Daily Show [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture.\\" The show also coined another word, wikiality, that means \\"reality as decided on majority rule.\\" Viewers of the show also coined a word, freem, based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to \\"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything -- without any responsibility or action.\\" In response to the \\"Better Know a District\\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007. In 2008, East Carolina University associate professor Jason Bond named a species of trapdoor spider Aptostichus stephencolberti in honor of Stephen Colbert. The \\"Colbert Bump\\" is defined, connotatively by the Report, as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on The Colbert Report, they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to the American Political Science Association, contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show. Magazines such as GQ, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated have all had sales spikes when Colbert appeared on their covers. Viewers of The Colbert Report were on numerous occasions cited as being more knowledgeable about current events than traditional news viewers. In April 2007, a Pew Research Center report cited both Colbert and The Daily Show viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio. Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience on campaign finance. He was awarded a Peabody Award for the parody, which was described as an \\"innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision\\". The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article. Some of them include: 1. The Colbert Report not only satirized conservative political talk programs but also made significant observations about the American political system, particularly regarding the influence of money. 2. The show introduced the concept of \\"wikiality,\\" which means \\"reality as decided on majority rule.\\" 3. The term \\"freem,\\" meaning \\"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything -- without any responsibility or action,\\" was coined by the viewers of the show. 4. The \\"Colbert Bump\\" refers to an increase in popularity of a person or thing as a result of appearing on or being mentioned in The Colbert Report. 5.

Build a movie plot around this: What must Kulkov do by himself? guard the prisoners Answer:","completion":"Title: The Lone Warden Plot Summary: The Lone Warden follows the story of Alexei Kulkov, a war-hardened ex-special forces soldier turned private military contractor. When Kulkov is assigned to a new mission, he must protect and guard a group of high-profile prisoners in an isolated, abandoned facility amidst an ongoing civil war. As Kulkov fights to keep the prisoners safe and secure from varying hostile forces, he soon uncovers their darkest secrets and the unintended consequences of his actions. Act One: The Assignment The film begins with an introduction to Alexei Kulkov (45), a tired and battle-scarred ex-special forces soldier who now works for a private military company. His latest assignment has led him to an unnamed Eastern European country ravaged by civil war. As he arrives at the high-security headquarters of the private military organization, Kulkov is briefed on his new mission: to guard a group of high-profile prisoners who possess vital intelligence, and keep them from falling into the hands of the rival factions. With the high stakes explained, Kulkov is led to the abandoned facility where he will be stationed. Seeing the rundown structure overtaken by overgrowth, Kulkov can sense the challenges that lay ahead. He silently vows to complete his mission and protect the prisoners at all costs, longing for the day when he can finally retire from his dangerous career. Act Two: Preserving the Peace As Kulkov familiarizes himself with the facility, he begins to learn more about the prisoners he is tasked with guarding. Among them are Artyom Mironov (35), a brilliant political strategist suspected of war crimes; Yelena Petrova (30), a maverick hacker wanted by numerous governments; and Mikhail Ivanov (40), a powerful arms dealer with blood on his hands. At first, tensions rise as the prisoners clash with each other and test the limits of their captor. Kulkov remains firm and disciplined, keeping the volatile group in check and under his constant watch. Over time, he starts to sympathize with their individual plights and becomes increasingly conflicted about his role in their detainment. Meanwhile, the warring factions in the country begin to close in on the facility, growing increasingly desperate to obtain the prisoners for their own agendas. Kulkov must rely on his wit and combat skills to fend off attacks from all directions. He is constantly on edge, stretched beyond his limits, defending the camp and the valuable prisoners inside it. Act Three: At The Crossroads Following a series of relentless skirmishes, Kulkov uncovers a shocking conspiracy behind the prisoners' detainment. He learns that his private military employers have been orchestrating events behind the scenes to prolong the civil war—using the intelligence possessed by the prisoners to manipulate and destabilize the country for their own financial gain. Torn between duty and his struggle with the truth, Kulkov defies orders and makes the life-altering decision to set the prisoners free. However, as he works in secret to create an escape plan, the final battle approaches, with both rival factions converging on the abandoned facility. In the heat of the intense firefight, Kulkov leads the group to an underground tunnel, and they make their daring escape. As the facility burns around them, Kulkov shares a final, heartfelt farewell with the prisoners, reflecting on their newfound respect for each other and the sacrifices he has made. Epilogue: Redemption As Kulkov and the prisoners part ways, a renewed sense of purpose drives him to turn his back on his former employers and expose their corruption. He decides to use his skills for good, working anonymously behind the scenes to restore peace and stability to the war-torn region. The film ends with Kulkov vanishing into the shadows—a firm but unassuming guardian, no longer a lone warden, driven by a quest for redemption and determined to make his sacrifices mean something."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of these would most likely improve the air quality in large Texas cities? Choices: [-] Limiting the number of cars on the roads [-] Switching to wood stoves for home heating [-] Requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel [-] Maintaining filters in large buildings","completion":"I will compare each choice and analyze their potential effects on improving the air quality in large Texas cities step by step: 1. Limiting the number of cars on the roads: Limiting the number of cars on the roads would lead to a reduction in vehicle emissions, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. This, in turn, would decrease the levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, leading to improved air quality. 2. Switching to wood stoves for home heating: Wood stoves typically produce more smoke and emit more particulate matter than other heating options, such as natural gas or electric heating systems. Consequently, increasing the use of wood stoves could worsen air quality in large Texas cities. 3. Requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel: Diesel fuel generally contains more energy per gallon than gasoline, which allows diesel-powered vehicles to have better fuel economy. However, diesel engines emit higher levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides than gasoline engines. By requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel, air quality could worsen because of the increase in these harmful emissions. 4. Maintaining filters in large buildings: Properly maintained filters in large building HVAC systems can help remove dust, allergens, and other particles from the air, but their impact on the overall air quality outside the building is limited. The improvement in air quality due to maintaining filters would be mostly confined to the indoor environment. Based on this analysis, the choice of \\"Limiting the number of cars on the roads\\" would most likely improve the air quality in large Texas cities, as it directly addresses the reduction of vehicle emissions, which are significant contributors to poor air quality."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913? from the following article ? During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin? ? Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote \\"The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile.

The Times reported that although there was \\"something like a hostile reception\\" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season \\"was received with scarcely a sign of opposition\\". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as \\"knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down\\".

Given the question \\"How would you describe Kendall?\\", is \\"feeling passive\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"It is not entirely accurate to describe Kendall as \\"feeling passive\\" based solely on the information provided about their magic trick. First, let's dissect the details available and then consider a more appropriate description of Kendall. Kendall performed a magic trick around the world, which has left the audience puzzled and unable to figure out the secret behind the trick. This demonstrates a few potential characteristics of Kendall: 1. Skilled magician: To create a magic trick that baffles people around the world, Kendall must possess a high level of expertise in the field of magic. This indicates a commitment to mastering their craft and a strong understanding of illusion and deception techniques. 2. Creative and inventive: Developing a unique and complex magic trick suggests a creative and innovative mindset. Kendall must be capable of coming up with novel ideas and implementing them effectively. 3. Ambitious and adventurous: Taking the magic trick around the world reflects Kendall's ambition and willingness to showcase their talents on a global stage. This implies a certain level of confidence and determination in their abilities. 4. Mysterious and enigmatic: Since the trick has left people unable to figure it out, Kendall projects an air of mystery. They have likely cultivated this image intentionally to create intrigue and generate interest in their performances. In contrast, the term \\"feeling passive\\" doesn't seem relevant as a valid description of Kendall. Passivity generally refers to a lack of action, engagement, or interest. In this context, Kendall's actions are far from passive. They are actively engaging with audiences through their magic trick, stimulating curiosity and sparking wonder across the world. However, it's important to acknowledge that we don't have any information about Kendall's internal emotions or feelings.

Felicia had been experiencing a variety of issues, including gaps and cracks in her walls, doors, and windows, which were not only compromising the structural integrity of her home but also causing drafts, leading to increased energy consumption and higher utility bills.

Let's break down each sentence and analyze their individual parts. Sentence 1: \\"Sussex and Lancing Colleges are recorded as having played a football match in November 1860, the first by public schools in Brighton.\\" In this sentence, the focus is primarily on the fact that Sussex and Lancing Colleges played a football match in November 1860. The information about it being the first match played by public schools in Brighton serves as additional context. It highlights that this particular match was significant because it marked a historical moment for local schools. Sentence 2: \\"Sussex and Lancing Colleges, which played a football match in November 1860, are recorded as the first of public schools in Brighton.\\" This sentence, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on Sussex and Lancing Colleges being the first public schools in Brighton to have played a football match. The fact that the match took place in November 1860 is added as supplementary information. In this case, the primary focus is on the schools' pioneering role in the football scene among public schools in Brighton. In summary, both sentences convey the same core information – Sussex and Lancing Colleges played the first football match among public schools in Brighton in November 1860.

Browns opportunity a ‘blessing’ as Robert Griffin III seeks to move on from Redskins drama BEREA, Ohio — The deconstruction of what happened with Robert Griffin III and the Washington Redskins has continued, somewhat unabated, since Griffin’s unceremonious exit from D.C. earlier this offseason when the team released its once-prized quarterback. There is lingering fascination, to some, over what went so right for one glorious season and what went so wrong thereafter, not to mention all the accompanying melodrama involving owner Daniel Snyder and two coaching generations of Shanahans. But if Griffin still cares about how the story is retold and how the blame for the unraveling of his Redskins tenure is carved up, he isn’t saying so. He has landed in what has been a graveyard for NFL quarterbacking reputations. But that’s just fine with him, and Griffin said Wednesday all his energy is devoted these days to trying to capitalize on the chance the Cleveland Browns have given him to reassemble his professional career. [The ‘most dangerous man in football’ traded an NFL career for an internship] “I don’t get wounded by it because I know the truth,” Griffin said at a Browns minicamp. “At the end of the day, I’m blessed with a new opportunity to be here. So I can’t worry about what’s going on back there. I don’t worry about it. I don’t see what comes out. I don’t read the articles. So that’s not my focus. My focus is being a Cleveland Brown, changing the culture here and giving this city something to be proud of. And I can’t do that if I’m focused on the past. So I’m moving forward, been moved forward, focusing on this team.” The Browns signed Griffin after the Redskins released the former NFL offensive rookie of the year. It was a once-unthinkable conclusion to Griffin’s stay in Washington, but one that became increasingly inevitable when his brilliant rookie season was followed by three years of injuries and disappointing play. Now he is attempting to become the Browns’ 25th different starter at quarterback since 1999. “It’s just a blessing,” Griffin said. “Some guys love free agency. Some guys don’t. I hated free agency. I didn’t know where I was gonna be. It was an uncomfortable feeling not knowing if you’re gonna get a chance to play football again. So when the Browns came calling and everyone else did and I had that decision to make, it was a blessing to be able to come here. And you just have to make the most of your opportunity. “There’s a calming feeling about when you know what you’re doing and how to get it done. And having the four years of experience in the league through all the ups and downs gives me that sense of calmness, that sense of peace, to know all I have to do is go out there and play the game that I love.” The Browns have not promised their starting job for 2016 to Griffin, but they have plenty invested in him recapturing his glorious past. Johnny Manziel is long gone. Veteran Josh McCown remains but does not seem like the answer for a rebuilding team. The Browns traded down from the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL draft and did not select a quarterback until the third round, when they chose USC’s unheralded Cody Kessler. [The Browns appear all-in on Robert Griffin III for 2016] It is up to Hue Jackson, the Browns’ first-year head coach, to try to get something positive out of Griffin the way he formerly helped Andy Dalton while serving as the offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. “I think Robert can do whatever we ask him to do,” Jackson said Wednesday. “I think he’s demonstrating that every day. I think he’s getting better at some things. … But I don’t have any reservations of anything in our offense that he can’t do. … He’s done well.” It will be up to Jackson to see if Griffin still can summon any of the improvisational magic he had as a Redskins’ rookie. Jackson’s aid will also involve developing Griffin into a reliable pocket passer, a transition Griffin failed to make in Washington while playing for two head coaches, first Mike Shanahan and then Jay Gruden. “Coach said something extremely powerful today,” Griffin said. “He said, ‘This is our offense. It’s not Hue’s offense. It’s not Robert’s offense. It’s not [offensive tackle] Joe Thomas’s offense. It’s our offense and you have to play within that system.’ And I think that’s the beauty of it whether he asks me to play from the pocket, play on the perimeter, run the ball, hand the ball off, whatever it is. Throw it 40 times [or] throw it 20 times — play within the system and then use your God-given ability when the system breaks down to make everything right. And I think that’s been the focus: Play within the system. When it’s not there, make something happen or throw it away.” Other Browns players said Wednesday that Griffin has made a favorable impression so far. “He’s very vocal,” center Cameron Erving said. “He’s very competitive. … He’s always been a confident guy. But he’s definitely getting more comfortable.” Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams said that Griffin has struck him as a hard worker and a coachable player. “I like him,” Williams said. “He has all the tools to be a really good quarterback for us.” Griffin said he has not gone out of his way to try to convince his new teammates what they might have heard about him from his polarizing days in Washington is inaccurate. “I’m not actively trying to do that,” Griffin said. “I think when you hear rumors, whatever, guys are gonna make their own judgment on you by what they see. And the worst thing you can do is try to come in and be somebody that you’re not. … What we say is guys’ BS meters can go off really fast. If you’re BS’ing them, they’ll know you’re BS’ing them. So I haven’t actively tried to do that. … But a lot of the stuff can be extremely false and you can come in and prove to them who you really are. “That’s what the blessing of a new opportunity with a new team, a new organization, has blessed me with a chance to just go out, be myself and let guys make their own determination about who I am.” Griffin spoke Wednesday of devoting more practice-field attention to sliding at the end of a run or throwing away the football while in the pocket to avoid a sack or a hit. Those are things mentioned often by Shanahan early in Griffin’s Redskins career as skills needed by the young quarterback to better safeguard himself as his career progressed. Griffin now is so intent on demonstrating his willingness to throw the ball away when warranted that he sailed a pass or two over the fence surrounding the Browns’ practice fields this week. “Every practice, you have to practice like it’s a game,” Griffin said. “And I think those are two of the things that I didn’t practice enough. I didn’t practice throwing the ball away enough. I didn’t practice sliding enough. So that’s why I slid last week. And that’s why you see me breaking windows out there on the field” by throwing the ball away. Even if he maintains that he no longer pays attention to what is said about his time in Washington, Griffin acknowledges that the lessons of his Redskins tenure could serve him well going forward. “In a short amount of time, about four years, I’ve been through a lot of things in the NFL that guys don’t experience in their entire time,” Griffin said. “So I just try to draw upon those experiences and go out, have fun, play the game, master the process, trust the process and the results will come.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text discuss Robert Griffin III's transition from the Washington Redskins to the Cleveland Browns, his intentions of focusing on the present and giving the city of Cleveland something to be proud of, and how he plans to utilize the lessons learned during his time with the Redskins to improve his performance and decision-making on the field.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Question: \\"Why is the FDA concerned about the e-cigarettes?\\" Answer: \\"Brands\\" Is this answer to the question correct? OPT: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"A). No, the answer to the question \\"Why is the FDA concerned about the e-cigarettes?\\" is not \\"Brands\\". The FDA's concern, as detailed in the text, is primarily about the health and safety risks that the devices pose due to the presence of nicotine and other dangerous chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic, in the cartridges of e-cigarettes. Also, the FDA has concerns about how these products are marketed to the public. The challenge is heightened because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, so the agency lacks comprehensive knowledge on the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of chemicals that the various brands deliver to their users."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Fact 1: Aplant requires food for survival.

A short lived japanese TV-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. A group of guys have captured a young woman.

They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in \\"loving\\" closeup, push a needle through her eye.

The Golden State Warriors were aiming for the best win-loss record in NBA history. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had a 13-game winning streak and were on pace to put up the best point differential the league has ever seen. Monday’s game was hyped as a must-watch event: the Warriors’ unstoppable offense against the Spurs’ impossible defense. Well, the Warriors promptly solved that impossible defense, and basketball fans were treated to yet another Warriors blowout. Golden State demolished San Antonio 120-90. There was very little the Spurs could do. Putting Kawhi Leonard, the reigning defensive player of the year, on Steph Curry only briefly slowed him down. Curry scored 37 points in the game, despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter. Even for those who have enjoyed watching the Warriors embarrass opposing teams, Monday’s game was a disappointment. There was no drama, no suspense, no intrigue. Fans were promised a historic clash. Instead, they witnessed the basketball version of the NFC championship game between the Panthers and the Cardinals. (Curry was playing playing the role of Cam Newton, obviously.) Now, this was only one game, and it may end up being just an aberration. The Spurs were playing at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have yet to lose all season, and without Tim Duncan, who sat out with knee soreness. Although his days as a MVP candidate are firmly in the past, Duncan’s presence would have made a difference, albeit probably not a 30- point one. The two teams next play on 19 March, in San Antonio, with the Spurs potentially at full strength. If the Spurs pull off victory there, or even suffer a close loss, we’ll all go back daydreaming about a seven-game Western Conference finals between the two. But maybe that is wishful thinking. It’s also possible that these Warriors have no rival and will continue to decimate the NBA like an invasive species without a natural predator. This was the second time in two weeks that the Warriors embarrassed one of the teams that supposedly had a shot at knocking them out of the playoffs. Last week, they took on the Cavaliers in what was supposed to be an NBA finals preview. That turned out to be a 34-point road win for the Warriors. That loss spurred a coaching change and questions about whether Cleveland’s LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-Kevin Love super-team was doomed by the Warriors’ mere existence. It’s to the point where the NBA might have a Superman problem on its hands. As many attempted movie adaptations will attest, it’s notoriously difficult to develop engaging stories about Superman, a character so powerful he can do just about anything. It’s difficult to come up with believable scenarios for Superman where there’s any drama or provide him with opponents that represent any realistic danger. Greatness, no matter how impressive, can end up being boring without legitimate conflict. We’re not at that point with the Warriors yet, but Monday night’s win suggests that this rest of this season could end up completely lacking suspense – unless a team figures out what their Kryptonite could be. Not sure what sport this is but it looks amazing pic.twitter.com/xCqoGR1CI7 The Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks couldn’t duplicate this series of ridiculous offensive mistakes if they spent weeks practicing choreography. It’s almost annoying when Kent Bazemore finally makes a shot. I’m not sure if “carried” is right term for this, but the events of the last week certainly have revealed exactly how much weight LeBron James holds within the organization. It’s widely believed that James was instrumental in his team’s decision to replace head coach David Blatt with assistant Tyronn Lue on Friday. Publicly, James had said he was surprised by Blatt’s firing, and maybe he didn’t directly request the change, but nobody believes the team would have make such a drastic move if James were against it. Judging by the reports that followed the announcement, the only real surprise that James could have is in the fact that Blatt lasted as long as he did. If David Blatt’s getting fired, how in the hell do the rest of us have jobs? Because our front offices aren’t quite as crazy as theirs. – Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy on Blatt’s firing. The Notorious SVG has a point. Under Blatt, the Cavaliers had a 30-11 record and was comfortably at the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Most franchises wouldn’t make a change under these circumstances, but most franchises aren’t run by Dan Gilbert. Of course, Van Gundy, of all people, should realize that basketball teams have no shame when it comes to firing head coaches to placate a superstar player. 1. Golden State Warriors (Last week: 1) It’s not entirely the case that the Warriors don’t have a true rival, it’s just that the team they’re playing against hasn’t existed for nearly 20 years. With their Monday night win, the Warriors improved their record to 41-4, tying the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for the best start in NBA history. At this point of the season, 72-10 seems like a very possible goal. 2. San Antonio Spurs (2) Before Monday’s loss to the Warriors, there was an argument that the Spurs were actually the best team in the NBA despite their less impressive record. Now? Now it would be easier to defend BoB’s claim that the earth is flat. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (4) The Thunder had a seven-game win streak going until they lost a blizzard-delayed game against the Nets on Sunday. Maybe the Nets should only play on snow days from here on out. Another ripple effect from the Blatt firing? LeBron James is now almost as hated in Israel, where Blatt coached Maccabi Tel Aviv, as he was in Ohio after The Decision. 5. Los Angeles Clippers (5) First, the Clippers steal the Pistons’ move of letting Josh Smith go for nothing. Then comes the news that Blake Griffin will miss significant amount of time after injuring his hand in an “undisclosed team-related incident.” Later rumors emerge that this incident was a fistfight with a member of the equipment staff that began in a restaurant. Other than all that, things have been quiet on the Clipper front. Congratulations Toronto, you’re currently in the weird, nebulous position that is “second best in the Eastern Conference.” Don’t get comfortable: some other team will take your place within the week, if not days. Also, congratulations to Kyle Lowry for rightfully getting voted in as an All-Star Game starter. That’s a much less tenuous achievement. Normally, when a team goes through a coaching change, a team is motivated to make sure their next game is a big win. The Bulls would have none of it, solidly beating the Cavaliers on their home floor in the first game of the post-Blatt era, causing their own fans to turn against them. Remember last year, when nearly the entire Hawks’ starting lineup went to the All-Star Game? This year, there’s a good chance Paul Millsap will be their lone representative when the reserves are announced on Thursday. Speaking of the All-Star Game, did you know that Zaza Pachulia was almost voted in as a starter? It’s true, thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Georgia, a Fugee and a Vine celebrity. Also: did you know that Vine celebrities can influence popular voting now and that this is absolutely terrifying on a wide variety of levels? Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace says he won’t be “compelled” to make a move before the trade deadline. Translation: he knows they have no shot of beating the Warriors, Spurs or the Thunder in the playoffs. The Rockets, breaking new ground in their mission to make basketball as painful to watch as possible, intentionally fouled Andre Drummond 21 times during a loss to the Detroit Pistons. “Hey, Mr Riley, this is Ray Allen’s lawyer. If you continue to call my client, we will have no other option but to take out that restraining order we’ve talked about.” The Spurs’ loss on Monday means that, improbably, the Pistons remain the last team to beat the Warriors. Anonymous, confidential message to Danny Ainge: “Give Avery Bradley anything and everything he wants, my heart cannot take him leaving. Sincerely, HF.” The Pacers lost to the Warriors by a mere 12 points last Friday, which clearly means they’re objectively a better team than both the Spurs and the Cavaliers. Kemba Walker won Eastern Conference player of the week honors and has a small but non-zero chance of making the All-Star Game. All of this is confusing. While the Warriors and Spurs were playing what was supposed to be the game of the century, the Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins was busy scoring 56 points against the Hornets. The Hornets still won. 18. New York Knicks (15) In a 97-84 loss to the Hornets, Jeremy Lin scored 26 points against his old team, which served as a reminder of the golden age of Linsanity, back when the Guardian had an entire tag devoted to him. The Wizards are currently under .500 and out of the playoff picture. Maybe it’s time for a coaching change. Is there anybody that just became available? The Magic lost their sixth straight game on Monday, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. 2016 has been particularly unkind to them. 21. Portland Trail Blazers (20)22. Utah Jazz (19)23.

In the offseason they signed Alfonso Soriano to a contract at 8 years for 136 million, and replaced manager Dusty Baker with fiery veteran manager Lou Piniella. After a rough start, which included a brawl between Michael Barrett and Carlos Zambrano, the Cubs overcame the Milwaukee Brewers, who had led the division for most of the season, with winning streaks in June and July, coupled with a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the Reds, and ultimately clinched the NL Central with a record of 85–77. The Cubs traded Barrett to the Padres, and later acquired Jason Kendall from Oakland. Kendall was highly successful with his management of the pitching rotation and helped at the plate as well. By September, Geovany Soto became the full-time starter behind the plate, replacing the veteran Kendall.

One of them was very tall with fair hair, the other was short and fat with a beard. The two young men waited for a few moments, and then ran quickly and quietly towards Mrs. Riley. The tall one held her from behind while the other one tried to seize her handbag. Suddenly Mrs. Riley threw the tall one over her shoulder. He crashed into the other one and they both landed on the ground. Without speaking, Mrs. Riley struck both of them on the head with her handbag and walked calmly away.

Mrs. Riley paused, turned round, smiled at them and walked into the South West London Judo Club. The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because_. A) they had nothing to do B) they were homeless C) they were waiting for a victim D) they were guarding the shop Answer:","completion":"C) they were waiting for a victim The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because they were waiting for a victim to target and attempt to rob. This is evident from their actions in the story, as they quickly and quietly approach Mrs. Riley with the intention of seizing her handbag. Their choice of a dark shop doorway as their hiding place suggests that they were trying to blend into the shadows and remain unnoticed until the opportune moment to strike. In the narrative, it initially seems that Mrs. Riley, an elderly woman, would be an easy target for the two men. However, they were in for a surprise when Mrs. Riley skillfully threw the tall one over her shoulder, causing him to crash into the other one and both ending up on the ground. Mrs. Riley's impressive actions imply that she had prior martial arts or self-defense training, which is confirmed when she walks into the South West London Judo Club after the incident. The situation described highlights the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the potential dangers that may arise. It also serves as an example of not underestimating a person based on their age or appearance, as Mrs. Riley was able to effectively protect herself and her belongings from the two young men. The story concludes with an interesting twist, leaving the would-be robbers sitting on the ground in disbelief, having been bested by an elderly woman. This turn of events not only demonstrates Mrs. Riley's physical prowess but also her fearlessness and composure amid a threatening situation. In summary, the two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because they were waiting for a victim to target and rob.

Washington region’s fabled traffic jams eased last year With the nation’s economy on the rise, traffic congestion picked up last year in all but one of the 10 most congested metropolitan regions: Washington. In fact, Washington was one percentage point less congested, according to Inrix, the global traffic-tracking company that uses transponders in 100 million vehicles to provide real-time traffic flow data used in traffic reports. Every other city that made the traffic top 10 saw congestion shoot up last year, including Los Angeles (8.5 percent), New York (5 percent), Boston (22 percent), San Francisco (13 percent). Although Washington can no longer take perverse pride at being No. 1 or even in the top five (it slumped to seventh by one yardstick and 10th by another), commuters who want to fume can take heart that they still waste 40 hours a year stuck in traffic. Much has been written about a shift in the region’s urban dynamic, with people who once fled the city or who grew up in suburbia moving to the District. The population is up, but the number of households that own a car and the number of licensed drivers are not. More people are using public transit, rental cars and bicycles to get around town. But that’s not unique to Washington, nor is it the primary reason that the region saw a decline in congestion. “That’s what happens when D.C. shuts down for a month and government hiring slows with sequester,” said Jim Bak of Inrix. Furloughs and the government shutdown last year put fewer drivers into the daily commute, he said. “If we didn’t have the shutdown, D.C. would have been flat or up slightly,” Bak said. “Blame it on Congress. That’s kind of a popular thing to do these days, isn’t it?” Washington wasn’t alone in seeing a drop in congestion. So did Youngstown, Akron and Toledo in Ohio, Scranton and Allentown in Pennsylvania, and several other cities. “When you look at the cities with drops, they were the Rust Belt cities that never got [their economy] going last year,” Bak said. In all, 61 metropolitan areas in the United States saw traffic increase last year. Several of those cities — Austin, San Jose, Seattle and Boston — saw a corresponding growth in population as people were attracted by job availability and the desire to live in an urban core. “People are moving where the jobs are, and that’s major urban cities,” Bak said. “Young people who are coming out of college want to live in urban centers, not in the suburbs.” As that trend toward renewed urbanization continues, he said, the United States may struggle with more congestion. While the average driver in Washington loses 40 hours a year stuck in traffic, he said there are those who waste “way, way more than that.” With 70 percent of the world’s population forecast to be clustered around urban hubs by mid-century, he said commutes like the two to three hours drivers invest in San Paolo, Brazil, and congestion like the infamous 10-day traffic tie-up caused by road construction in Beijing in 2010 should be lessons for the United States. “The solution for us isn’t going to be building new roads,” Bak said. “Our future highways are going to be built with software and technology.” Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Last year, traffic jams in the Washington region got a little better. While traffic got worse in many other big cities, Washington had one percent less traffic. One big reason for this is because the government closed for a month, and many people did not have to drive to work. People in Washington still spend 40 hours a year stuck in traffic, but it has improved compared to other cities. More people are also choosing to use public transportation, rental cars, and bicycles to move around the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Which fruits would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure, bowl A or bowl B?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Two university students studied different types of drugs for their exams. Kate studied statins, while Carol studied anti-depressants. Which student learned less about rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? The answer is:","completion":"Carol. The student who studied anti-depressants, Carol, learned less about the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis because her studies focused on anti-depressants, which are related to mood regulation and do not directly deal with cholesterol biosynthesis. On the other hand, Kate, who studied statins, learned about this enzyme because statins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, the subject of cholesterol biosynthesis and the role of HMG-CoA reductase in it would have been a major part of Kate's studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the fatalities included the car's driver. An off-duty policeman witnessed this devastating accident. Level crossings are areas where roads intersect with railway lines, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to cross the tracks. Accidents can occur at these points due to various reasons, such as signal malfunction, driver negligence, or failure to adhere to traffic rules and barriers. In this case, the text suggests that the train was moving at a high-speed when it collided with the car, causing the multiple fatalities. The off-duty policeman, who likely happened to be nearby during this incident, observed the horrifying scene unfold before him. The text explicitly does not provide any specifics about the cause of the accident or the identities of the victims. However, it does highlight the severity and tragic nature of the event. Such catastrophic accidents often spark conversations about safety measures at level crossings and the importance of proper maintenance and monitoring of railway infrastructure. Sometimes these events result in investigations into the cause of the accident and may lead to updates or improvements to existing railway safety systems.

Summarize this article: The atrocities committed by the terror group ISIS are so horrific that a high-profile al Qaeda member, an American citizen, purportedly addressed the group directly in a new al Qaeda publication and lectured them that if they keep it up, Allah will not grant them paradise in the afterlife. “My dear brothers: While no one can deny the considerable strength and prowess of the Islamic State group [ISIS] in military terms, at the same time, the crimes it has committed against Muslims cannot simply be overlooked or forgotten with time, because in Islam there is no statute of limitations,” the late Adam Gadahn said, according to an al Qaeda magazine published recently online. “And if these wrongs are not brought to an end and rectified here in this world, then a severe punishment has been promised both for those who committed them as well as those who encouraged, condoned or justified them, even if from behind a computer or mobile phone thousands of miles away.” “Oppression of any kind is wrong, and [there] will be darkness for its perpetrator on the Day of Judgment. The Ummah’s [Muslim community’s] Jihad is not a video game; it is real life, with real consequences, in this world and the next,” he said. Gadahn, born Adam Pearlman, was killed accidentally in an American counter-terrorism operation in January, according to the White House. Apparently the U.S. forces who conducted the mission didn’t know Gadahn was at the target location. Another al Qaeda member said in the magazine that it was an airstrike that killed Gadahn. The interview with Gadahn, in which he discusses his background as a California boy in an unorthodox home and his bizarre journey into the ranks of al Qaeda, appears to have been conducted last fall. A majority of the 80-plus page interview is dedicated to sharp criticism of ISIS, the terror group that split from al Qaeda in recent years and one that Gadahn says “is already known to be responsible for the murder and killing of a large number of Muslims on the flimsiest of pretexts.” “Does anyone think [Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda figures] were calling on them to bring the wrath of the entire world down on Iraq and Syria by attacking and displacing largely powerless and defenseless minorities and slaughtering their men and enslaving their women and children?... Of course not!” he said. “Frankly, all of us used to be sympathetic to varying degrees towards the Islamic State of Iraq [ISIS] -- despite its mistakes –- when it was seen as a weak and oppressed force valiantly fighting brutal tyrannies. But now that it has become clear that it has – unfortunately – adopted some of the traits, methods and tactics of those same tyrannies, it no longer holds the same place in our hearts that it did once upon a time.” AFP/Getty Images Early last week ISIS released its most gruesome video yet -– one showing the execution of a dozen fighters, some purportedly members of al Qaeda’s Syria faction. Different groups of the men are drowned, blown up by a rocket-propelled grenade or decapitated with explosives. Friday an ISIS affiliate claimed responsibility for the bombing of a mosque in Kuwait, which killed 27 Muslim worshippers. In addition to the mass killing of Muslims, Gadahn also took issue with ISIS’s on-camera murder of Alan Henning, a British humanitarian. Henning was one of a string of Western hostages, including three Americans, to be executed by ISIS. Gadahn claimed that al Qaeda went as far as demanding ISIS release Henning because he was an aid worker. “…[T]he brothers in An-Nusra [al Qaeda’s faction in Syria] sought the release of Henning soon after his kidnapping, but regrettably, their appeals – like the rest – fell on deaf ears,” Gadahn said. “Alan Henning didn’t go to Syria as a soldier or a spy. He went to Syria as a member of a Muslim aid convoy to distribute relief supplies to displaced and needy Syrians. But rather than thank him, some interlopers rewarded him first by kidnapping him and then by slaughtering him on camera.” But Gadahn's sympathetic words are out of place compared to other parts of the interview, where the American celebrated the attacks on Canadian soldiers and the Canadian Parliament, and later described his jubilant reaction to the 9/11 attacks in which his organization killed 3,000 innocent Americans. “It was a mix of surprise, amazement and exhilaration as well as some apprehension, at least in the beginning,” he said. Gadahn said he was in Kandahar, Afghanistan when it happened and that night “there was a celebratory atmosphere… People were congratulating each other on this incredible and historic victory with which Allah had favored us.” And like ISIS, Gadahn also called for attacks in Western countries. “We in al Qaeda have been consistent in calling for attacks on America and its Crusader allies,” he said. ||||| (CNN) He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn , 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \\"likely a separate\\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. No pizza dinner in Pakistan A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \\"providing aid and comfort\\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \\"Most Wanted Terrorists.\\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \\"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. Tearing up his U.S. passport In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \\"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \\"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\\" he said. \\"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \\"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. |||||","completion":"A high-profile Al Qaeda member, Adam Gadahn, recently lectured ISIS directly in a new Al Qaeda publication, warning them that if they continue their extreme actions, Allah will not grant them paradise in the afterlife.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a lid that isn't the proper size for the pot can have a direct effect on the process of obtaining fresh water through the method described. Step-by-Step Process with Justifications: 1. Place the water in a pot: This is the initial step to start the process and add the water with the salt in a container that can be heated. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover: The purpose of this step is to create a surface for the water vapor to condense on. However, since the cover is slightly too large, there will not be a perfect seal between the pot and the cover. This may cause some water vapor to escape, reducing the overall efficiency of the process. 3. Place a larger pot under the first: This larger pot is meant to collect the fresh water as it drips from the original pot's cover. 4. Heat water to evaporation: By applying heat to the water, the water will turn into vapor and rise, leaving the salt behind in the original pot. 5. Water vapor will collect on the lid: As the water vapor rises, it will come into contact with the cooler cover and begin to condense back into liquid water. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water: The condensed water on the cover will eventually drip down into the larger pot, thus collecting fresh water. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot: As the water evaporates, the salt will be left behind in the original pot as solid residue. With the perturbation of having an improperly sized lid, more salt may drip inside the fresh water pot because the water vapor may carry along salt particles with it through the gaps between the pot and the cover. This could lead to the fresh water being contaminated with salt, which compromises the overall goal of obtaining fresh water through this process. Therefore, the perturbation has a direct effect on the process and its desired outcome."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: \\"What did the Hurricanes do 9 years after moving to Raleigh?\\" Context: \\"The National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes franchise moved to Raleigh in 1997 from Hartford, Connecticut (where it was known as the Hartford Whalers).

Article: A report brought back by most visitors to the US is how friendly, polite, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \\"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

However, some people think it is not a good idea. There are a number of disadvantages in studying abroad. The following paragraphs will explain why students have these views and the advantages of studying abroad will be discussed. Students studying abroad may suffer from racial discrimination . As they left their home country, they will become part of a minority group in the new country. The majority group may have a sense of superiority and try to bully them. It is common that Americans or the British discriminate against people from other countries since many of them think that white people are better than others. In addition, the students may lose their own cultures. Since they have moved to a new place, all the thing there - people, lifestyle and the living environment---would be different from those in their own country. As they will have close contact with the local people and culture, they will be influenced by the new culture even without realizing it. It is ironic that a Chinese person speaks better English than Chinese and forgets about Chinese culture after studying abroad for a few years. On the other hand, studying abroad will widen the view of students. Although they may give up their own culture, they can really learn from others. As students of the modern world , they should not limit their scope to their home country, but get exposed to the world. Studying abroad can help them expand their horizon and learn many things in the host country, as they will meet and make friends with people from all over the world. So, studying abroad is good for them. Furthermore, students will learn how to be mature and independent. Students, when in their home country, usually rely on their parents.

Given the question: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.

He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions. In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the dilution effect and the examples provided, we can determine the answer step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the dilution effect: The dilution effect suggests that animals living in larger groups have a lower individual risk of being attacked because each animal is just one of many targets in the group. Step 2: Apply the dilution effect to the question: In the given question, we have two cases: - Case A: Wildebeests crossing the river in a very large group during the migration - Case B: Wildebeests crossing the river in smaller groups at other times of the year Step 3: Consider the impact of group size: Lions attack the wildebeests in both cases. However, according to the dilution effect, in larger groups, the risk of attack for each individual wildebeest should be lower compared to the risk of attack for each individual in smaller groups. Step 4: Determine the case with the lower risk of attack: Based on the dilution effect, the individual risk of attack should be lower in Case A (large groups) when compared to Case B (smaller groups). Conclusion: The answer is Case A, as wildebeests crossing the river in a very large group would have a lower risk of attack from the lions compared to those crossing in smaller groups."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I assumed it was a flat tire . Which was going to be impossible to change considering I did n't have the right shoes . I pulled over , and as I glanced in the rear view mirror , I noticed something shining . Answer the following question: what is the reason my shoes preclude me from changing a tire ?","completion":"The reason your shoes preclude you from changing a tire can be attributed to several factors that could make the process challenging, uncomfortable, or even hazardous. Footwear plays a vital role in maintaining safety and enabling proper body mechanics while tackling tasks that require physical effort, stability, and precision. Here are a few reasons why having the right shoes is essential while changing a tire: 1. Lack of protection: Inappropriate footwear, such as sandals, flip-flops, or high heels, do not provide adequate protection for your feet during a tire change. Changing a flat tire involves handling various tools and manipulating the heavy tire itself. Wearing appropriate shoes with reinforced toe caps or puncture-resistant soles can protect your feet from potential injuries caused by falling objects or sharp debris. 2. Insufficient grip and stability: Changing a tire requires you to exert significant force and maintain a stable stance while using a lug wrench and lifting the vehicle with a jack. The wrong shoes, especially those with smooth or slippery soles, might not offer the necessary grip on the ground. This could make it challenging to apply the required torque to loosen lug nuts without losing balance, posing a risk of injury and making the tire-changing process difficult. 3. Poor ergonomics: Shoes that do not provide the proper support for your feet and arches can lead to incorrect body posture and strain on your lower back and leg muscles. Since changing a tire involves bending, squatting, and lifting, wearing inappropriate footwear could result in discomfort or physical strain, ultimately making the task more challenging and time-consuming. 4. Decreased ability to apply force: Wearing shoes with flexible soles can make it difficult to apply adequate pressure while using tools like wrenches or a tire iron. Firm-soled shoes, like work boots, help distribute the force evenly across your foot, allowing you to effectively loosen and tighten lug nuts during a tire change. 5. Impaired mobility: Changing a tire demands a certain degree of mobility, such as moving around the vehicle, kneeling down, or shifting positions. Shoes that restrict your movement or compromise your agility may negatively affect your ability to perform the task effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, wrong shoe choices can hinder your ability to change a tire effectively and safely. Wearing appropriate footwear, such as sturdy work boots or closed-toe shoes with good grip and support, can significantly improve your overall tire-changing experience and prevent potential accidents or injuries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: To be honest, people don’t usually ask me this. Instead, they want to know things like “How do I keep my mother from falling?” or “What should I do? My grandfather’s been falling.” After all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult’s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving. So, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it’s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall. If you want to learn more, you’re in the right place. In this post, I’ll cover: * How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent — or yourself — safer, * Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips, * The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls, * A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself. First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can — and should — try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.

Barajas, Menefee and Perez each face at least 20 counts of grand theft and securities fraud. If convicted on all counts, each faces up to 20 years in state prison, authorities said. As members of the the Armstrong Elementary School PTA, the women were able to gain the trust of many of their victims during school events and at social functions, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Mike Parker. The victims believed they were investing in the AltaDena Dairy company, a firm the women said would get high rates of return because they had exclusive rights to distribute those products at Disneyland, Disney Hotels and to small retailers, Parker said. ||||| MARICELA BARAJAS JULIANA MENEFEE EVA PEREZ DIAMOND BAR - Three former members of a local PTA were arrested for allegedly running an investment scam that defrauded more than 40 people out of millions. Investigators said the suspects earned the trust of their victims as members of the Neil A. Armstrong Elementary School PTA in Diamond Bar. Two of the suspects, 41-year-old Maricela Barajas and 50-year-old Juliana Menefee, were arrested Tuesday at their Diamond Bar homes. The third suspect, 51-year-old Eva Perez, is already serving an 11-year sentence in prison for a fraud case in San Bernardino County. She is facing additional charges from this case. Deputies said she has residences in Chino and Diamond Bar. The arrests came after a six month investigation by the sheriff's Commercial Crimes Bureau. The suspects allegedly claimed to have the exclusive rights to sell AltaDena Dairy products at Disneyland, Disney Hotels and to small retailers and promised investors returns of up to 100 percent. About 14 million was collected during the scheme from 2008 to 2010. Of that an estimated 10 million was returned to investors to keep new money coming in while the suspects allegedly kept about 4 million, according to investigators. Detectives think the suspects used the money on lavish vacations, expensive hotels, new cars, and at casinos in California and Nevada. None of the money has been recovered. The alleged scheme started to unravel when the investors pressed for Advertisement payment. Detective said the suspects organized meetings and attempted to pacify investors by explaining the delays in payment were a result of an internal audit of the business. By then one of the victims reported the scheme to the sheriff's Walnut/Diamond Bar station. Sheriff's officials said many of the investors took out second mortgages on their homes, maxed out their credit cards and invested their life savings. All transactions were done in cash and the losses ranged from 5,000 to 208,000. The victims came from all over the Southland: Chino, Diamond Bar, Gardena, Granada Hills, Lawndale, Los Angeles, North Hollywood, Norwalk, Pacoima, Pico Rivera, Pomona, Rancho Cucamonga, Redondo Beach, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Fe Springs, South Gate, Torrance, Whittier, Wilmington, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

June stereotyped Greg as being aggressive instead of gentle because she thought males were usually the","completion":"dominant, assertive gender. She had been raised in a traditional set-up where males were seen as strong and determined individuals who would stop at nothing to get what they wanted. Over time and due to her exposure to various types of men in her life, she had formed a generalized idea that all men were the same, which led to her selectively categorizing Greg as being aggressive. This unconscious, yet ingrained, gender bias was not without its roots in societal scripts and mainstream media. Reflecting deeper, June could see how a great deal of her perception about men was influenced by movie characters that portrayed men as aggressive, brutish creatures with an undeniable show of brute strength and palpability. Televised sports events, where aggression in men was almost given, further propagated this stereotype. However, this stereotype was flawed in many ways. It failed to recognize the spectrum of human emotions that men are capable of showing. It succumbed to a monolithic representation, which in turn was an inaccurate portrayal of the complexity and depth of masculine identity. In stereotyping Greg as aggressive, June disregarded the varied facets of his personality, the same way society often pigeonholes men into singular, often distorted, roles. This casual sexism in June's perception led to her overlooking Greg's multiple strengths, which weren't necessarily aligned with the traditional image of masculinity. He wasn't just bold and strong but was also caring, compassionate, and empathetic. Greg had a nurturing side to him that wasn't synonymous with societal-defined masculinity, but it formed an equally integral part of his identity. Greg's gentleness was articulated in several ways. When communicating with his peers, he possessed a calm demeanor and was persistently patient, listening to everyone's opinions before making his own point. He loved building consensus rather than dictating terms. Interestingly, his kindness extended beyond people and was apparent in his love for animals and nature. Moreover, Greg had an emotional depth that clashed with June's preconceived notions of masculinity. His sensitivity allowed him to connect with people on a profound level. He was capable of expressing love, sorrow, fear, and several other emotions that the societal stereotype of men often disregarded. It was vital for June to realize that by stereotyping Greg, she was limiting her understanding of him and, by extension, of men in general. Indeed, stereotypes lack space for individuality, enforcing generalized views and hindering the process of understanding humans as unique individuals. Making pointed conclusions based on gender might have been her subconscious way to navigate her social environment, but it ran the risk of oversimplification and misinterpretation. By reconsidering her perspectives and challenging her biases, June could allow herself to see the all-encompassing nature of humans and respect gender fluidity.

Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

Neighbors said the woman, who they identified as Melora Rivera, was forced to make a dangerous dash onto the roof wearing only the flannel shirt she had been sleeping in to avoid the homeless intruder. “The homeless guy broke in the door and then the lady ran up there,\\" an unidentified female neighbor told KTLA. The transient -- who neighbors said was known in the area -- followed Rivera after she crawled through a window and onto the rooftop. She then hid under an eave to evade him and used a cellphone that she grabbed before escaping to call 911. “He came out to the roof and was on the other side of the roof while she’s trying to tell police ‘there’s an intruder in my house,'\\" said a male neighbor, who did not give his name. Authorities arrived at the scene a short time later, photos showed. According to a neighbor, there had been \\"trouble\\" involving the homeless man earlier that morning. The transient, who was identified as 29-year-old Christian Hicks, was arrested around 9:20 a.m., according to Los Angeles County inmate records. He faced felony charges and was being held on 50,000 bail. Wednesday's incident was part of a growing problem with the number of homeless in the area, according to some residents. Neighbors said the victim was staying elsewhere for the time being because she was too shaken to return to the home. Rivera was an actress who appeared in \\"Sparkle,\\" \\"The Three Canvases,\\" and \\"How to Get Swagger\\" in 2012, according to her page on the website Internet Movie Database, which follows the careers of people in the movie or TV business.

Melora Rivera says she managed to crawl out of a window Wednesday morning, in order to run and hide on her roof after Christian Hicks, 29, allegedly broke into her home. “He managed to break one of these panels and reach in to unlock the door,” Rivera said. “Once I saw him in the house, I knew that we both couldn’t be there. I knew that I didn’t want to have a confrontation with him of any sort, you know, not knowing what his intention was.” Rivera, who says she was in bed at the time of the intrusion, was wearing only a flannel shirt. As she made her way to the roof, with Hicks reportedly pursuing her, Rivera was able to grab her phone and call 911. She hid under an eave as she spoke with the dispatcher. “The drop is, I would guess, more than 20 feet,” Rivera said. “So there was no safely jumping off the roof or coming down from the roof at that point.” Officers soon surrounded the house. “It was my biggest fear was that he was going to be forced by the cops to come hide in basically the same place I was hiding,” Rivera said. Bystander Alexandria Thompson saw what was occurring and captured pictures of the event, posting them to her Twitter. Police said that officers were able to get to Rivera less than two minutes after they had been dispatched. The fire department, too, responded on scene, and helped Rivera down off the roof, as police worked to get Hicks to surrender. Through the pictures posted to social media, residents were able to identify Hicks as a well-known homeless person. It turns out one of Rivera’s neighbors had called police on Hicks at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday for wandering into a yard. “I saw this guy this morning in handcuffs,” Thompson said. “I’ve seen him in my yard. I called the police.” Officers had detained Hicks, but were required to let him go since the caller refused to identify him in person. Meanwhile, Rivera says the overall problem of homelessness needs to be identified and addressed. “I think it’s very obvious for most of us who live around here, when someone seems to be suffering from a mental illness, and to continue to let these people walk around without offering them assistance, to protect them and us. That, I think, is the heart of the problem.” Hicks’ bail has been set at 50,000 and he has been charged with burglary. ||||| Melora Rivera grabbed her phone and ran onto roof.

Despite facing numerous challenges due to his rare aging disease, progeria, Sam maintained an optimistic view on life. He chose not to feel bad for himself or waste energy on negativity, but instead surrounded himself with positive individuals and always moved forward. Progeria is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation that results in the production of an abnormal protein called progerin, which blocks normal cell function.

Progeria causes rapid aging in affected children, leading to a loss of body fat and hair, and an inability to gain weight. Sam's unwavering optimism and determination allowed him to face the challenges brought on by progeria head-on, with both bravery and grace. His exemplary outlook on life caught the attention of many influential people, including famous celebrities and athletes. One such example was when the New England Patriots, one of his favorite teams, wanted to make him their honorary captain for a playoff game. Unfortunately, Sam passed away before he was able to join the team for the game, but they honored him with a moment of silence in his memory. In his TED talk, Sam emphasized the power of positivity and the importance of surrounding oneself with supportive and loving people. His indomitable spirit continues to inspire countless individuals worldwide, reminding them to face their challenges courageously, cherish their loved ones, and always move forward.

At that time, anything seemed more exciting than young. But now as grownups, some adults find they cannot leave childhood behind. They become \\"kidults\\"(kid+adult).

Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, childlike emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\\" said a professor in a Korean University. He added that kidult culture might fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together.

Imagine that one day, someone very important to you suddenly vanishes without any reason. No one knows where they are or what happened to them.

The UN is a big group of countries that try to help people all over the world and make the rules which everyone should follow so that people will be safe, happy, and free. They have helpers called human rights investigators who work very hard to find out who is treating people badly on earth. Today, the UN human rights investigators are worried about what is happening in a place called Syria. They say that the Syrian government has been doing something very bad – they have been making people disappear. This is scary because if people suddenly go missing, their families and friends will be very scared and sad. The UN helpers think this is part of a plan to scare lots of people in Syria. They call it a \\"widespread campaign of terror.\\" It's like when a bully at school scares many kids so they will listen and do what the bully wants. The Syrian government is doing this to make people listen to them and do what they say. What the UN people are doing to help is finding out as many details as they can about what's happening in Syria and looking for ways to make things better for the people who live there. Even though it is hard for them, they keep trying because they want to make the world a better and safer place for everyone. So next time you hear about \\"enforced disappearances\\" and Syria, remember that the UN and its helpers are working hard to fix things and make the world a better place.

Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago.

On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mike was reading about climate change. The author compared two different time periods, era A and era B. Era A was set in the present day. But era B was set in the year 2040. Mike was surprised to find how Arctic area would change in the coming years. Would era B see less or more ice in the Arctic than era A? Answer:","completion":"Era B, set in the year 2040, would see significantly less ice in the Arctic as compared to Era A, which is present day. There are several reasons for this, which can be analyzed through understanding the impact of climate change on the Arctic and how various factors contribute to the accelerated melting of the polar ice. 1. Global Warming: One of the primary reasons for the decrease in Arctic ice in the coming years is global warming. As the Earth continues to warm, the average temperature of the planet is increasing. This leads to the melting of polar ice at an accelerated rate. According to scientific predictions, if the current trend of global warming continues, the Arctic could experience ice-free summers very soon, possibly within the next couple of decades. 2. Albedo Effect: The albedo effect refers to the reflectivity of a surface. Ice and snow, being white, have a high albedo and can reflect as much as 80% of the sun's energy back into space. However, as the ice melts, more dark-colored water and land surfaces are exposed, consequently reducing the albedo effect. Dark surfaces absorb more of the sun's energy, causing temperatures to rise even further, which in turn results in more ice melt. 3. Ocean and Atmospheric Currents: The ocean and atmospheric currents play a critical role in distributing heat around the globe. However, with rising global temperatures, these currents are being altered, leading to further warming in the Arctic. For example, the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, extends its heating effect further into the Arctic, contributing to the melting of sea ice. 4. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The excess greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, emitted by human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This increased heat accelerates the warming of the planet and contributes to melting of the polar ice caps. 5. Permafrost Thawing: As the Arctic warms, the permafrost - which refers to the permanently frozen ground in polar regions - begins to thaw. As it thaws, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and carbon dioxide. These additional greenhouse gases further amplify the global warming effect, creating a feedback loop which exacerbates ice melting in the Arctic. In conclusion, Era B, set in the year 2040, will see a substantial decrease in Arctic ice levels as compared to Era A, which is present day. This loss of ice is primarily driven by global warming and the subsequent impacts it has on various environmental factors such as the albedo effect, changes in ocean and atmospheric currents, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and thawing of permafrost. Addressing climate change has become even more crucial, as the rapid melting of the polar ice is expected to have dire consequences for the Earth's environment, ecosystems, and overall climate stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I really really REALLY wanted to like this place! I came to Cherry out of convenience. I own a salon and many of my own clients go to cherry and have beautiful lashes. When my lash girl was unable to accommodate my hours I called cherry to set up my first appt. and I saw Ariana! I loved my lashes and I loved Cherry. I had a set of lashes on from my previous girl and Ariana said they were quality and could just do a full. I liked them so much I started referring my own clients and even called my mom in an appt. for a fill since she had the same lashes from the same girl I had been seeing and Ariana said she could fill them. This is when it gets bad... On the day of my moms appt about a half hour AFTER her appt was to begin she called me and asked if it was normal to be waiting so long. Turns out Ariana had gone home early. No one bothered to call or even tell my mom when she got there! Just let he sit and wait! Anyhow she rescheduled an appt with Ariana for they following day and cherry offered her a discount. She shows up for her appt and a lash girl who she thought was Arian starts removing her previous lashes in a painful manor. While she was sucking back her snot (she must have been sick or partied to hard the night before) she applied a sparse set of lashes to my mothers lashes..after the appt my mother finds out this girl is not Ariana. I felt horrible I referred my mother to be treated this way:( So the day arrives for my appt with Ariana. I sit down and a bit later a girl calls me back. It was NOT ARIANA! So I go to the desk and ask what's up. They tell me Ariana is no longer with them. Ok, well thanks for the heads up! Anyhow I follow the new girl back to get my fill. I think she spent half the hour prepping and combing. When she was done she explained she was adding a black coating to them. She showed me. They looked OK. I wasn't too impressed but was sick of complaining already and they were giving me a discount for not letting me know I was being sent to someone new. I After about a day I realized my fill was barely a fill and the coating must had coated my natural lashes and worn off to show I had hardly any lashes:( I called to see if I could schedule another fill ASAP. I am pretty busy and couldn't find time to fit it in for about a week so I just scheduled my two week out for a fill plus thinking this was the only way to get nice full lashes. She promised me Taylor would be the best for me and I was looking forward to seeing her. Today was my appt with Taylor. Just got a call she was going home early and they would like to reschedule me with someone else. REALLY Cherry? I'm done. Bad business. I'll be going back to my girl.

Buying cheap clothes was normal for Eric but not Jason because Select from: A). Eric was very rich.; B). Jason was very rich.;","completion":"B). Jason was very rich. Buying cheap clothes was normal for Eric but not Jason because Jason was very rich. This statement brings to light the differences in their financial situations and how it impacted their choices when it came to purchasing clothes. While Eric was comfortable with and perhaps even preferred affordable clothing options, Jason's wealth led him to make different choices in terms of shopping for attire. Being very rich, Jason likely had more disposable income and thus the luxury to shop for higher quality, more expensive clothing options. Wealthier individuals often have more financial freedom, which can translate into making purchases that may not be deemed necessary or practical by those with less means. Additionally, being wealthy may come with social expectations that would encourage Jason to dress in a way that reflects his financial status. Clothing can be a visible indicator of one's social standing, and Jason might have felt obligated to dress in a manner that reflects his affluence. In contrast, Eric may not have had the same financial resources as Jason, leading him to prioritize affordability when shopping for clothes. Many people find it essential to budget carefully when it comes to clothing and other personal expenses, especially when one's income is limited. It's possible that Eric was completely content with his choice to buy cheaper clothes and didn't feel the need to impress others through his clothing choices, whether due to a lack of societal pressure or simply valuing different priorities. This difference in their financial situation might stem from various factors, such as career choices, inherited wealth, or opportunities they each had throughout their lives. It's important to acknowledge that wealth can be a complex, multi-faceted concept influenced by numerous factors, and understanding why someone might be very rich or not requires delving deeper into their personal experiences and circumstances. In conclusion, the sentence insinuates that the reason behind Eric's preference for cheap clothes and Jason's avoidance of them is rooted in their contrasting financial circumstances. As Jason was very rich, his attitude towards clothing might have been shaped by societal expectations, his desire to display his wealth, or the simple luxury of having more disposable income to spend on higher-priced clothing items. On the other hand, Eric, likely with more limited financial resources, might prioritize affordability, finding himself satisfied with cheaper clothes and perhaps valuing different priorities in life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Flogging harms offenders less than imprisonment Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"To evaluate the claim that flogging, or corporal punishment, harms offenders less than imprisonment, it is essential to analyze various aspects such as the impact on physical health, mental health, social repercussions, and rehabilitation potential. Here are some points to support this claim: 1. Duration: Flogging is typically a prompt and relatively short-lived punishment, while imprisonment can last for several years. While flogging may cause intense temporary pain, it does not involve prolonged suffering, allowing offenders to reintegrate into society more quickly. 2. Physical Health: In some cases, flogging may cause less harm to an individual's physical health than imprisonment. Flogging often results in injuries that can heal within a matter of weeks, whereas long-term imprisonment can lead to chronic health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease due to a lack of exercise and appropriate medical care. 3. Mental Health: A significant concern regarding imprisonment is the negative impact on an offender's mental health. Long-term incarceration can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. In comparison, flogging does not involve long periods of confinement, potentially reducing the risk of developing mental health issues. 4. Overcrowding in Prisons: Prison overcrowding is a significant issue, which often results in unsanitary living conditions and increased violence among inmates. By using alternative punishments like flogging, the strain on the prison system could be reduced, lessening the potential harm experienced by offenders. 5. Family Relationships: Those who are imprisoned for long periods are often separated from their families, leading to fractured relationships and negative consequences for spouses and children. On the other hand, flogging allows offenders to return to their families sooner, potentially preserving family bonds. 6. Employment opportunities: Imprisonment often results in the loss of employment opportunities as ex-prisoners face discrimination upon their release. In many cases, individuals struggle to find work and may be at risk of reoffending. Flogging, with its faster reintegration process, may allow offenders to retain their jobs or find new ones relatively easier. 7. Rehabilitation: Incarceration is often viewed as providing an opportunity for rehabilitation through education and job training programs. However, the effectiveness of these programs is debated, and many prisoners do not receive adequate rehabilitation services. Although flogging does not inherently offer rehabilitation, the shorter duration of punishment allows offenders to seek help and reintegrate into society sooner. 8. Stigma: While both flogging and imprisonment carry a social stigma, the long-lasting effects of imprisonment can lead to ostracism and marginalization that persist even after release. In contrast, flogging is a more immediate punishment with potentially less enduring social consequences. While these points suggest that flogging might harm offenders less than imprisonment in some aspects, it is crucial to recognize that the ethics and effectiveness of corporal punishment are widely debated. Human rights advocates often argue against flogging, as it could be seen as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Therefore, it is important to carefully balance and analyze these supporting points against criticism and concerns about flogging as a method of punishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A California school that stopped students from wearing American flag T-shirts on Cinco de Mayo didn't violate their constitutional rights, an appeals court ruled Thursday. The school's approach, according to the appeals court, kept students safe in a climate of racial tension. \\"The controversy and tension remained,\\" a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said in their opinion, \\"but the school's actions presciently avoided an altercation.\\" School officials were worried about violence and disruption of school activities \\"and their response was tailored to the circumstance,\\" the opinion said.

The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in. Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisonerâs name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and SchÃ¼tte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him. The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners' side, this is Tarek, and on the guardsâ side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: \\"Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles.\\" From that moment on, the guards start...

The answer to the question: What was the first name of the man Sinatra lumped in with \\"cretinous goons\\"? is inside the article: Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.\\"Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues. The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time. On December 20, Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming King Creole, in which 350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most? Options: A: A Frenchman just quarreled with the barber who did his hair badly in New York. B: An American just had a wonderful dinner in a well known restaurant in New York. C: A Japanese businessman asked for a pizza delivery from a Pizza Hut in New York. D: A Chinese student enjoyed his meal in a famous fast food restaurant in New York.

Many restaurants have now integrated their mobile apps and websites with popular food delivery platforms to reach a broader customer base and adapt to the growing demand for food delivery services.

Step 5: Discuss the importance of loyalty programs and personalized offers Mobile technology has allowed restaurants to gather valuable insights about their customers' preferences and spending habits. By analyzing this data, restaurants can offer personalized promotions, discounts, and loyalty programs to incentivize customers to return. As a result, customers benefit from exclusive offers tailored to their tastes, and restaurants can foster strong customer relationships and improve their overall dining experience.

Translate to English","completion":"The divine imprint placed upon each of God's children is as true as the mark placed upon the doorposts of Jewish dwellings to protect them from [221] universal destruction. This statement emphasizes the significance and truth of the divine imprints or manifestations of God's love and design for each of His children, both individually and collectively. Just as the ancient Jews marked their doorposts with the blood of a lamb to signal their faithfulness to God and to secure their protection from the destructive plagues sent upon Egypt, each person carries within them a mark of God's love and purposive plan for their lives. The doorpost markings in the Old Testament were a powerful and prophetic symbol of faith, obedience, and provision. This not only demonstrated the faith of the people but also showcased the unwavering love and protection from God. Similarly, the divine imprints within every person reveal the uniqueness and purpose that God wants each individual to fulfill in their lives. In the contemporary world, these divine imprints can manifest in various ways. For instance, it may be seen through the talents and abilities that each person possesses, or through the purpose and calling in life that aligns with God's plan. Additionally, it may be observed in the range of physical and emotional attributes, which collectively reflect the diversity and creativity of God's design. The divine imprints, much like the ancient doorpost markings, are not only a source of protection and guidance, but they also serve as a reminder of the special relationship that God holds with each of His children. By recognizing these imprints and embracing them in their lives, individuals can find their true purpose and contribute meaningfully to the world around them in accordance with God's plan. These divine imprints are not limited to any specific race, religion, or social status, but rather can be perceived in every human being. This reinforces the idea of the universality of God's love and His intention to provide protection, purpose, and meaning to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. Thus, the statement underlines the significance and truthfulness of the divine imprint present in each of God's children, drawing a parallel to the mark placed on Jewish doorposts. It serves as a reminder that God's love and protection are continually at work within every individual, just as the doorpost markings symbolized God's protection in an ancient context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
