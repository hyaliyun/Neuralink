Lobbyist The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Rise of Eddie Genre: Political Drama Plot: Act 1: Eddie Huxley, a charismatic and ambitious man in his mid-30s, has always been intrigued by the world of politics. Born and raised in a small town in the Midwest, he slowly climbs the political ladder as a local councilman and eventually becomes the mayor of his town. Despite his humble beginnings, Eddie has always dreamt of making it big in the world of politics and achieving a significant political office in the U.S. Meanwhile, Eddie's long-time friend and political advisor, Olivia Johnston, recognizes his potential and encourages him to push his ambitions further. Olivia, who has been a lobbyist and a seasoned political operator on the national level for years, sees greatness in Eddie and believes that he could become a powerful figure within the U.S. political system. She convinces Eddie to move to Washington D.C. to be closer to the epicenter of American politics. Act 2: After relocating to the capital, Eddie learns the inside workings of the political machine and becomes fascinated by the power and influence lobbyists wield behind the scenes. With Olivia's guidance and connections, Eddie starts forging relationships with key people in Congress and amasses a clientele of wealthy corporations and interest groups, successfully lobbying on their behalf. Soon, Eddie becomes a well-known and respected lobbyist in D.C., using his charm and strategic mind to navigate the treacherous waters of American politics. He makes a name for himself, and his influence begins to grow alongside his aspirations. However, achieving such a lofty status comes with its consequences. To maintain and expand his power and influence, Eddie is forced to make some ethically dubious choices, even compromising some of his own morals along the way. These decisions strain his relationship with Olivia, who is concerned that Eddie is losing sight of his original goal and becoming too complacent in his new role, mirroring the very politicians they had once spoken against. Act 3: As Eddie's reputation as a formidable lobbyist grows, so does the scrutiny from the media and an ambitious investigative journalist named Susan Wells. Susan starts to dig deeper into Eddie's past and lobbying activities, uncovering several scandals and corrupt deals. As the pressure mounts, Eddie faces the dilemma of either coming clean and risking his entire career or continuing down the path and jeopardizing his integrity. Simultaneously, Olivia discovers a secret about one of Eddie's most powerful clients, a corrupt multi-billion-dollar corporation with plans to exploit and abuse vulnerable populations. Unable to sit by idly any longer, Olivia urges Eddie to take a stand, let go of his ambitions, and fight for the greater good. Facing a moral crossroads, Eddie must choose between his unyielding quest for power and the opportunity to redeem himself and preserve the values he started with. In a climactic turn of events, Eddie sides with Olivia, risking his reputation and career in the process. Together, they expose the corporation's sinister plan and help bring justice to those affected. Through their courage and determination, Eddie and Olivia rekindle their friendship and recommit themselves to the ideals of public service. Epilogue: Eddie eventually obtains the office of United States Senator for his home state, having built a new political career based on integrity and advocating for change. His transformation from a power-hungry lobbyist to a morally upright, public servant is a testament to the importance of staying true to one's principles in a world plagued by corruption and secrecy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He has written more than 30 plays and nearly the same number of movie screenplays, mostly adaptations of his plays. He has received more combined Oscar and Tony nominations than any other writer. Simon grew up in New York during the Great Depression, with his parents' financial hardships affecting their marriage, giving him a mostly unhappy and unstable childhood. Simon's characters are typically portrayed as \\"imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings\\", according to Koprince, and she traces Simon's style of comedy to that of Menander, a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, the stories also blending humor and tragedy into his themes. Many of Simon's most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of California Suite and Plaza Suite. Before writing, Simon tries to create an image of his characters. He says that the play, Star Spangled Girl which was a box-office failure, was \\"the only play I ever wrote where I did not have a clear visual image of the characters in my mind as I sat down at the typewriter.\\" Simon considers \\"character building\\" as an obligation, stating that the \\"trick is to do it skillfully\\". While other writers have created vivid characters, they have not created nearly as many as Simon: \\"Simon has no peers among contemporary comedy playwrights,\\" states biographer Robert Johnson. Simon's characters often amuse the audience with sparkling \\"zingers,\\" believable due to Simon's skill with writing dialogue. He reproduces speech so \\"adroitly\\" that his characters are usually plausible and easy for audiences to identify with and laugh at. His characters may also express \\"serious and continuing concerns of mankind ... rather than purely topical material\\". McGovern notes that his characters are always impatient \\"with phoniness, with shallowness, with amorality\\", adding that they sometimes express \\"implicit and explicit criticism of modern urban life with its stress, its vacuity, and its materialism.\\" However, Simon's characters will never be seen thumbing his or her nose at society.\\" Entity:","completion":"The entity in this text is Marvin Neil Simon, an American playwright, screenwriter, and author."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"the looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant 's roots' growth in that soil\\" and \\"roots are basic to growth, development and expansion\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Possible answers: (i). support (ii). soft soil (iii). clay soil (iv). no soil (v). nutrients (vi). alluvial (vii). sandy soil (viii). loose soil A:","completion":"Based on the hints given by the teacher, we can infer that the best answer to the question \\"What soil helps a plant grow?\\" is (viii). loose soil. The teacher mentioned that \\"the looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant's roots' growth in that soil.\\" Loose soil is indeed an important factor in plant growth. When soil has a loose structure, it allows for better penetration of water and oxygen. These elements are necessary for the process of nutrient uptake and root growth, which aids in the overall growth and development of the plant. Furthermore, the teacher stated that \\"roots are basic to growth, development and expansion.\\" This statement highlights the importance of strong and healthy root systems for plants. Healthy roots hold plants in place, absorb water and essential nutrients, and store sugars and carbohydrates that provide energy for growth. Considering the choices given, some soils are better than others for plant growth: (i). Support is not a soil type but rather a characteristic that is important in plant growth. (ii). Soft soil is relatively vague, without specific information about its composition or structure. (iii). Clay soil can be high in nutrients, but it is generally heavy and compacted, restricting root growth. (iv). No soil is not an ideal environment, as it lacks essential components of growth. (v). Nutrients are essential for plant growth, but they do not constitute a type of soil. (vi). Alluvial soil, deposited by rivers, is often fertile and can be suitable for plant growth, but it doesn't necessarily indicate looseness. (vii). Sandy soil is very loose, but it drains quickly and lacks the water retention needed for many plants. Given the list of possible answers and the focus on soil looseness provided by the teacher's hints, the best answer is (viii). loose soil. This type of soil creates an optimal environment for root growth, which in turn allows plants to access the water and nutrients required for their overall development and expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","completion":"to appoint to those who mourn in zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of yahweh, that he may be glorified. The verse you provided is from Isaiah 61:3, which belongs to the Hebrew Bible and is also part of the Old Testament in Christian Bibles. This specific verse is a part of the Book of Isaiah, traditionally attributed to the Prophet Isaiah himself. The Book of Isaiah in its entirety contains 66 chapters divided into two main sections: chapters 1-39 and 40-66. The first section presents a series of condemnations and warnings for the people of Israel, while the latter section revolves around visions of hope and comfort as they face adversity. Isaiah 61:3 is found in the second section, where the verses are primarily characterized by themes of hope, comfort, and restoration. This specific verse outlines God's promise to bestow various blessings upon those who are in mourning or experiencing hardships in Zion, bringing solace and joy to their lives, as they remain faithful to their beliefs. The transformation of \\"ashes to garlands\\" symbolizes the shift from grief, pain, and desolation to a state of joy, beauty, and celebration. Similarly, the \\"oil of joy\\" is an important representation of God's healing and soothing presence, signifying the replacement of mourning and sorrow with happiness. \\"The garment of praise\\" metaphor represents the power of praise and worship as a tool to replace heaviness and despair with an uplifted spirit and rejoicing. By exchanging a sense of defeat and desperation with gratitude and positive energy, individuals can experience a spiritual renewal that brings them closer to God. The verse also introduces the concept that these individuals will become \\"trees of righteousness\\" and \\"the planting of Yahweh.\\" The tree is a common biblical symbol of stability, growth, and strength. As these individuals grow into faithful followers of God, they become strong and firmly rooted in their faith, resembling healthy trees that have been planted by Yahweh Himself. Ultimately, this transformation will result in God being glorified through their faithfulness and spiritual growth. In sum, Isaiah 61:3 exemplifies a message of hope and encouragement for those in mourning and despair. By receiving God's blessings and support, they can not only find solace and happiness but also be transformed into steadfast followers who glorify their Creator. By putting this verse into lower case, as you requested, the emphasis remains clear on the powerful message contained within, while the stylistic change serves as a reminder that the essence of the verse is embedded in the powerful themes it conveys, rather than its grammatical presentation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP ( external plate resistor ) and Rload .","completion":"First, let's break down the content in both statements: (a) RK is the cathode resistor and rtot is the external combination of RP (parallel resistor) and rload. (b) RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload. To evaluate if both statements have the same meaning, we will analyze each of the components used in the phrases: 1. RK: In both statements, RK is referred to as the cathode resistor. This term remains consistent in both, demonstrating that they are describing the same component. 2. rtot vs. Rtot: It seems that the only difference here is the capitalization of the letters. In the context of the statements, these terms should be treated as interchangeable, as they both likely represent the total resistance in the circuit. 3. RP: In statement (a), RP is referred to as the parallel resistor, and in statement (b), RP is described as the external plate resistor. Although the terms used to describe the resistor are different, both point to a resistor that is in parallel with another resistor in the circuit. This subtle difference in wording may indicate the same element being described, given the overall context. 4. rload vs. Rload: Similar to rtot and Rtot, this difference lies in capitalization. Considering the context, these terms should be treated as interchangeable, both representing the load resistance in the circuit. 5. External combination vs. parallel combination: In both statements, there is a description of how the resistors are combined, impacting the overall resistance. Statement (a) mentions the external combination of RP and rload, while statement (b) specifies the parallel combination of RP and Rload. From the context, the term \\"external combination\\" in statement (a) most likely implies a parallel connection as well, as there are no other resistors being discussed. Thus, these terms can be assumed to have the same meaning. Based on the analysis above, both statements (a) and (b) convey the same meaning but with different wordings and capitalizations. They both describe the same circuit components (RK, RP, and Rload) and their relationships (parallel combination).

Roy's arrest followed issues with the foundations of his OPTIONS: - AKA property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - America property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - British property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - Duncan Roy property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - Eddie Wrenn property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - Immigration and Customs Enforcement property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - L.A. property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - LA Times property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. - Los Angeles County Sheriff property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value.","completion":"L.A. property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. Explanation: The correct answer mentions \\"L.A. property\\" because the story is about Duncan Roy, a British film director, who is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff. So, the property being discussed would be in Los Angeles (L.A.). The other options are wrong because: - AKA, America, British, Duncan Roy, Eddie Wrenn, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, LA Times, and Los Angeles County Sheriff in the options do not make sense as they are either unrelated or not the location of the property we are looking for."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A website has been ordered to remove a claim that the MMR jab could cause autism in children by the Advertising Standards Agency. The children’s immunisation service, babyjabs.co.uk, claimed experts believe the vaccine 'could be causing autism in up to 10% of. autistic children in the UK'. It also said: 'Most experts now agree that the. large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but. also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.' The babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an 'informed choice' about child vaccinations. It added that parental fears the jab caused autism. were 'supported' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had. been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children. However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism. The ASA ruled: 'Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the ‘real increase in the number of children with autism’ was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase.' They added: 'Because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case, and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.' BabyJabs Ltd denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded: 'We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated'. But the ASA said: 'The Cochrane review, looking at the general evidence available, could find no significant association between MMR immunisation and autism. 'We noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism, but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the MMR vaccine.' They added: 'We considered that consumers would understand from the (advert) that the MMR vaccine was likely to have caused autism in up to 10% of autistic children in the UK, namely between 300 and 400 children a year. 'We noted we had not seen any evidence, such as a clinical trial or study, which actively showed that the MMR vaccine was likely to cause autism in between 300 and 400 children a year. 'Because we did not consider that we had seen sufficient evidence to support the claim we concluded it was misleading.' Highlights:","completion":"1. A website named babyjabs.co.uk was told by the Advertising Standards Agency to remove a claim that the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine could cause autism in children. 2. The website had stated that experts believed this vaccine could be causing autism in up to 10% of autistic children in the UK, a claim the agency said was unsupported by evidence and thus misleading. 3. The Advertising Standards Agency explained that both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no solid proof that the MMR vaccine causes autism. 4. The agency added that it was incorrect to imply that a rise in the number of children with autism is partly due to the vaccine, without firm evidence to back up this claim. 5. While the site’s company, BabyJabs Ltd, pointed to past research suggesting a possible link, the Advertising Standards Agency insisted that all general evidence reviewed indicates no significant connection between MMR immunisation and autism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish on November 28, 1967, it is the first discovered radio pulsar. The power and regularity of the signals were briefly thought to resemble an extraterrestrial beacon, leading the source to be nicknamed LGM-1 (for \\"little green men\\"). Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"PSR B1919+21 is also known as LGM-1. \\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it's accurate to say that PSR B1919+21 is also known as LGM-1. This nickname, which stands for \\"little green men,\\" came about due to the power and regularity of the signals emitted by this pulsar. When they were first discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish on November 28, 1967, the nature of these signals led some to speculate, if only briefly, that they might be coming from an extraterrestrial beacon. Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles. This radiation can only be observed when the beam of emission is pointing towards the Earth, much the same way a lighthouse can only be seen when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer. This is what gives pulsars a pulsed appearance, with the interval between pulses equivalent to the rotational period of the neutron star. In the specific case of PSR B1919+21, this pulsar has both a period — the time between pulses — of 1.3373 seconds and a pulse width — the duration of each pulse — of 0.04 seconds. This steady, rapid-fire emission of signals every 1.34 seconds, combined with the precisely tuned nature of the signals, would have set it apart from the general background noise of the universe. This uniqueness is presumably what led to the initial speculation of an artificial, extraterrestrial source. With the source soon determined to be a pulsar, the first ever discovered, the LGM-1 nickname appears to have persisted as a humorous or historical reference to the initial confusion. So while this clever nickname may not be the most scientifically accurate or frequently used designation for PSR B1919+21, it is undeniably part of its history and provides a fascinating glimpse into the process and progress of astronomical discovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Documents that baseball historians have called the Magna Carta of the game have sold at auction for nearly 3.3 million. SCP auctions says the 1857 papers called the \\"Laws of Base Ball\\" sold early Sunday to an anonymous buyer after more than two weeks of bidding, reports the AP. The auction house had predicted prior to the auction's April 7 start that they could sell for more than 1 million. The anonymous seller hadn't realized the value of the papers he purchased in Texas for 12,000 in 1999. It was only when the auction house appraised them that their significance became clear. The documents thoroughly change the early history of baseball, making Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams the proper father of the modern game, and putting its birth date three years earlier than had been expected. The AP has much more on Doc Adams here. Article:","completion":"Title: The Magna Carta of Baseball: Documents Sell for 3.3 Million, Rewriting Baseball's History and Crediting Doc Adams as the True Father of the Sport The Magna Carta of Baseball, a collection of 1857 documents known as the \\"Laws of Base Ball,\\" has been sold for an astounding 3.3 million at auction—an event that has sent shockwaves through the world of baseball and its historians. The documents, which not only hold great monetary value but are also historically profound, were auctioned off to an anonymous buyer after two weeks of bidding. Although the auction house had predicted a sales price of over 1 million, the final tally far exceeded expectations, leaving many in awe of the significance of these critical papers. However, it wasn't always clear just how valuable these documents were. In 1999, their owner, who remains anonymous, purchased the papers in Texas for a mere 12,000, unaware of the stories they would soon reveal. It was only when the auction house appraised these papers that their true significance became clear—the documents shed new light on the early history of baseball, crediting Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams as the father of the modern game and placing the birth of baseball three years earlier than previously believed. Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams, a figure who may not have been as well-known as other supposed pioneers of the game, such as Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright, now takes his rightful place as the key player in the inception and development of baseball as we know it today. It was Adams who set the foundation for the modern game with his vision and his tireless efforts in the mid 19th-century. He thoroughly developed the sport, overseeing countless rule changes, equipment improvements, and even the very design of the baseball field. The sale of the Laws of Base Ball not only made headlines for the substantial sum it commanded but also for the historical revelations brought forth as a result of the auction. The discovery of these documents has most assuredly rewritten the history of the game, placing baseball's dawn three years earlier than previously thought. This information reshapes our understanding of baseball's growth as a truly American sport, evolving from its English predecessors like rounders and cricket to take on a unique identity that would come to define American pastimes for generations to come. In conclusion, the sale of the Magna Carta of Baseball serves as a shining example of the importance of historical documents in shaping not only the past of the sports we love but also providing a greater understanding of the present and the sports' development over time. The auction has elevated Daniel Lucius \\"Doc\\" Adams to his rightful position as the true father of modern baseball, and the documents' astonishing value serves to strengthen the passion and love for one of America's most storied sports. With the Laws of Base Ball now in the hands of a collector, it is a powerful reminder that our evolution as a society is continuously influenced and shaped by history—and sometimes that history can be worth millions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Europe, the Germans are close to surrender, but in the Pacific the bloody battle for Okinawa is still underway and an invasion of the Japanese home islands is not foreseen until the autumn. American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The mystery stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are famous all over the world. The detective in his stories is called Sherlock Holmes. He solves mysteries in a most surprising way. His assistant, Dr Watson, watches with admiration and then writes up the story of the mystery afterwards. This is a useful story writing skill. Because Watson is not very clever, the story remains a mystery until the end. The readers can sometimes pick up some clues before he does! Then, to make Watson understand the mystery, Holmes has to explain it all, step by step. So we, the readers, get to see it step by step too. Watson is almost as good a character in the story as Sherlock Holmes! The very first time they meet, Holmes greatly surprises Watson. When they are first introduced, Holmes says to Watson, 'How do you do? I see you have been to Afghanistan .' Watson is too amazed by this to ask Holmes how he knows this. Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country. Observation Three At the time, the British army had soldiers at bases in many parts of the world. So there were still a lot of places to choose from. However, Holmes saw that Watson looked very tired and he was always holding his left arm, as if it was painful. So, he had probably been with the army to a place where they were fighting. There was only one place where the British army was fighting at that time: Afghanistan. Question: The writer most probably created the character, Dr Watson, to _ .

Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Question: \\"Why did Katherine represent herself and not seek legal services?\\" Response: \\"She could not afford her own lawyer, and there are not enough legal aid lawyers to help everyone in need\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct. The paragraph explains that Katherine represented herself because she could not afford her own lawyer, and there's a shortage of legal aid lawyers in California, with only one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. This situation contributes to the difficulty in getting legal assistance for people like Katherine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said \\"I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home.\\" With his small daughters and sister Atje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (The Women of Amphissa (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission.

Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies.

It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

Riggs is a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident two years prior and has turned suicidal, and has been taking his anger out on suspects, leading to his superiors requesting his transfer. Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves at odds with each other. Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle. Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner.

They go to see her at her home but it explodes as they approach it. Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris, indicating a professional had set the bomb; children that had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a Special Forces tattoo similar to Riggs', and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker knows more than he has let on.

Tourist flights are not allowed to places above Base Camp which is at an altitude of 5,364 metres (17,600ft). But helicopter companies say they only overfly sights like the Khumbu Icefall and their flights are allowed. There has been no expedition on Everest for the past two years because of a series of disasters. Sixteen Sherpas died on their way to Camp One in an icefall in 2014. At least 18 climbers died at Base Camp after a major earthquake triggered a huge avalanche last year. After the 2014 disaster, authorities moved the climbing route to the middle of the Khumbu Icefall. It is a treacherous section that mountaineers must cross on their way up to the summit of Everest. Sherpas are currently transporting expedition equipment to higher camps for the current climbing season. \\"The sightseeing helicopters are hovering above the Khumbu Icefall and making things difficult for us,\\" said Pasang Kaji Sherpa, a mountain guide with a military expedition team now on Everest. \\"We worry that the vibrations caused by helicopters can crack ice blocks and snow packs on mountains overlooking the Khumbu Icefall. \\"There is a deep-seated fear among Sherpa porters that they may be hit by avalanches this year as well and these helicopters are increasing fears,\\" Pasang Kaji Sherpa added. After the BBC started to investigate whether sightseeing helicopters were permitted to fly to places like the Khumbu Icefall, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) issued a circular to all airlines warning them not to conduct such flights. \\"We have made it clear in the circular that sightseeing flights are simply not allowed in places higher than the base camp,\\" said Rajan Pokhrel, Deputy Director General of CAAN. \\"Only rescue flights during emergencies are allowed in those areas and sometimes we allow special projects like skydiving when recommended by other government authorities.\\" Mr Pokhrel said his office had also heard the Sherpas' concerns. However, airline officials say there is no such danger. \\"We fly 2,340 feet from above the ground and maintain at least 1km distance from the mountains so there is no way the vibration can cause avalanche,\\" said Pabitra Karki, chairman of Airlines Operators Association Nepal (AOAN). \\"We use the French-made Ecureil helicopters for sightseeing which are very light and we carry two to three passengers in each flight.\\" AOAN officials say there are around half a dozen sightseeing flights per week during the climbing season. But other sources at Base Camp said such flights were becoming more frequent. About 20 helicopters are operated by six companies in Nepal but only a handful of pilots are qualified to fly to high altitudes. \\"For Sherpa climbers, especially those carrying equipment for expedition teams, helicopters flying overhead in higher areas is a mentally torturous experience,\\" says Phurba Namgyal Sherpa, general secretary of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. \\"The fragile snow and ice conditions could be disturbed at any time by the rotors of helicopters and that could spell disaster for us. \\"This is an issue we have been discussing for quite some time now but we are not sure where to lodge the complaint.\\" Scaling Mount Everest is the dream of many climbers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to reach the summit Aviation experts say part of the problem is how such flights are policed by the authorities. Officials from CAAN admitted they were not on the ground to monitor such flights but relied on other government agencies based there. \\"Just because we are not there does not mean we don't get to know what happens up there,\\" Mr Pokhrel cautioned. In addition, the Department of Tourism has allowed helicopters to transport ropes and other gear up to Camp One to fix the route, after expedition operators complained that the earthquake had made the Khumbu Icefall more difficult to cross. \\"We fear that such a concession may be misused for more sightseeing and other commercial purposes and increase the risk of avalanche in the region,\\" said Phurba Namgyal Sherpa.","completion":"Sherpa guides have raised concerns that tourist sightseeing helicopters over Everest Base Camp may be increasing the risk of avalanches by causing vibrations that could crack ice blocks and snow.

In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries. Walden listed \\"a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg.\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yehuda"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The text translates to: \\"The information memorandum does not address the implications related to the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales Tax.\\" Here is a detailed explanation: French is a Romance language, which means it evolved from Vulgar Latin, the spoken form of Latin used in everyday life in the late Roman Empire. Today, it is spoken by around 300 million people as a first or second language worldwide. French is an official language in 29 countries, including France, Canada (with both French and English as official languages), Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, and several countries in the African continent, such as Senegal, Mali, and Ivory Coast, among others. The text refers to two types of taxes found in Canada: the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The GST is a federal value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold in Canada. The HST is a combination of the GST and the provincial sales tax (PST), used in some provinces to simplify taxation. The memorandum of information is a document provided to potential investors or interested parties, describing a company's financial position, its core business, and general information about operations; in this case, it doesn't address the tax implications mentioned.

These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school \\"is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876\\".

On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is on display at the house.)

Eric ignored the faith healers prognosis.; [B].

Logan, a strong advocate for the natural and supernatural, avidly tried to persuade his friend about the power of crystals and their potential to heal. Eric, meanwhile, couldn't help but dismiss these ideas as mere nonsense, preferring to put his faith in established medical practices. A chance encounter with a wandering faith healer several weeks before was the source of the disagreement between Eric and Logan. A tall, mysterious figure with a warm, inviting aura, the healer had approached them with promises of wellness and balance. With one look at them, he claimed that he could sense a disrupted flow of energy within their bodies and had recommended they each take a session with him. Guided by his convictions, Logan eagerly accepted and had since then, mostly spoken in glowing terms when referring to his newfound inner peace. Eric, however, declined the faith healer's offer with a polite nod, maintaining his skepticism and rolling his eyes at Logan's anecdotes. Despite their opposing views, Eric and Logan were the best of friends. They always found immense joy in debating various topics, be it scientific, metaphysical, or social. They believed that the key to maintaining such a deep connection was rooted in their mutual respect for one another, regardless of their differing perspectives. While Logan maintained that the insights he experienced through the power of the crystals had dramatically improved his daily life, Eric couldn't help but attribute this improvement to the power of suggestion. The faith healer, as charismatic as he might have been, seemed to him as just another snake oil salesman peddling false hope to vulnerable souls searching for a higher truth. Contrarily, Logan was truly enraptured by the faith healer's wisdom and the possibilities that lay dormant within the crystals. Each session with him brought an unforeseen aspect of his existence bubbling to the surface, be it a harmonization of his body's energies, a connection to his higher self, or even a profound lucidity in his dreamscapes. For Logan, the faith healer was not someone to be ignored; he was a harbinger of a new era of understanding, of achieving the coveted state of spiritual equilibrium. The eventual roadmap to breaking the confines of social conditioning and fostering deep, meaningful connections with others. And so, as the two wandered through a sunlit glade, the pair continued their discourse. Friends by circumstance, yet showcasing the epitome of the inquisitive human spirit. To them, it was not about who was right or wrong, but the discovery and expansion of their horizons. In the end, it remained the ever-pervading enigma of existence - the quest to understand that which lay beyond the visible realm. For Eric and Logan, their contrasting beliefs only served to strengthen the unbreakable bond they shared.

As Grace grapples with the constant strain of her son's illness, she must also navigate financial instability, societal judgment, and relationships, all while ultimately discovering her own strength and resilience. Synopsis: Grace is a strong-willed, single mother living in a small town. Life has been difficult after the sudden passing of her loving husband, Chris, which leaves her with mounting bills and the responsibility of raising their eight-year-old son, Ethan. Ethan is diagnosed with a rare, chronic illness that requires continuous care, vigilance, and expensive treatments. The mother's struggle is highlighted as she tirelessly cares for her fragile son while facing overwhelming challenges. As the sole breadwinner, she works multiple jobs just to make ends meet and cover the costly healthcare bills, all the while ensuring Ethan gets the best possible care. Grace is often exhausted, which adds to the physical and emotional effort needed to manage a family in dire circumstances. Grace then meets Daniel, a caring and understanding doctor whose expertise has been invaluable in Ethan's treatment. An emotional bond forms between Grace and Daniel, but because of the growing gossip and judgment of the small-town community, Grace faces additional challenges. She is torn between seeking happiness in a world that seems to be against her every move and prioritizing her son's needs. To make matters worse, Grace's sister, Susan, offers financial help, but with it comes a price—she questions Grace's ability to continue caring for her son and suggests sending Ethan to a specialized care facility. This proposal triggers an internal conflict for Grace, who is confronted by her love for Ethan and the reality of their circumstances. As Ethan's condition gradually worsens, Grace begins learning more about his disease, connecting with other families facing similar struggles, and advocating for better healthcare options. Eventually, she finds solace and support in a close-knit online community of parents dealing with chronically ill children, creating a network that provides emotional, educational, and financial assistance, solidifying her resolve to fight through every obstacle. As a culmination of emotion, Grace takes one last shot at seeking alternative treatment approaches. With Daniel's help, they manage to enroll Ethan in an experimental treatment program. Despite all the difficulties, Ethan's resilience inspires Grace to take unfathomable risks and fight for her family, demonstrating her indomitable spirit and love for her son. In the emotional climax, after surmounting countless obstacles, Ethan begins to show small, steady improvements. As a result, Grace is brought to the realization that both the struggles and triumphs that life brings are only temporary, and they must embrace the storm together as a family. Embracing the Storm is a heart-wrenching yet inspiring movie focusing on a mother's love and the obstacles faced in caring for a chronically ill child. Through tears, laughter, and the human will to survive, Grace discovers the fierce warrior within, proving that a mother's strength holds no bounds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One exception is at the Tompkins Houses, a city housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where an orange jungle gym adorned with the word “Jail,” a cell door and prison bars has, six years after its installation, set off outrage in the neighborhood and the blogosphere, along with a hasty official response. Children may play cops and robbers all the time, but putting a pretend jail in a public housing playground in a historically black community struck some residents as an insult. “We started complaining because it was like promoting kids to go to jail,” said Natasha Godley, 37, who has a 6-year-old son. The prison look, including the offending word, was part of the original design of the playground, which was made by a company called Landscape Structures and erected in March 2004, the New York City Housing Authority said on Wednesday. But it had not elicited complaints until this week, said Sheila Stainback, an agency spokeswoman. Lumumba Bandele, a lecturer in black history at the City University of New York who lives nearby, said he began complaining to the housing authority and local officials about the playground this past weekend. “The fact is that this community along with six others in New York City makes up the majority of the prison population in New York State,” he said. “And to have this here under the auspices of NYCHA is absolutely insulting.” The jungle gym, tucked behind a building near Throop and Park Avenues, sits across from a handball court adorned with paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. On Sunday, the Web site Black and Brown News published a photo of the jungle gym by Mr. Bandele’s wife, Monifa Bandele, accompanying a critical article about it. “There is no kind, gentle, diplomatic way to describe the offense against a community by this ‘Jail Playground’ on a New York City Housing Authority property,” the article began. Some residents said that complaints about the play set were actually not a new phenomenon. One Housing Authority grounds worker who declined to give her name said that her mother was so incensed about the inscription that, two years ago, she marched over to the play set and covered the word “Jail” with gold spray paint. It was not clear how the word came to be restored. But on Wednesday after the Black and Brown News article was picked up by Brownstoner and other sites, Housing Authority workers arrived to paint over the “Jail.” Later, another worker showed up in painter’s pants and began scouring off the word “Jail” and the fake bars, which appeared stenciled into the play set, with steel wool and paint remover. The authority, Ms. Stainback said, “painted over the equipment as a temporary solution to replacing this part of the playground.” The authority is also looking into who ordered the equipment. Calls to the main office of Landscape Structures were not returned. A woman who answered the phone at one of its sales offices, in Carle Place on Long Island, said the company provides playgrounds for the Housing Authority, “but only by their approval.” She said she had never seen one of the company’s play sets adorned with the word “jail,” but emphasized, “I’m only answering the phones.” Somewhere in the city’s public housing universe, the playground has a twin, Ms. Stainback said. She would not divulge its location, but said that its “Jail” sign and bars would be painted over, too.

Problem:Passage: In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \\"looking glass\\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.

Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - Tim Cain is an American video game developer best known as the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \\"Fallout\\". In 2009 he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Leonard Boyarsky is an American computer game designer and visual artist best known for being one of the key designers of the video games \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Diablo III\\". - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success. - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976.

Movie title: Cannibal Holocaust Context: In 1979, an American film crew disappears in the Amazon rainforest while on an expedition to film a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers alive. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on a local tribe known as the Yacumo and takes a young Yacumo male hostage in order to help negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel. After several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group initially meets hostility and learns that the film team had caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank where they save a smaller group of YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ from certain death. Grateful, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ invite Monroe and his team back to their village, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of friendly YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ women emerge to join him and playfully bathe with him. After, they take him to a shrine where he discovers the rotting remains of the missing American filmmakers. Upset and angered, Monroe decides it is of utmost importance to recover the films. He confronts the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶, during which time he plays a tape recorder of tribal music for them.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band? After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - Simon Solomon Webbe ( born 30 March 1978 ) is an English singer - songwriter , actor and music manager .

Webbe released two solo studio albums in 2005 and 2006 , sold over 700,000 records worldwide and had five UK Top 40 singles . - A misnomer is a word or term that suggests a meaning that is known to be wrong. Misnomers often arise because the thing received its name long before its true nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. \\"Misnomer\\" does not mean \\"misunderstanding\\" or \\"popular misconception\\", and many misnomers remain in legitimate use (that is, being a misnomer does not always make a name incorrect). - The Monkees are an American-British pop rock band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series \\"The Monkees\\", which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British actor and singer Davy Jones.

It's incredible how a single resort and foundation can generate such positive change in a community.

If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \\"12345678\\"or \\"QWERTY\\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \\"I don't care\\", \\"Whatever\\", \\"I love you\\" or their opposite, \\"I hate you\\". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol.

Imagine you have a really big jar with lots of colorful balls in it. You take out a certain number of balls (268418*c) and then put more balls back in (536853*c), and finally, take out some more balls (268194*c). At the end, you have 13496 colorful balls left in the jar. Now, we want to find out the value of 'c' which represents how many balls you are taking out and putting back in. So, here's what we're going to do: 1. Combine the number of balls taken out and put back in, like this: 536853*c - 268418*c - 268194*c 2. Now, simplify it to: (536853 - 268418 - 268194)*c 3. Do the math inside the parentheses: 536853 - 268418 - 268194 = 241 4. So, now it looks like this: 241*c = 13496 5. To find the value of 'c', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 241: c = 13496 / 241 6. When you do that division, you get: c = 56 So, our answer is c = 56.

Q:Information: - A parody religion or mock religion is a belief system that challenges spiritual convictions of others, often through humor, satire, or burlesque (literary ridicule). Often created to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of several religions, sects, gurus, cults, or new religious movements at the same time or even a parody of no particular religion, instead parodying the concept of religious belief itself. In some parody religions, emphasis is on having fun and being a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like-minded (e.g., the Church of the SubGenius). Other parody religions target a specific religion, sect, cult, or new religious movement. - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving. - Monotheism has been defined as the belief in the existence of only one god that created the world, is all-powerful and interferes in the world. Another, more broad definition of monotheism, is the belief in one god. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising various distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity. - Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society. It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature. Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position. He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe. The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples. - Omnipresence or ubiquity is the property of being present everywhere. This property is most commonly used in a religious context as an attribute of a deity or supreme being. - Ra (\\"R\\") or Re (\\"R\\") is the ancient Egyptian sun god. By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th centuries , he had become a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun. - In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the \\"attributes\\" of God. In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' \\"Enneads\\" as the Simplex. - Omniscience , mainly in religion, is the capacity to know everything that there is to know. In particular, Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism) and the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) believe that there is a divine being who is omniscient. An omniscient point-of-view, in writing, is to know everything that can be known about a character, including past history, thoughts, feelings, etc. In Latin, \\"omnis\\" means \\"all\\" and \\"science\\" means \\"knowing\\". - Omnipotence is the quality of having unlimited power. Monotheistic religions generally attribute omnipotence to only the deity of their faith. In the monotheistic philosophies of Abrahamic religions, omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including omniscience, omnipresence, and omnibenevolence. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable theological debate, prominently including the problem of theodicy, the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil. - Supreme Being is a term for God used by theologians and philosophers of many religious faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and deism. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - The Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, Jehovah 1, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient mythology and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs' followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources. - Jehovah 1 or JHVH - 1 ( also known as Woden , Ra , etc. ) is a God - like entity important in the mythology of the Church of the SubGenius , and the opposite number of the Satan - like entity NHGH . This \`\` wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy '' is considered to be identical with the God of the Abrahamic and most other patriarchal religions . According to SubGenius dogma , JHVH - 1 contacted J. R. \`\` Bob '' Dobbs in 1953 through a television set of Dobbs ' own construction . The many things told and shown to \`\` Bob '' during his Divine Emaculation were written down in the Prescriptures , the most sacred texts of SubGenius tradition , excerpts of which were publicized in the Book of the SubGenius . - Theism, in the field of comparative religion, or when contrasted with atheism, is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of a deity or deities. In popular parlance, or when contrasted with \\"deism\\", the term often describes the classical conception of god(s) that is found in the monotheistic and polytheistic religions; a belief in a god or in gods without the rejection of revelation as is characteristic of deism. - Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something which is easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \\"simplicity\\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. \\"Simplicity\\" may also occur with negative connotations to suggest a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required. - Noon (also midday or noon time) is usually defined as 12 o'clock in the daytime, that is, 12 in the afternoon or 12p.m. The term midday is also used colloquially to refer to an arbitrary period of time in the middle of the day. Solar noon is when the sun crosses the meridian and is at its highest elevation in the sky, at 12 o'clock apparent solar time. The local or clock time of solar noon depends on the longitude and date. The opposite of noon is midnight. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'jehovah 1'.

In addition to genetic factors, research has shown that certain metabolic alterations can also play significant roles in cancer initiation, growth, and spread. Here are four other key factors associated with cancer as a metabolic disorder: 1) Glutamine, 2) Insulin, 3) Glycation Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), and 4) Sugar Levels. 1. Glutamine: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the bloodstream and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, energy generation, and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Cancer cells often have an increased demand for glutamine, relying on it as a major fuel source to support rapid cell division. By consuming high amounts of glutamine, cancer cells can outcompete healthy cells for resources and proliferate further. Several therapies are in development to target glutamine metabolism to starve cancer cells of this essential nutrient, with the ultimate goal of slowing or stopping tumor growth. 2. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose metabolism, playing a pivotal role in maintaining blood sugar levels within normal parameters. Recent research has revealed a strong link between elevated insulin levels and cancer development. High insulin levels can promote cancer cell growth by increasing the availability of glucose and other nutrients in the bloodstream. Additionally, insulin can activate signaling pathways that lead to cell division, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. As a result, it may indirectly promote tumor progression. Therefore, understanding the relationship between insulin and cancer may lead to the development of new targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies in the future. 3. Glycation Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): AGEs are formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between sugar molecules and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids, leading to the formation of large, complex molecular structures. They accumulate within cells and tissues over time and are implicated in several age-related and lifestyle-related diseases, including cancer. AGEs can promote cancer development and progression through various mechanisms, including the activation of signaling pathways, the promotion of inflammation and oxidative stress, and the stimulation of angiogenesis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that some types of cancer cells have a higher sensitivity to AGEs, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. 4. Sugar Levels: High sugar consumption has been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly in those with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. Elevated blood sugar levels can contribute to cancer development through several mechanisms, including the stimulation of insulin secretion, the generation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the direct cellular damage caused by excessive glucose metabolism. In addition, high sugar levels can favor cancer cell proliferation by providing a constant source of energy. Therefore, maintaining a healthy diet low in sugar content and managing blood sugar levels through lifestyle modifications and medical interventions may help prevent the development and progression of cancer. In conclusion, understanding and exploring the connections between cancer as a metabolic disorder and these four key factors (glutamine, insulin, AGEs, and sugar levels) provides valuable insights into cancer initiation, progression, and potential therapeutic targets. Targeting metabolic processes and pathways associated with these factors may offer novel opportunities for cancer prevention and treatment, improving patient outcomes and reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vincent wanted to boil water for the spaghetti in a kettle instead of a pot because he thought the","completion":"water would heat up faster in the kettle. You see, a kettle is a special container that is used to heat water quickly, and it can heat water faster than a pot because it has a smaller opening at the top, which helps keep the heat inside. So, Vincent filled the kettle with water and turned on the heat. As the water started to get warm, it began to make a funny whistling sound. That's because kettles have a special part called a whistle that lets out a loud sound when the water inside is boiling and ready to be used. This helps people know when their water is hot and ready, just like an alarm clock helps us know when it's time to wake up. Once the kettle started whistling, Vincent knew the water was boiling and ready for the spaghetti. He carefully took the kettle off the stove and poured the hot water into a larger pot. Then, he added the long, thin spaghetti noodles into the pot, making sure they were covered by the hot water. Spaghetti is a type of pasta, and pasta comes from a country called Italy. Italian people love to eat pasta with different sauces and ingredients, like tomatoes, cheese, and even meatballs. Vincent wanted to have his spaghetti with a tomato sauce and some grated cheese on top- yum! As the spaghetti noodles cooked in the boiling water, they became soft and flexible. Vincent used a big fork to stir the noodles so they wouldn't stick together. Once the spaghetti was cooked just right, he carefully drained the water out of the pot, using a colander. A colander is like a big bowl with lots of tiny holes in it; it lets the water out but keeps the spaghetti inside. Now it was time to add the tomato sauce! Vincent poured the sauce over the warm spaghetti noodles and mixed it all together. He then grabbed a plate, put some spaghetti on it, and sprinkled some cheese on top. Vincent finally took a big bite of his delicious spaghetti dinner, feeling proud and happy that he was able to make it by using the kettle to heat the water. It just goes to show that sometimes, thinking creatively and trying new ways of doing things can lead to a yummy and satisfying result!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" Question: After the end of this story, Maloney is probably Options: A. not enough information B. chairing another committee C. still co-chair of the committee D. not chairing any committee === The correct answer is A:","completion":"not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day when he was a teenager, Eisenheim (played as young man by Aaron Johnson) meets a traveling magician (David Forest) along a road. The magician performs several tricks for him and then, according to various accounts, both the magician and the tree he was sitting under vanish. Eisenheim becomes obsessed with magic tricks after this.He also falls in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen (Biel, played as a young lady by Eleanor Tomlinson ), a noblewoman well above his social class; her parents have hired Eisenheim's father as a cabinetmaker. Young Eisenheim makes Young Sophie a unique marquetry puzzle locket, which if twisted correctly reveals a small, hidden photograph of Eisenheim. Although the two are forbidden to see each other, they meet in a secret hideout chamber in the woods, where Eisenheim tells of his plans to go to China to learn more magic and Sophie promises to go with him. On the day that they are going to leave, however, the police come looking for Sophie. The two hide in the secret room and Sophie begs Eisenheim to make them both disappear. He is unable to fulfill this request and the two are separated.Eisenheim leaves his village to travel the world; he perfects his magic and returns 15 years later as a master illusionist. He meets Sophie at one of his performances, when she is volunteered by the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold as a reluctant participant in a trick.

Eisenheim and Sophie, having recognized each other, meet privately, whereupon it is revealed that Sophie still has the locket he made for her years ago. After... Answer:","completion":"Considering the detailed plot summary provided for the movie, a comprehensive and thought-provoking question to ask would be: How does Eisenheim's journey from a humble cabinetmaker's son to a master illusionist, and his enduring love for Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, not only challenge and change the societal norms and beliefs of their time, but also how does it ultimately expose and break the cycle of power and abuse exerted by Crown Prince Leopold, eventually allowing Eisenheim and Sophie to shape their destinies? This question brings together various elements of the plot, such as Eisenheim's dedication to honing his magical skills, his relationship with Sophie that transcends social class boundaries, and their struggle against the oppressive force represented by Crown Prince Leopold. Additionally, it invites an analysis of the characters’ motivations, the impact of their choices and actions, and the transformative potential of love and determination in the face of adversity.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Q: run around right thrice A:","completion":"To break down the command \\"run around right thrice\\", we'll first identify the key words and then translate them into actions based on the definition provided: 1. \\"run\\" - corresponds to the action 'I_RUN'. 2. \\"around\\" - means to execute the action while turning around in the specified direction. 3. \\"right\\" - indicates the direction for the \\"around\\" command, which means turning right. 4. \\"thrice\\" - indicates the command sequence should be repeated three times. Knowing this information, we can construct the sequence of actions: 1. 'I_RUN' - perform the running action. 2. 'I_TURN_RIGHT' - since we need to \\"run around right\\", we start by turning right. 3. 'I_RUN' - continue running after turning. 4. 'I_TURN_RIGHT' - turning right again to complete the around right movement. 5. 'I_RUN' - continue running after completing the around right movement. Now, we need to repeat this sequence thrice: 1. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (first repetition) 2. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (second repetition) 3. 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN' (third repetition) Combining these sequences gives us the final output: 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN', 'I_TURN_RIGHT', 'I_RUN'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process In the given process, it primarily describes the respiratory system and how air is taken in, oxygen is exchanged, and carbon dioxide is exhaled. When considering the scenario of \\"more reservations made\\" happening, we can assume this refers to an increase in physical or mental activities that require more energy and oxygen consumption. When more reservations are made, it means that there is an increased demand for oxygen by the body to support the additional activities. As a result, the body will likely increase the rate of respiration to accommodate this higher demand for oxygen, leading to more air being taken in via the nose or mouth. This increase in the rate of respiration and air intake is an indirect effect on the process, as it is not directly modifying a specific step in the process. However, it is still impacting the process by altering the overall respiratory rate to meet the body's increased demand for oxygen. In summary, the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. The increased demand for oxygen due to more reservations made will cause the body to adjust its respiratory rate and increase the amount of air taken in through the nose or mouth, which indirectly affects the overall respiratory process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child. Robert does not have the heart to put down the baby, and gives the task to Will. Unwilling to do so, he decides to... The answer is:","completion":"Can't answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? Options: - not enough information - that the agreement will definitely be broken at some point - probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations - that the agreement will not likely bear meaningful results === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un marked an unprecedented meeting between the two nations. Following the summit, both leaders signed a broad declaration aiming to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long-standing hostilities between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement \\"very comprehensive.\\" Given the positive outcome of the summit and the historic nature of the meeting, it is likely that Trump believes North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. This belief may be further bolstered by the fact that North Korea pivoted to diplomacy after successfully testing missiles that it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States. Additionally, North Korea suspended further provocations and indicated a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. It is important to note, however, that some skepticism still exists among South Koreans and others. This is due to North Korea's history of not keeping its promises in the past, even after signing agreements. While there are differing opinions on the likelihood of success for the new agreement, it is probable that Trump believes that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How do you do this: How do you remove red wine stains from furniture?","completion":"To remove red wine stains from furniture, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Act Quickly Red wine stains are easier to remove when they are fresh. As soon as you notice the spill, act quickly to minimize the chance of the stain setting in. Step 2: Blot the Stain Using a clean, white cloth or paper towel, gently blot the stain to absorb as much liquid as possible. Do not rub the stain, as this can cause it to spread or settle deeper into the fibers. Step 3: Mix a Cleaning Solution Create a cleaning solution by mixing two cups of cool water with one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Alternatively, you can use white vinegar instead of dish soap, which can help neutralize the stain more effectively. Step 4: Test the Solution Before applying the cleaning solution to the stain, test it on an inconspicuous area of the furniture to ensure it won't damage or discolor the fabric. Step 5: Apply the Cleaning Solution Dip a clean, white cloth into the cleaning solution and gently blot the stain until it becomes damp. Avoid soaking the fabric as this can cause damage to the furniture. Step 6: Blot with a Clean Cloth Using another clean, white cloth, gently blot the stained area to lift away the stain. Repeat this process, alternating between the cleaning solution and a clean cloth until the stain is no longer visible. Step 7: Rinse the Area Using a new cloth dampened with cold water, gently blot the area to rinse away any soap residue. Step 8: Dry the Area Gently press a clean, dry cloth or paper towel against the area to absorb excess moisture. Allow the fabric to air dry completely. Remember that some fabrics and stains may be more difficult to remove than others, and professional cleaning may be necessary if the stain persists. Always consult the care instructions for your specific furniture to ensure you are using the appropriate cleaning method."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:At the European Respiratory Society conference, researchers will suggest this could be due to an absence of protective fatty acids in yoghurt. The diets of more than 70,000 Danish women were analysed and their children followed until the age of seven. Asthma UK says pregnant women should follow a balanced diet. Pregnant women who ate low-fat yoghurt with fruit once a day were found to be 1.6 times more likely to have children who developed asthma by age seven, compared with children of women who did not eat low-fat yoghurt. The study also found that the children of these women were more likely to have allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and current asthma symptoms. But the results showed that milk intake during pregnancy was not linked to any increased risk of asthma. In fact, milk was shown to protect against asthma development. Ekaterina Maslova, lead study author form the Harvard School of Public Health, who worked with the data at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, said: \\"It is a puzzling finding.

This field is generated by the movement of molten iron within the Earth's core. The Earth's magnetic field has two poles: the magnetic north pole and the magnetic south pole. Step 1: Understanding the compass A compass is an instrument containing a small magnet (the needle) that is free to pivot and align itself with the Earth's magnetic field. One end of the needle is typically painted red or marked with an \\"N\\" to indicate the north-seeking end. Step 2: Align the compass When you hold the compass horizontally and allow the needle to move freely, it will line up with the Earth's magnetic field lines, with the north-seeking end of the needle pointing toward the magnetic north pole. Step 3: Magnetic declination It is important to note that the Earth's magnetic north pole is not exactly the same as the geographic north pole. The angle between the magnetic north and true north is called magnetic declination, and it can vary depending on your location on Earth. To obtain the true north direction requires adjusting for the local magnetic declination. So, when the needle of a compass lines up with Earth's magnetic poles, the needle points towards the magnetic north pole and is aligned with the Earth's magnetic field lines. In summary, when the needle of a compass lines up with Earth's magnetic poles, the needle is: 1. Aligned with the Earth's magnetic field lines. 2. Pointing toward the magnetic north pole. 3. Indicating the magnetic north direction, which may differ from the true north depending on the local magnetic declination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Trust me I'm a doctor: the case of the rogue spinal surgeon It didn’t take long for Richard Kaul’s spine surgery practice in the middle-class New Jersey suburb of Pompton Lakes to turn a profit. The Indian-born, British-raised doctor had been performing procedures in small surgeries for a number of years before he opened his own place in 2011. By 2012, he owned a 2m home in New Jersey, a Manhattan penthouse and an 8.3m brownstone on New York’s Upper West Side, which boasted a soundproof media room, three terraces and nine fireplaces. Kaul’s website attributed his success to his brilliance as a surgeon. He had, it said, “long been lauded as a pioneer in minimally invasive spine surgery” and had “performed the first outpatient spinal fusion in New Jersey”. His medical training was “as extensive as it is impressive”: he had graduated from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London in 1988 and trained in both the UK and US. It was armed with this information, and desperate for help, that James Jarrell first visited Kaul. He had experienced sporadic back pain for more than 20 years – half his working life had been spent in the drilling and blasting industry. For a year, he’d received cortisone shots, spinal manipulation and anaesthesia from a chiropractor, but eventually, on 5 September 2005, he was referred to Kaul. Kaul told him he would perform minimally invasive spinal surgery – he’d “make a cut down in the side and… put two very small holes where they can work through some tubes,” Jarrell later recalled in court – and that he’d be back at work within two weeks. Kaul performed a discogram, injecting dye into the spinal discs to pinpoint the cause of the pain; a discectomy, removing disc material that was pressing on the nerves or spinal cord; a lumbar interbody fusion, in which two mesh cages were implanted between the spinal discs; and the insertion of pedicle screws – bone screws used to secure rods and plates to support the spine. When he awoke in the recovery room, Jarrell’s right side felt better, but his left side was in agony: “I remember touching and complaining about my left leg which had never bothered me before.” He had difficulty moving it, and walking on it hurt. When he got the x-rays back, Jarrell was told to return to the doctor immediately. “They would not tell me what was wrong. I remember thinking, am I crippled? I was very upset. I was scared.” Jarrell went back to see Kaul. “He just flipped the x-rays up to the light and said, ‘Oh, we can fix this: I just go up in there and scrape a little stuff out, and you’ll be fine.’ And I said no, no, no. No, you’re not touching me.” A different doctor prescribed oxycodone and fentanyl patches for the pain. Jarrell was forced to wear a back and foot brace, but by March 2007 the pain was worsening and he developed depression. He sought treatment from a neurosurgeon who found that the implant material Kaul had installed was pinching a nerve; he also thought the screws had been misplaced. Jarrell underwent further surgery, after which he said he felt much better, but his ability to walk had been impaired. Jarrell sued Kaul and his practice for medical malpractice – his wife Sheila claimed she had lost her husband’s “companionship, consortium and services”, while Jarrell claimed he was left unable to walk properly or work because of the pain. The jury found that Kaul had deviated from the applicable standard of care and awarded Jarrell 500,000 for “pain, suffering, disability and the loss of the enjoyment of life” and 187,890 for medical expenses; Sheila got 250,000. But it transpired that Jarrell wasn’t alone: he was one of 11 patients who claim to have been left injured after being operated on by Kaul. One, Patricia Maze, accused him of leaving her disabled after surgery on her lower back in 2008. Her attorney said Kaul attempted to perform a spinal fusion and that the result was permanent damage to her spine, which left her wheelchair-bound and in a “living hell”. Kaul settled with Maze in March for a reported 450,000, just before her case went to trial. Kaul was found to have been grossly negligent and incompetent in those 11 cases; it also turned out that he wasn’t a qualified spine surgeon at all – he was a doctor, yes, but an anaesthetist. Worse than that, he had a conviction for manslaughter in the UK. In 2001, a dental patient Kaul had anaesthetised died during routine treatment, and Kaul received a suspended prison sentence. He had neglected to tell the New Jersey medical board this – something he was required to do when he renewed his licence there, having been banned from practising medicine in Britain. I wanted to know what Kaul was doing now. Was he remorseful? Did he accept the court and medical board’s findings – and would he talk to me? Born in Hyderabad in southern India, Richard Kaul moved to the UK when he was two and the family settled in Kent. He graduated from London’s Royal Free hospital in 1988 and worked there and at the Lister hospital in Chelsea, before moving to the US in the 90s. After a handful of surgical internships in New York, Kaul began a three-year fellowship in anaesthesia in New Jersey, and was board certified by the American Medical Association in 1996. Visa restrictions meant he had to return to the UK for two years, where he undertook a one-year fellowship in pain management at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He applied to the Royal College of Surgeons to get his American certification recognised in Britain, but it ruled that he would have to train for a further 18 months in a British hospital – a decision Kaul challenged but one that was upheld on appeal. Instead, with financial help from his brother, he purchased a dental clinic in Dalston, east London. In March 1999, Isatu Bangura, 56, came in for a routine tooth extraction and two fillings, but the mother of six was anxious and asked for a general anaesthetic. Kaul gave her the sedative midazolam and the analgesic fentanyl. When the dentist began, Kaul later recalled, it became evident Bangura could still feel pain, so he gave her a dose of the barbiturate methohexital. What happened next formed the basis of a court case at the Old Bailey in which Kaul answered a charge of manslaughter: Bangura’s heart stopped during the dental procedure and she died six days later. The court heard that a receptionist had acted as an unqualified dental nurse; she testified that Kaul had asked her to switch off an alarm monitoring Bangura’s blood pressure and oxygen level because the noise annoyed him. She also said he was looking out of the window and talking on his phone when she noticed Bangura wasn’t breathing – claims Kaul denied. William Boyce, prosecuting, said Kaul used “back door” methods not approved by the General Dental Council; that he administered anaesthetic too quickly or in too great a quantity. Kaul failed to call an ambulance for 30 minutes after Bangura stopped breathing, Boyce said, and refused to accompany her to hospital. In an 11-1 majority verdict, Kaul was found guilty and given a six-month suspended prison sentence. But Kaul still had his US anaesthesia accreditation and had no intention of quitting. He sent off an application form to renew his medical licence, on which he was asked if he’d ever been charged with a crime, or if his licence had ever been suspended. Kaul ticked no to both – a move he would later say he made because he believed it referred to crimes in the US, not the UK. It would be another year before the General Medical Council struck Kaul off its register, so for the time being he was still licensed to practise in the UK. He embarked on a business venture with his brother, Peter, taking telephone consultations from patients experiencing impotence issues and dispensing Viagra – then a new “wonder drug”. When Kaul moved back to the US in September 2001, Peter, who was not a doctor, continued to operate the business. Shortly after, officers from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency – the body responsible for ensuring the safety of medicines in the UK – raided the company’s offices and seized their computers. In New York, Kaul was visited by agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration and later received a summons to appear at court in London; but he told his brother that unless they extradited him, he was not returning. Peter was fined £200,000. Kaul claims he paid most of that sum himself – but that when the final court date arrived, the judge sent his brother to prison for a year – the amount hadn’t been paid in full. News of Kaul’s conviction for manslaughter and of the GMC hearing finally crossed the pond, and in 2002 he was told the New Jersey medical board intended to revoke his licence. It took a year for his licence hearing to come to court. Kaul argued that if Bangura’s death had happened in the US, it would have resulted in a malpractice suit, not a charge of manslaughter. But the board fined him 10,000 and suspended his licence for six months. Kaul later wrote that he wanted to use this time to acquire skills in minimally invasive spine surgery which he could see was a developing field. He travelled to South Korea to attend a two-week spine surgery course. When he returned to New York, with his medical licence reinstated, he worked in pain management treatment centres and began performing spinal surgery on patients. Maze and Jarrell were among 11 whose testimony was taken into consideration by the New Jersey state attorney general after a complaint was filed with the board of medical examiners. Their findings were damning. Kaul had performed spine surgeries for which he was not qualified, the report said: “There was nothing in his education or training that provided him with the experience necessary to perform spinal surgeries. In fact, the first time he ever inserted a pedicle screw on a live patient was at a surgery centre when he was on his own. There was no one to monitor the surgery or assess his skill level.” For claiming he was a minimally invasive spine specialist, and telling patients he had the skills to perform those surgeries, the report said he “engaged in dishonesty, fraud, deception [and] misrepresentation”. He also failed to maintain medical malpractice insurance. In March this year, the board revoked Kaul’s licence and fined him 300,000, ordering him to pay the state’s expenses of 174,000. But Kaul refused to accept this. He launched an audacious PR campaign, including a billboard in Times Square and a YouTube channel – the first video, entitled Exposing Lies, dealt with what he said was the inaccuracy of press coverage he had received. He set up a Facebook page, on which he posted videos of patients claiming he’d been unfairly treated, and issued press releases on behalf of the Society for Advanced Spine Intervention, an organisation he had started. So who exactly is Richard Kaul? One clue is his ghostwritten autobiography, self-published earlier this year, called Arjun Rising. The book begins with a potted history of India’s struggle for independence, into which Kaul weaves his family history. He says he feels “spiritually connected” to an Indian prince called Arjuna, who features in some ancient Sanskrit texts and from whom Kaul gets his middle name. It’s a curious mix of self-aggrandisement and bizarre confessions: “Every year, up until 18, I ranked number one academically and I constantly won the award for best sportsman of the year”; “Once [as a toddler] when I was trying to make a statement, I took my nappy off and released my entire bowel in the middle of the living room floor.” Then there are lengthy sections that deal, in graphic detail, with Kaul’s sexual exploits. There’s the tally he kept at medical school “to see how many nurses we could have sex with over the years” and the time he “met this stunning girl from Athens and had great raw sex with her”. He also writes of his mother’s death from lung and skin cancer at the age of 43, how this affected him, and how he became addicted to recreational and prescription drugs, and spent periods in rehab. One line stayed with me: “The internal makeup of doctors is generally described as egocentric… [there’s] a cliff of expectations, ambitions and goals that they’re invincible and they will save the world.” Although he responds to my email fairly quickly, Kaul says he’s going to be out of the country, and we don’t meet until two months later. His office is on the ground floor of a nondescript building in a New Jersey suburb. He greets me at the door, smiling, wearing a black V-neck sweater and glasses. The office space he rents is empty save for some cardboard boxes and piles of paperwork: Kaul says that because he can no longer practise medicine, he’s not renewing the lease. We sit in an empty boardroom at a large wooden table. Kaul is disarmingly polite as he leads me through what he sees as the saga of his life. His girlfriend sits with us throughout. It all began, he says, with the death of Isatu Bangura. He insists his former receptionist was lying about him being on his mobile phone while Bangura stopped breathing in the dentist’s chair. “Having experienced the loss of my mother, I understood very well what her family were going through and at the end of the trial. I wanted to apologise to them. But they weren’t ready to accept the apology.” Has he apologised to them since? “No, I haven’t. And that’s something that has always stuck with me.” Kaul insists he was trained sufficiently to carry out the spinal procedures, and that they formed part of his anaesthesia training. “I have done thousands of cases,” he says, “and the evolution from interventional pain management into minimally invasive spine surgery is a very logical, natural one.” He says there is no recognised fellowship in minimally invasive spine surgery. “So when a doctor wants to get training, he goes and undertakes the same types of courses I had undertaken since 2002. There were no standards; there wasn’t one specific qualification or programme, and there still isn’t.” He says he performed “800 of these minimally invasive spinal procedures” and that out of those, only 11 people complained. (Later on, I speak to Dr Russell Nelson, founder and medical director of the Nelson Spine Institute in California and a spine surgeon for 30 years. Nelson tells me that someone trained in anaesthesia is not trained in spinal anatomy. There are two ways to become a spine surgeon in the US: you either train in orthopaedics or neurosurgery – both of which would usually be followed by a year-long spine fellowship taught by expert physicians. Doctors would then have to keep up with the latest developments via courses throughout their careers.) But Kaul believes New Jersey governor Chris Christie was given money by a small group of surgeons in return for asking the state’s medical board to take action against him, because he was operating on their turf. He insists he’s the victim of a “corrupt system” – that powerful interests came after him because “I was building a successful practice and moving medicine forward in a way that entrenched interests didn’t want.” Kaul tells me that patients found out about him on the internet because of the press the Bangura case received, and brought it up during their consultations with him. It got to the point, he says, that he couldn’t ignore it, so he came up with the idea for the autobiography to “set the record straight. I still feel I did nothing wrong. You know, when they first started this nonsense, if I had packed my bags and run away, I think that would have communicated to people that I was trying to hide something; that I was guilty of something. But that’s not the case.” While he is candid and friendly during our meeting, Kaul’s answers seem self-serving, unremorseful, or both. I wonder if his unwillingness to admit he was wrong and his subsequent PR campaign and book are the hallmarks of a narcissist.“Yeah, there will be people who’ll say that,” he says. “But I don’t think so. I did a lot of charity work here and treated a lot of patients who had no medical insurance, and I did that for free. I took my own money and used that to set up the Spine Africa Project, to do something positive where people had no healthcare.” Kaul set up his charity in 2008 to offer treatment to people across the continent suffering from degenerative spine injuries and deformities. Now that he’s closing his private practice in New Jersey, he says, he’ll channel all his efforts into that. On the Spine Africa website, the charity promises to train local doctors, improve facilities and raise awareness; it will also be treating people afflicted with spinal conditions. There’s a video documentary, too, that shows Kaul visiting the Panzi hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2011. He meets the hospital’s director and various patients. At the end, accompanied by uplifting music, Kaul operates on a boy with a spinal condition. “We’re all very excited for him,” he says as he removes the dressing covering the boy’s back. “He seems to be making progress in the right direction here.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Richard Kaul was a doctor who claimed to be an expert spinal surgeon, but he actually wasn't qualified for that. Many patients experienced pain and problems after he operated on them, and after realizing that he was not qualified to do those surgeries, some of them sued him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Establish initial impressions From the very beginning, the film's lack of cohesive storytelling and character development fails to draw the viewer in, quickly unraveling any potential intrigue. As the plot progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to remain invested in the story or care about its one-dimensional characters. Step 2: Address the film's acting and dialogue The acting, unfortunately, does little to alleviate the lackluster narrative. Wooden performances and stilted dialogue create a sense of disconnect between the audience and the onscreen events. It doesn't help that the script often devolves into clichés and tired tropes, weighing down the actors' efforts. Step 3: Analyze the film's visuals and special effects From a visual standpoint, \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" offers nothing extraordinary or memorable. The special effects, while competently executed, struggle to hide the film's low budget, ultimately detracting from the overall experience. Step 4: Assess the pacing and editing Pacing remains a consistent issue throughout the film, with scenes often dragging on longer than necessary and critical plot points feeling rushed or underexplored. In addition, the editing does little to remedy the disjointed nature of the storytelling, leading to an overall sense of confusion and disorientation. Step 5: Evaluate the film's conclusion \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" limps towards its conclusion, offering little in the way of satisfying resolution or emotional payoff. Instead, the film's climax leaves viewers with more questions than answers and a profound sense of disappointment. Step 6: Concluding thoughts In summary, \\"The Timeless Dilemma\\" is a film best avoided, marred by a weak script, uninspired acting, and lackluster visuals. Unfortunately, this film's disappointing execution outweighs any potential it might have had, resulting in a forgettable and unsatisfying experience for audiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there's a simple way to elevate your apple-eating experience: washing and chilling them. In this article, we will walk you through the steps to properly prepare apples for an even more enjoyable and rejuvenating treat. Step 1: Washing the Apples Washing apples is essential, as it helps get rid of any dirt, pesticides, and bacteria that may be on their surface as well as any wax that can be present in store-bought apples. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Fill a large bowl or basin with water and a small amount of vinegar – about 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water should do. 2. Place the apples in the solution and allow them to soak for a few minutes. 3. Using your hands or a soft cloth, gently scrub the apples under the solution to remove any dirt, pesticides, and wax. 4. Rinse the apples with clean water to remove any residue from the vinegar solution. Step 2: Removing the Stems Removing the stems from apples not only enhances their appearance, but also makes them more convenient to eat. Moreover, pulling the stem out can help prevent any accidental swallowing of the stem. To do this, grasp the stem between your thumb and index finger, and gently twist and pull until it comes out. Step 3: Refrigerating the Apples Now that your apples are clean and stem-free, it's time to chill them. Chilled apples offer a more refreshing taste, making them even more enjoyable during the hot summer months. 1. Arrange the apples on a tray or plate, making sure there's enough space between each so they don't touch. 2. Place the tray or plate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. 3.

Here are possible answers to this question: - carried by people - guard house - fly - follow ultralight airplane - group together I believe the correct choice is \\"fly\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Geese primarily get from place to place by flying, which makes \\"fly\\" the correct choice among the given options. Geese are highly efficient migratory birds with strong wings that enable them to fly long distances with minimal effort. Here's a detailed explanation of why flying is the primary mode of transportation for geese, and a brief overview of the alternative options provided: 1. Flying: Geese rely on their impressive ability to fly as their primary means of getting from place to place. They are known for their distinguishing V-shaped flight formation, which helps reduce drag and conserve energy by taking advantage of the upwash currents created by the wingtips of the bird in front of them. This formation is particularly useful during migration, where geese fly thousands of miles to reach their nesting or wintering grounds. The wings of geese are designed for long-duration, energy-efficient flying, allowing them to cover great distances with minimal stops. 2. Carried by people: Although geese can be carried by people, this is not a usual mode of transportation for them. They are wild animals capable of moving independently, and humans would only carry them in exceptional circumstances, such as rescuing an injured bird or transporting a domesticated goose. It is neither practical nor advisable for humans to carry geese as a standard method of transport. 3. Guard House: The term \\"guardhouse\\" refers to a building or structure used to house security personnel or serve as a detention facility. This option is not relevant to the question of how geese travel from one place to another, as it does not pertain to the movement or transportation of birds. 4. Follow ultralight airplane: It's true that there have been instances where geese were trained to follow ultralight airplanes for the purpose of studying migration or reintroducing young birds to a migratory route. However, this method is not employed for geese under normal circumstances and is a form of human intervention primarily applied in research or conservation efforts. Flying independently, as mentioned earlier, is the natural and standard mode of transportation for geese. 5. Group together: While geese do group together, this action by itself doesn't describe their mode of transportation. Geese are social birds, and they group together for various reasons, such as communication, protection, and resource-sharing. A flock of geese shares the benefits of cooperation during migration or while searching for food and resting spots. However, the act of grouping together does not explain how geese move from one place to another. In conclusion, geese primarily travel from place to place by flying. Their strong wings, V-shaped flight formation, and inclination for grouping together make them efficient travelers, especially during long-distance migrations. The other options provided are either unrelated or pertain to exceptional cases involving human intervention, making \\"fly\\" the most accurate and logical choice in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The user mentioned a specific dish - \\"chiliquiles with eggs,\\" but didn't explicitly state any negative or positive aspect about it. However, the context in which the dish is mentioned is linked with the word \\"Yum\\", which again suggests a positive sentiment. 3. The review doesn't contain any obvious negative words or phrases (e.g., not good, poor, bad, etc.), which generally indicate a negative review. Hence, based on my analysis, I'd categorize the given review as positive. However, it should be noted that this is a basic analysis, and human sentiment can sometimes be complex and harder to decipher from a short statement."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Hans Kristian Rausing, one of the heirs to to the multibillion pound Tetra Pak packaging dynasty, has been arrested in connection with the death of his wife Eva, after her body was found at their luxurious west London home. The Metropolitan police said a body had been found at an address in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, one of the most exclusive streets in London. The property had been searched following the earlier arrest in south London of a 49-year-old man on suspicion of possession of drugs, a spokesman said. The man was later rearrested in connection with the death, which is being treated as \\"unexplained\\". He is being held at a station in south London. Though Scotland Yard has not yet confirmed his identity, the 49-year-old is understood to be Rausing, whose Swedish grandfather Ruben Rausing invented the Tetra Laval milk carton in the 1960s. His father Hans senior was ranked by Forbes in 2010 as the 64th richest man in the world. A post mortem was opened at 1pm on Monday at Westminster mortuary. The dead woman has not yet been formally identified, but sources confirmed the body was that of Mrs Rausing. The five storey terraced house is in one of London's most expensive areas just off Sloane Street, between Knightsbridge and Chelsea. Officers could be seen guarding the front door last night, which was taped off. The couple, who have four teenage children, have struggled for many years with addiction to hard drugs, narrowly escaping prison in 2008 after heroin and £2,000 worth of crack cocaine were found at their home. Mrs Rausing had been arrested after trying to smuggle several wraps of cocaine into a reception at the American embassy in Grosvenor Square. As part of their caution, the couple were required to attend a four-month drugs rehabilitation programme, and they were prominent benefactors of a number of anti-drugs charities, even while they continued to struggle with their own addictions. The American-born Mrs Rausing, the daughter of a wealthy Pepsi executive, met her husband in the 1980s when they were both being treated at a US drug rehabilitation centre. In a statement following her arrest in 2008, she said: \\"I have made a serious mistake which I very much regret,\\" she said. \\"I intend to leave as soon as possible to seek the help that I very much need. I have made a grave error and I consider myself to have taken a wrong turn in the course of my life. I am very sorry for the upset I have caused. I thank my family and friends for their kindness and understanding.\\" After the hearing, the Rausing family said they \\"hope[d] with all their hearts\\" that the couple could \\"overcome their addiction\\", and that they would support them. But the decision to drop charges in favour of a conditional caution attracted some criticism of double standards for wealthy offenders, and was described as \\"very surprising\\" by the then Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair who said it \\"sends entirely the wrong message about drug use and disregards the harm it does to communities.\\" He added that the decision not to prosecute \\"reminds me of the 19th-century legal comment often attributed to Sir James Mathew: 'In England justice is open to all - just like the Ritz.'\\" Though he was born into relatively modest middle-class circumstances in Sweden, Hans Kristian Rausing's life was transformed by the vast wealth generated by his grandfather's packaging invention, which permitted milk to be kept fresh without the need for refrigeration. His father Hans Sr moved the family to Britain in the 1980s to avoid Sweden's higher tax regime, and in 1996 sold his half of the Tetra Pak company to his now late brother Gad for almost £5bn. The company is now controlled by Gad's three children, Jorn, Finn and Kirsten, who remain based in Sweden. Hans Sr, now in his 80s, lives in a 900-acre East Sussex estate, where he raises deer and collects vintage cars and is thought to have a personal fortune worth almost £6bn. Hans Kristian has two sisters, the older of whom, Lisbet, studied at Berkeley and Harvard and went on to be a research fellow at Imperial College. Sigrid Rausing, his other sister, owns the literary magazine Granta and the publishing firm Portobello books, and is a noted philanthropist. In an interview in 2004, she said great wealth was something that was not always easy to come to terms with: \\"Be open about it and be active with it.\\" She has said that her philanthropic habit developed partly from guilt, \\"but I think it was probably shame, if I can make that distinction. People knew you had money, so you could never say, 'Come back next month.'\\" Eva and Hans Kristian Rausing were also philanthropists, supporting, among others, charities working in the arts, sport and anti-addiction charities. Mrs Rausing was even a patron of one charity, The Mentor Foundation, which worked to help people out of addiction and also boasts the Queen of Sweden, Queen Noor of Jordan and Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia as honorary trustees. Prince Charles, with whom Hans K Rausing is said to be on first name terms, has described him as \\"a very special philanthropist\\" because of his support for drugs charities. ||||| One of Britain's richest women, American-born Eva Rausing, was found dead in her west London home and a man was arrested in connection with the case, British police said, adding that an autopsy had failed to uncover a formal cause of death.

(Associated Press) This photo taken from PA video shows police outside a house in Cadogan Place, Chelsea after the body of Eva Rausing, a member of the family behind the Tetra-Pak drinks carton empire and one of the richest... (Associated Press) Rausing, 48, was the wife of Hans Kristian Rausing, heir to the TetraPak fortune his father built by creating a successful manufacturer of laminated cardboard drink containers. Both Rausing and her husband had long-running and often public battles against addiction, including her arrest in 2008 for reportedly trying to bring drugs into the U.S. Embassy in London. British police said Tuesday they had arrested a 49-year-old man Monday on suspicion of drug possession and a subsequent search of an address in London's tony Belgravia neighborhood related to that arrest turned up Rausing's body later that day. The man was widely named in the British media but police would not confirm his identity. Scotland Yard said in a statement Tuesday that further tests were being carried out on Rausing's body after an autopsy was inconclusive. It said officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime division were investigating \\"and the death continues to be treated at this time as unexplained.\\" The man arrested in connection with Rausing's death remained under arrest but was receiving medical attention at a location away from the police station, police said. They would not say if the man was under guard. After the news broke, Eva Rausing's parents, Tom and Nancy Kemeny, and the rest of her family paid tribute to a \\"devoted wife\\" and mother of four \\"much loved and wonderful children,\\" saying they were devastated over her death. Their statement also alluded to her struggles. \\"During her short lifetime she made a huge philanthropic impact, supporting a large number of charitable causes, not only financially, but using her own personal experiences,\\" the family said in a statement. \\"She bravely fought her health issues for many years.\\" A statement from her in-laws, Hans and Marit Rausing, said they were \\"deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death.\\" Eva Rausing supported a number of charities that helped to fight addictions. One of them _ Action on Addiction _ was among the first to express sadness over her death and praise her \\"wonderfully generous\\" support over the years. She also was listed as a long-time supporter of The Prince's Foundation, part of a group of nonprofit charities that have Prince Charles as their patron. His office said the prince was told of Rausing's death but did not offer further comment. In a diplomatic scandal in 2008, Eva Rausing was arrested outside the U.S. Embassy in for reportedly trying to bring crack cocaine and heroin into building in her handbag. Police later found small amounts of cocaine, crack and heroin in a search of the couple's 5 million-pound (then 10 million) London town house. The couple was charged with drug possession but prosecutors later agreed to drop the charges in exchange for formal police warnings. At the time, the Rausing family issued a statement saying relatives were \\"deeply saddened\\" by the couple's drug problems and hoped they could overcome their addictions. Hans Rausing's Swedish father helped transform TetraPak into a hugely successful manufacturer. The fortune of the senior Rausing and his family is estimated at 4.3 billion pounds (6.7 billion) by the Sunday Times Rich List. ___ Cassandra Vinograd can be reached at http://twitter.com/CassVinograd ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Hans Kristian Rausing, an heir to the Tetra Pak packaging dynasty, has been arrested in connection with the death of his wife, Eva Rausing, whose body was found at their luxurious west London home.

Tässä lauseessa mainittu seitsemän vuoden ajanjakso viittaa siihen, että Belgian hallituksella ei ole mahdollisuutta toimia Euroopan unionin neuvoston puheenjohtajana seuraavien seitsemän vuoden aikana. Euroopan unionissa jäsenvaltioiden hallitusten puheenjohtajuus kiertää puolen vuoden välein, mikä tarkoittaa, että jokaisella jäsenvaltiolla on teoriassa mahdollisuus toimia neuvoston puheenjohtajana kahden ja puolen vuoden välein. Käytännössä kuitenkin monet muutkin asiat vaikuttavat puheenjohtajuuskausiin, kuten erilaisten prioriteettien huomiointi ja maiden välinen yhteistyö. Belgialle tämä tarkoittaa, että seuraavan kerran sen hallituksen mahdollisuus toimia neuvoston puheenjohtajana koittaa useiden vuosien päästä. Tänä aikana Belgian hallituksen on kuitenkin tärkeää jatkaa aktiivisena osallistujana Euroopan unionin päätöksentekoprosesseissa sekä pyrkiä vaikuttamaan unionin päätöksiin omien kantojensa ja etujensa mukaan. Belgialla on toki eurooppalaisen yhteistyön näkökulmasta suuri merkitys sen historiallisten saavutusten ja keskeisen sijainnin ansiosta Euroopassa.

Vaikka Belgian hallitus ei ole neuvoston puheenjohtaja seuraavan seitsemän vuoden aikana, sillä on edelleen tärkeä rooli Euroopan unionin sisällä.

A family desperate for answers has turned to the Internet to find out why their 10-month-old son can’t open his mouth. Baby Wyatt’s lockjaw has baffled doctors since he was born, and although the Scott family has taken him to every specialist imaginable, they can’t figure out the root of the problem, Andrew Scott, the baby's father, told ABCNews.com. So his wife, Amy, decided to create a website, WhatsWrongWithWyatt.com, in the hopes that someone will recognize the condition and offer a solution. \\"Nobody that we’ve found has seen anything like this before,” Andrew Scott told ABCNews.com. “Hopefully, somebody will see it and will have some ideas on how we should go forward.\\" Courtesy Andrew Scott When Wyatt was born last June in Ottawa, Canada, doctors were immediately alarmed that he couldn’t open his mouth -- fearing he could not breathe and would need to be intubated, according to the Scotts’ blog. He spent the next three months in the hospital. Since then, they have needed to call 911 six times because Wyatt was choking and unable to open his mouth, Andrew Scott said. Once, they needed to administer CPR, and another time, a bloody nose spilled out of his mouth and scared them all. Wyatt's doctor, Dr. J. P. Vaccani, said the condition, congenital trismus, is rare and usually the result of a fused joint or extra band of tissue. But Wyatt’s CT and MRI scans appear to be normal. \\"It's an unusual situation where he can’t open his mouth, and there’s no kind of obvious reason for it,” Vaccani, a pediatric otolaryngologist at Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario told ABCNews.com. “Otherwise, he’s a healthy boy.\\" Courtesy Andrew Scott Vaccani said it’s possible there’s a muscle problem, but to find out, doctors will need to put Wyatt to sleep and do a muscle biopsy. Unfortunately, anesthesiologists aren’t comfortable doing that just yet because they won’t be able to control his airways if they can’t open his mouth. Like most babies, Wyatt has trouble controlling his secretions, such as saliva, Vaccani said. But normal babies can open their mouths when they become too full as a kind of fail-safe, he said. Wyatt can’t do that, which is why he chokes. Courtesy Andrew Scott Since the Scotts’ daughter started kindergarten, she’s been bringing home extra bugs and viruses, making it even tougher on Wyatt who gets sick and chokes. “My daughter has an Elmo doll with band-aids on it. She treats him like her sick baby, too,” Andrew Scott said. “They’re pretty loving with him and everything.” Courtesy Andrew Scott Doctors have used Botox to relax Wyatt’s jaw muscles, allowing him to open his mouth a little bit, but it’s not a complete solution, Andrew Scott said.

First, we need to combine the terms that have \\"d\\" in them. So let's look at -4*d and 8*d. -4*d is like taking away 4 d's, and 8*d is like adding 8 d's. 2. If you take away 4 d's (-4*d) and then add 8 d's (8*d), you will end up with 4 d's (because 8 - 4 = 4). So now our equation looks like this: 4*d + 12 = 0 3. Now, we want to get \\"d\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to get rid of the 12 on the same side as d. We can think of the 12 as being added to the 4 d's, so we will do the opposite to cancel it out, which is subtracting 12 from both sides. Here's what the new equation will look like: 4*d = -12 (we subtracted 12 from both sides) 4. We're getting closer! Now we have 4 times d equals -12 (4*d = -12). To find out what \\"d\\" is, we need to divide both sides by 4 because right now it's multiplied by 4. This is what the final step looks like: d = -12 ÷ 4 5. And when we do that division, we find out that \\"d\\" is equal to -3, because -12 divided by 4 equals -3.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, it can be determined that the Blue group, which focused on weight training for 3 months, did not increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months. Step-by-step justification: 1. The hint states that weight lifting exercises primarily increase the size and strength of skeletal muscles. 2. On the other hand, the hint also indicates that running exercises enhance the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles, which are responsible for pumping blood through the heart. 3. Since the Blue group was involved in weight training, their primary improvement was in the size and strength of their skeletal muscles rather than their cardiac muscles. 4.

A \\"price war \\"is taking shape between traditional bookstores and online bookstores. Faced with the low-cost advantage of online bookstores, traditional ones can do nothing but lower their prices. At the same time, online bookstores are also starting price wars between each other. Now some traditional bookstores are trying their best to attract buyers in their own way. They exhibit books better and provide a very relaxed reading environment in the bookstore. Even though, traditional bookstores can hardly compete with some of the advantages of online bookstores, for example 24-hour service.

Article: When you travel in South America, you'd better pay attention to the following three kinds of dangerous South American animals. Piranhas Although only a small number of piranhas are considered to be dangerous to humans, the red-bellied piranha is definitely one of those. Evidence has shown that a large group of piranhas can absolutely eat a herd of large animals crossing the river, leaving only bones. This fish lives in the freshwater streams of South America, and they can smell the blood from far away and launch attacks swiftly. It is said that they are only dangerous to humans if the water volumes are less and lower. Anacondas This South American monster of a creature often appears in the films or your nightmares!They have weighed over 230 kilograms. It is often considered to be the biggest snake in the world. You certainly don't want to get caught alone with this snake due to its method of attacking and killing its victim. It is indeed a remarkably different brand of snake type as it regularly coils around all over its target, increasing the pressure until eventually its victim dies. Its jaws are powered by large muscles that produce enough power for its over 100 sharp teeth to pass through the thick skin of an crocodile. They don't have poison. Sometimes they prefer to camouflage themselves so they look like their surroundings and swiftly draw back when humans are near. Golden Poisonous Frogs The golden poison frog might be the most-deadly of the South American animal, which is protected by means of poison. This very small frog, less than 55 mm in length, packs enough punch to take down a pair of African bull elephants. This apparently harmless frog has always been known to have killed people who have touched it directly. It's also been noted that chicken and dogs have died by contacting things on which a golden poison frog had wandered! In intense colors, they normally look attractive to their targets. Question: What can we learn about piranhas from the passage? Options: A: Piranhas are the most dangerous animals. B: Piranhas like to live in the deep seabed.

Article: About a third of all tumors discovered in routine mammography screenings are unlikely to result in illness, according to a new study that says 30 years of the breast cancer exams have resulted in the overdiagnosis of 1.3 million American women.The report, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, argues that the increase in breast cancer survival rates over the last few decades is due mostly to improved therapies and not screenings, which are intended to flag tumors when they are small and most susceptible to treatment. Instead, the widespread use of mammograms now results in the overdiagnosis of breast cancer in roughly 70,000 patients each year, needlessly exposing those women to the cost and trauma of treatment, the authors wrote.\\"Our study raises serious questions about the value of screening mammography,\\" wrote Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at Dartmouth College 's Geisel School of Medicine. \\"It clarifies that the benefit of mortality reduction is probably smaller, and the harm of overdiagnosis probably larger, than has been previously recognized.\\"The study adds to a long-running controversy over screening mammography. Its conclusions are based upon an increasing recognition that sophisticated screening can detect ever-smaller groups of cancer-like cells that would never become dangerous if left alone.Some radiologists and other proponents of routine annual screenings denounced the study as harmful to women and said it was part of a coordinated campaign to cut back on the tests to reduce healthcare expenses.\\"This is simply malicious nonsense,\\" said Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, a senior breast imager at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . \\"It is time to stop blaming mammography screening for 'overdiagnosis' and 'overtreatment' in an effort to deny women access to screening.\\"Welch and Dr. Archie Bleyer, an oncologist in Bend, Ore., analyzed screening data collected by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . They found that between 1976 and 2008, diagnosis of early-stage cancers had more than doubled from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women. Meanwhile, the number of late-stage cancers fell 8%, from 102 cases to 94 cases per 100,000 women.The authors reasoned that if screening were to help patients, it must not only find more early-stage cancers — which it has — it must also reduce the incidence of late-stage cancers, because the tumors would have been eliminated when they were small.But the data found that this was not the case. For every 122 additional breast cancers detected early, the number of late-stage cancers fell by only eight. To the authors, this suggested something other than screening was largely responsible for the drop in breast cancer deaths.Welch said the gap was even more apparent when they factored in data for women under the age of 40, who are generally too young to get regular mammograms and therefore served as a control group of sorts. The rate of breast cancer deaths for women 40 and over declined by 28% over the 32 years, while deaths for younger women fell by 42%.\\"There was a larger relative reduction in mortality among women who were not exposed to screening mammography than among those who were exposed,\\" the authors wrote. \\"We are left to conclude, as others have, that the good news in breast cancer — decreasing mortality — must largely be the result of improved treatment, not screening.\\"Welch, an expert on screening and overdiagnosis for many forms of cancer, said the disparity between early- and late-stage diagnosis trends was probably the result of tumors being detected that were too small to ever cause clinical symptoms. He said it was likely that many of the suspicious cells revealed by screening mammography would have regressed, or never progressed to malignancy.The idea that breast tumors may resolve on their own has been advanced by European doctors for several years. Welch and others suspect that screening technology has allowed doctors to find cells that may resemble cancer, but whose true nature is only beginning to be understood.\\"We hear the word 'cancer' and we all assume the definition that's in my medical dictionary — it's a tumor that, left untreated, will inexorably grow and cause death,\\" Welch said. \\"But now, as we look for really early forms of the disease, we realize the pathologic definition of cancer includes abnormalities that may come and go.\\"Such growths are so small that in the past they would never have been detected by a doctor or reported by a patient. That is no longer the case, Welch said.\\"Our ability to detect things is far ahead of our wisdom of knowing what they really mean,\\" he said.What's more, cancers can now be treated successfully even after they grow large enough to cause symptoms, thereby reducing the benefit of catching them at the earliest stages. He compared screening for breast cancer to screening for pneumonia : \\"Since pneumonia can be treated successfully, no one would suggest that we screen for it.\\"The study was roundly criticized by radiologists who specialize in breast imaging, who questioned its methodology and the suggestion that some cancer-like growths should be ignored.\\"It's kind of unbelievable that they're telling us we're finding too many early-stage cancers,\\" said Dr. Stamatia Destounis, a breast imager in Rochester, N.Y. \\"Isn't that the point?\\"She acknowledged that screening mammography was not perfect and that some growths would be discovered that were benign. However, the notion that cancer-like masses should not be treated was difficult to accept.\\"There is no way for us to know which early-stage breast cancer would not progress and which one would progress to an invasive, aggressive breast cancer,\\" Destounis said. \\"How would we tell a patient, 'Chances are this is early and it's probably not going to progress for a long time, if ever, so I don't think you need to do much here'? There's just no way for us to say that.\\"Dr. Stephen Feig, a radiologist at UC Irvine and president of the American Society of Breast Disease, called the study scientifically weak and worried that it would dissuade women from undergoing screening. \\"This is actually harming women,\\" he said.Most medical organizations, including the American Cancer Society , advise healthy women to get screened every one or two years beginning at age 40.In 2009, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force came to the controversial conclusion that this level of testing exacted an unnecessary toll on patients in the form of financial cost, anxiety, radiation exposure, false positives and overtreatment. The government advisory panel now recommends that women between the ages of 50 and 74 with no risk factors for breast cancer be screened every other year. Women who are at increased risk — because of family history or certain genetic characteristics — may begin screening at age 40 and have mammograms more often, the panel says.Welch said he was not advising women to stop being screened, only that they should be aware of mammography's shortcomings. Instead of conducting annual screenings on the basis of age, he said, the test should be based on risk: \\"It's women at the highest risk of dying from breast cancer that stand to benefit the most from screening, and they're the least likely to be overdiagnosed.\\"He also emphasized that women who develop symptoms, such as a lump in the breast, should not hesitate to get a mammogram.\\"No one argues about the value of diagnostic mammography,\\" he said. \\"The question is whether we should invite women, coerce them, threaten them, scare them to come get checked when nothing's wrong.\\" ||||| The growing use of routine mammograms over the past 30 years has done little to lower the death rate from breast cancer but has sharply increased the number of women who are wrongly diagnosed with the disease, a new study reported. (Rui Vieira/ASSOCIATED PRESS) The routine use of mammograms has led to more than 1 million women being unnecessarily treated for breast cancer over the past three decades, according to the latest scientific report to cast skepticism on the effectiveness of the test. The study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded that nearly one-third of women diagnosed with breast cancer would never have developed the full-blown disease if left untreated. Nevertheless, in such cases patients typically undergo invasive procedures such as surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, said H. Gilbert Welch, a coauthor of the study and a professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. “These are major medical interventions and they’re certainly not something you would want to undergo if you didn’t need to,” he said. The researchers also concluded that today’s sharply lower death rate for breast cancer is mainly due to factors such as improved treatments rather than early detection through mammograms. The new study immediately fueled the already fierce debate over how often women should get mammograms, a controversy that has embroiled policymakers, politicians and physicians, as well as their female patients. The American Cancer Society warned that the study “must be viewed with caution.” The American College of Radiology attacked the validity of the study, charging that it was spreading “misinformation” and “the cost may be lost lives.” The report is the latest study to undermine the once-strong consensus that regular screenings are crucial to safeguarding women’s health. Just in the past two years, a major study of Norwegian breast cancer patients found that routine mammograms reduced the risk of dying from breast cancer by less than 10 percent. Another study found no effect on death rates when comparing European nations where screening became prevalent in the 1990s with those where it became widespread in the 2000s. Even before those findings, in November 2009, a key federal panel revised its guidelines on mammograms to say that women should begin regular screenings at age 50 rather than age 40, and then get the exam every other year rather than annually. However, that revision by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, made as Congress was crafting the new health-care law, was assailed not only by groups such as the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology but also by the Obama administration. In 2010, lawmakers tweaked a mandate in the health-care law requiring insurers to cover preventive services recommended by the task force free of charge. The law specifies that when it comes to mammograms, insurers must follow the task force’s old guidelines. Wednesday’s study analyzed changes in the rates of early- and late-stage breast cancer in the United States over time. The authors’ premise was that if screening were effective, its growing use would result in greater detection of early-stage breast cancers and a corresponding drop in the prevalence of late-stage cancers. Instead, they found that while the number of early-stage cancers doubled over the past three decades, the rate at which women were found to have late-stage cancer dropped by only 8 percent. Welch speculated that as mammography technology has become more advanced, doctors are discovering breast lesions in such an early state of development it is virtually impossible to distinguish them from benign cell clusters. Yet even as the screenings produce false positives, they fail to catch forms of breast cancer that develop rapidly, explaining why the more widespread use of screenings has done so little to curb the rate at which late-stage breast cancer is found. “The sad fact is that there’s a subset of women who develop such an aggressive form of cancer it literally can’t be caught early,” said Welch. Debra L. Monticciolo, a physician who chairs the American College of Radiology’s Quality and Safety Commission, questioned many of the study’s methods, including the data used to account for fluctuations in the underlying incidence of breast cancer due to factors like the use of hormones. “It stuns me that this got through peer review,” said Monticciolo. She added that as a physician, she found it hard to believe that such a large share of screenings produce false positives. If that were the case, there would be countless tales of miraculous recoveries by women who refuse traditional treatment after being diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. “I’ve never seen such a case. And there’s nothing like that in the literature,” said Monticciolo. Most important, she said, new studies continue to confirm the benefits of screenings. “Mammograms clearly save lives,” she said. Archie Bleyer, a professor at the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University who is the study’s other coauthor, said he wouldn’t dream of suggesting that women cease getting mammograms altogether. “There are clearly women who are benefiting from doing this,” he said. But he and Welch said their findings suggest that the message to women about mammograms needs to be more nuanced. “We need to start telling the truth,” said Welch. “We’ve promoted this as if it’s the most important thing a woman can do for her health. . . . And the truth is that it’s a really close call.” Women in their 40s who feel comfortable getting annual mammograms should not be dissuaded from doing so, he said. “But women who have never felt good about it, who felt coerced into the procedure, should feel equally good about not having it.” Similarly, Welch said, women who do get screening mammograms and are found to have a tumor in a very early stage may want to consider alternatives to aggressive treatment — engaging in watchful waiting, for instance, or signing up for a clinical trial of drugs that may halt or slow the progression of cancer. Men have faced similar issues in deciding what to do about screening and treatment of prostate cancer, he said. “We should tell women about the trade-offs and we should allow them to make their own decision,” he said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A study has found that about a third of all tumors discovered during routine mammography screenings may not result in illness, suggesting that 30 years of breast cancer screening has led to the overdiagnosis of 1.3 million American women.

It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Sudan (\\"as-Sdn\\", ), also known as North Sudan and officially the Republic of the Sudan (\\"Jumhriyyat as-Sdn\\"), is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Before the Sudanese Civil War, South Sudan was part of Sudan but broke away in 2011. Its predominant religion is Islam. - A land bridge, in biogeography, is an isthmus or wider land connection between otherwise separate areas, over which animals and plants are able to cross and colonise new lands. A land bridge can be created by marine regression, in which sea levels fall, exposing shallow, previously submerged sections of continental shelf; or when new land is created by plate tectonics; or occasionally when the sea floor rises due to post-glacial rebound after an ice age. - The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To the north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley. - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. - The Gulf of Aqaba (\\"Khalij al-Aqabah\\") or Gulf of Eilat (\\"Mifrats Eilat\\") is a large gulf at the northern tip of the Red Sea, east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian mainland. Its coastline is divided between four countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. - A tomb (from \\"tumbos\\") is a repository for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. - Duathathor-Henuttawy, Henuttawy or Henttawy \\"(\\"Adorer of Hathor; Mistress of the Two Lands\\")\\" was an ancient Egyptian princess and later queen. - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Ramesses XI (also written Ramses and Rameses) reigned from 1107 BC to 1078 BC or 1077 BC and was the tenth and final pharaoh of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt. He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30. The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this king's highest known date of Year 10 of the \\"Whm Mswt\\" era or Year 28 of his reign. One scholar, Ad Thijs, has even suggested that Ramesses XI reigned as long as 33 yearssuch is the degree of uncertainty surrounding the end of his long reign. - Chronological and genealogical position. While the High Priest of Amun Piankh (or Payankh) has been assumed to be a son-in-law of Herihor and his heir to the Theban office of the High Priest of Amun, recent studies by Karl Jansen-Winkeln of the surviving temple inscriptions and monumental works by Herihor and Piankh in Upper Egypt imply that Piankh was actually Herihor's predecessor. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - The Temple of Khonsu is an ancient Egyptian temple. It is located with the large Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, in Luxor, Egypt. The edifice is an example of an almost complete New Kingdom temple, and was originally constructed by Ramesses III, on the site of an earlier temple. The gateway of this temple is at the end of the avenue of sphinxes that ran to the Luxor Temple. In Ptolemaic times,Ptolemy III Euergetes constructed a great gateway and enclosure wall for the temple; only the gateway now remains (see below). Inscriptions inside the forecourt of the temple were made in the time of Herihor. - Pinedjem I was the High Priest of Amun at Thebes in Ancient Egypt from 1070 to 1032 BC and the \\"de facto\\" ruler of the south of the country from 1054 BC. He was the son of the High Priest Piankh. However, many Egyptologists today believe that the succession in the Amun priesthood actually ran from Piankh to Herihor to Pinedjem I. Reign. According to the new hypothesis regarding the succession of the Amun priesthood, Pinedjem I was too young to succeed to the High Priesthood of Amun after the death of Piankh. Herihor instead intervened to assume to this office. After Herihor's death, Pinedjem I finally claimed this office which had once been held by his father Piankh. This interpretation is supported by the decorations from the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak where Herihor's wall reliefs here are immediately followed by those of Pinedjem I with no intervening phase for Piankh and also by the long career of Pinedjem I who served as High Priest of Amun and later as king at Thebes. He inherited a political and religious base of power at Thebes. Pinedjem strengthened his control over both Middle and Upper Egypt and asserted his kingdom's virtual independence from the Twenty-first Dynasty based at Tanis. He married Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, to cement his relations with the other powerful families of the period. Their son, Psusennes I, went on to become Pharaoh at Tanis, thereby removing at a stroke the gap between the two families. In practice, however, the 21st dynasty kings and the Theban high priests were probably never very far apart politically since they respected each other's political autonomy. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards. - The Valley of the Kings, the \\"Valley of the Gates of the Kings\\", is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, tombs were constructed for the Pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt). - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - KV4 is a tomb in the Valley of the Kings ( Egypt ) . The tomb was initiated for the burial of Ramesses XI but it is likely that its construction was abandoned and that it was never used for Ramesses 's interment . It also seems likely that Pinedjem I intended to usurp this tomb for his own burial , but that he too abandoned the plan . KV4 is notable for being the last royal tomb that was quarried in the Valley and because it has been interpreted as being a workshop used during the official dismantling of the royal necropolis in the early Third Intermediate Period . - Khepermaatre Ramesses X (also written Ramses and Rameses) (ruled c. 1111 BC 1107 BC) was the ninth ruler of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His birth name was Amonhirkhepeshef. His \\"prenomen\\" or throne name, Khepermaatre, means \\"The Justice of Re Abides.\\" - Psusennes I (Greek ) was the third pharaoh of the 21st Dynasty who ruled from Tanis between 1047 1001 BC. \\"Psusennes\\" is the Greek version of his original name Pasibkhanu or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut (Egyptian \\"or-p3-sib3--<n>-niwt\\") which means \\"The Star Appearing in the City\\" while his throne name, Akheperre Setepenamun, translates as \\"Great are the Manifestations of Ra, chosen of Amun.\\" He was the son of Pinedjem I and Henuttawy, Ramesses XI's daughter by Tentamun.

The Historic Centre of Callao is located west of Historic Centre of Lima, the country's capital, and is part of the Lima Metropolitan Area. Callao borders Lima Province on the north, east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. - The Battle of Ayacucho was a decisive military encounter during the Peruvian War of Independence. It was the battle that secured the independence of Peru and ensured independence for the rest of South America. In Peru it is considered the end of the Spanish American wars of independence, although the campaign of the victor Antonio José de Sucre, continued through 1825 in Upper Peru and the siege of the fortresses Chiloé and Callao finally ended in 1826. - Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá (17951830), known as the \\"Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho\\", was a Venezuelan independence leader and the second President of Bolivia.

Although various regions of Spanish America objected to crown policies the restricted trade and privileged Spanish-born officials over American-born, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\" These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century.

The wars of independence took place with the background of the 1780-1781 uprising by indigenous leader Túpac Amaru II and the earlier removal of Upper Peru and the Río de la Plata regions from the Viceroyalty of Peru. Because of this the viceroy often had the support of the \\"Lima oligarchy,\\" who saw their elite interests threatened by popular rebellion and were opposed to the new commercial class in Buenos Aires.

Given the following context: During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

Jill's stack of cash she received would not fit inside her wallet, the OPTIONS: 1. cash was too wide. 2. wallet was too wide.","completion":"Jill's stack of cash she received would not fit inside her wallet, as the cash was too wide. Consequently, she found herself in a peculiar predicament, having to carefully extract several individual bills and fold them in half in order to accommodate the unwieldy pile into her once well-organized, slender wallet. This endeavor turned out to be quite time-consuming, much to her chagrin, as she fumbled to make room for each bill, wondering how exactly this unexpected windfall had landed into her hands. Initially, she considered multiple alternative methods to store her newly acquired wealth, such as procuring a more spacious wallet or perhaps a small, secure pouch specifically designed for such occasions. Yet, the urgency of the situation, along with unforeseen logistical challenges, presented an obstacle in pursuing these options for temporary storage of the cash. As Jill continued to stuff some of the bills into the various compartments of her wallet, an idea struck her like a lightning bolt – she could use this unexpected financial boost to do something meaningful. Instead of simply depositing the money into her bank account or splurging on an impulsive shopping spree, she could perhaps invest it in her education, put it towards a well-deserved family vacation, or even support a cause that was close to her heart. Thoughts raced through her mind as a fresh sense of excitement coursed through her veins, the initial annoyance of the uncooperative cash and overfilled wallet now masked by the potential future opportunities that lay ahead of her. In her heart of hearts, she knew that this moment carried immense transformative potential – Jill had to ensure that it counted. Emboldened and inspired by the bevy of possibilities, she carefully placed the remainder of the cash inside her wallet, vowing to herself to put it to good use and make the most significant impact possible. With each fold, she felt her sense of purpose and determination growing stronger, solidifying her resolve to make the world a better place – one carefully calculated financial decision at a time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The answer you provided doesn't answer the specific question about who the two United States Senators from Pennsylvania are. As of my knowledge to date (and this may change in the future due to elections or other circumstances), the two United States Senators from Pennsylvania are Pat Toomey (Republican) and Bob Casey Jr. (Democrat). However, you're correct in noting that United States Senators are popularly elected for a six-year term, beginning January 3rd. This applies to all U.S states, not only Pennsylvania. Senators may serve unlimited consecutive terms. This six-year term length was designed for stability, ensuring that the entire senate isn't up for election at the same time. Only one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. This ensures that two-thirds of the senators will always have at least two years of experience. Remember, these specific senators may change as they're dependent on election results. In case of resignation, death, or expulsion, the Governor of the state may appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the next scheduled statewide election.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme. Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of \\"forcing\\" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease.[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image.[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to \\"east\\" and \\"west\\" were switched around.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the report that made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection? ? When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

Are ballerinas allowed to get tanned?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. They address different aspects of a ballerina's life and career. Let's look at each question separately for a better understanding. 1. Ballet: What do a ballerina's feet look like at the end of her career? This question is regarding the physical appearance and condition of a ballerina's feet after having spent a significant amount of time practicing, performing, and living as a professional ballet dancer. Ballet is an extremely demanding and physically strenuous art form, requiring ballerinas to perform on their toes (en pointe) and execute a variety of jumps, spins, and movements that put considerable stress on their feet and bodies. As a result, it is not uncommon for ballerinas to experience various foot problems, injuries, or deformities over the course of their careers. These issues might include calluses, blisters, bunions, hammertoes, ingrown toenails, and stress fractures, among others. The level of wear and tear on a ballerina's feet can greatly depend on factors such as the duration of her career, the intensity of her training and performance schedule, and her personal foot care and injury prevention habits. Hence, this question primarily focuses on understanding the physical consequences of a long-term career in ballet on a dancer's feet, which may or may not have lifelong effects on their overall health and mobility. 2. Are ballerinas allowed to get tanned? This question relates to the aesthetic or visual aspect of a ballet dancer's appearance, specifically in regard to their skin color and whether they are allowed or encouraged to get a tan. Ballet companies and schools often have particular aesthetic preferences or requirements for their dancers, which can include factors such as height, body type, hair color, and even skin tone. These preferences can vary depending on the company, the artistic director, the country, and evolving cultural norms. Traditionally, ballet emphasized a uniform look for dancers, often preferring light skin tones. However, as ballet becomes more diverse and inclusive, this mindset has begun to change. In contemporary ballet companies, there is a greater variety in the skin tones of their dancers, and as such, tanning might not be strictly regulated or considered an issue. That being said, many dancers may still adhere to specific aesthetic guidelines or preferences set by their companies, which could require them to maintain a certain skin tone or appearance. It's also essential to consider the potential health risks associated with excessive tanning, from skin damage to increased risk of skin cancer. In summary, the two questions address distinct aspects of a ballerina's life. The first focuses on the physical impact of a ballet career on a dancer's feet, while the second deals with the aesthetic requirements for a dancer's appearance, specifically skin tone, and the evolving conversation around diverse representation in ballet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: To calculate the approximate yield to maturity, you need to know the coupon payment, the face value of the bond, the price paid for the bond and the number of years to maturity. These figures are plugged into the formula ApproxYTM=(C+((F−P)/n))/(F+P)/2{displaystyle ApproxYTM=(C+((F-P)/n))/(F+P)/2}. C = the coupon payment, or the amount paid in interest to the bond holder each year. F = the face value, or the full value of the bond. P = the price the investor paid for the bond. n = the number of years to maturity. Suppose you purchased a 1,000 for 920. The interest is 10 percent, and it will mature in 10 years. The coupon payment is 100 (1,000x.10=100{displaystyle 1,000x.10=100}). The face value is 1,000, and the price is 920. The number of years to maturity is 10. Use the formula: (100+((1,000−920)/10))/(1,000+920)/2{displaystyle (100+((1,000-920)/10))/(1,000+920)/2} Using this calculation, you arrive at an approximate yield to maturity of 11.25 percent. Plug the yield to maturity back into the formula to solve for P, the price. Chances are, you will not arrive at the same value. This is because this yield to maturity calculation is an estimate. Decide whether you are satisfied with the estimate or if you need more precise information. Use the formula P=C∗((1−(1/(1+i)n))/i)+M/((1+i)n){displaystyle P=C*((1-(1/(1+i)^{n}))/i)+M/((1+i)^{n})}, where, P = the bond price, C = the coupon payment, i = the yield to maturity rate, M = the face value and n = the total number of coupon payments. If you plug the 11.25 percent YTM into the formula to solve for P, the price, you get a price of 927.15. A lower yield to maturity will result in a higher bond price. The bond price you get when you plug the 11.25 percent interest figure back into the formula is too high, indicating that this YTM estimate may be somewhat low. Summary:","completion":"To find out how much money you can make from a bond, you need to use a special math recipe called \\"yield to maturity\\" (YTM). You need a few ingredients for this recipe: the yearly interest payment, the bond's full value, how much you paid for the bond, and how many years until the bond is all done. There's a formula you can use to help you figure it out. For example, imagine you bought a bond worth 1,000 for 920. It pays 10% interest per year and ends in 10 years. You use the formula and find out that you'll make about 11.25% more money each year. But this number is just an estimate, and it might not be exactly right. If you want to be more precise and find the exact bond price, you can use a different formula. With this formula, you can see you should have paid 927.15 instead of 920, which means the 11.25 % estimate may be a little low."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The last time Fernando Alonso joined McLaren, he left the team one season into a three-year contract after falling out spectacularly with the team's figurehead, Ron Dennis. Seven years on, the two men find themselves cast together all over again, in the hope that this time the story ends a little more happily. Up and down the Formula 1 paddock, the thought of the single-minded two-time world champion and McLaren's overbearing chairman working together again continues to be viewed with incredulity. How, many people ask, can McLaren have voluntarily re-signed a man who effectively cost them nearly £50m and got them thrown out of the 2007 constructors' world championship? It's an important question in the context of the 33-year-old rejoining McLaren - if, to some extent, a misleading representation of what happened. So, before we turn our attention to 2015, and the prospects for driver, team and their new engine partnership with Honda, we have to take a closer look at what happened a little over seven years ago during that tumultuous summer. Alonso joined McLaren in 2007 straight after winning two consecutive titles with Renault. They were symbolic of the passing of the flame from one generation to the next. Michael Schumacher, beaten in a straight fight in 2006, had retired, and Alonso was established as the new standard in F1. His season with McLaren coincided with their involvement in the 'spy-gate' scandal, in which their chief designer was found in possession of 780 pages of confidential Ferrari technical information. At an initial hearing by governing body the FIA, McLaren were found guilty of breaking the rules, but escaped punishment on the grounds there was no evidence the information had benefited the team. That seemed to be that until a few weeks later when, in the course of a bitter row with Dennis over the weekend of the Hungarian Grand Prix, Alonso threatened to reveal to the FIA potentially incriminating email conversations with McLaren test driver Pedro De La Rosa on the subject of the Ferrari information. A little while later, Alonso's adviser came back and apologised, explaining the Spaniard had been upset and wanted to take back the threat. But rather than wait for Alonso to calm down and talk it over again, Dennis had panicked and phoned FIA president Max Mosley to tell him of the existence of the emails, while assuring him there was \\"no information, nothing to come out\\". It was a miscalculation, albeit an understandable one in the context of the febrile, paranoid atmosphere at the time and Dennis's antagonistic personal relationship with Mosley. And despite Dennis's reassurances, the case was reopened and McLaren were hit by the aforementioned punishment. As it turned out, Dennis's phone call made no difference. Mosley already knew about the emails and was planning to re-open the case. Media playback is not supported on this device The point, though, is that Dennis's actions were a reflection of how bad his relationship with Alonso had become, in the context of the knowledge that Alonso's manager was Flavio Briatore, then the team principal of Renault. Briatore was a close friend of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and - like Mosley and Ecclestone - no fan of Dennis on a personal level. Whether or not Alonso's threat was real did not really matter. Once he made it, the result was inevitable. If Alonso knew, Dennis figured, so did Briatore - and, given the relationships involved, it was asking too much for that information not to make it to Mosley one way or another. And Dennis was right - Mosley says now that he knew about the emails because Alonso had told Briatore about them, and Briatore had blabbed. Why, you might wonder, would McLaren want Alonso back, after all that? The first and most important reason is obvious - because they believe he is about the best driver out there. The second is that McLaren need to make a statement of intent at the start of their relationship with Honda, and signing Alonso is a big one. The third is that Honda badly wanted him - the Japanese company have long been huge fans of the Spaniard. In tempting him away from Ferrari, McLaren-Honda have secured a magnificent driver, as his former colleague Rob Smedley can attest. Before joining Williams this year as head of performance, Smedley spent 10 years at Ferrari, gaining three years of first-hand experience of Schumacher and spending his final four years as Felipe Massa's race engineer, with Alonso on the other side of the garage. \\"Fernando is the very best driver of his generation,\\" Smedley says. \\"I would go so far as to say if not the best ever. He is that good. He brings that much performance to the team. I am a massive fan of his. \\"To have Fernando as your team-mate, as most people have found out - Kimi Raikkonen has certainly found out this year - is not easy. You are talking about very good drivers who sit beside him on the other side of the garage. I don't think there is anyone in this paddock who could live with him.\\" On the day of the row in Hungary, McLaren's then managing director Martin Whitmarsh tried to persuade Dennis to sack Alonso immediately - before that weekend's race. Yet, some years later, Whitmarsh admitted he did not at that point have all the relevant information and when he did, he was more understanding - if not forgiving - of Alonso's actions. The issue at the heart of the problems within McLaren all that year was Alonso's demand for the team to focus their title challenge on him, rather than split their efforts by giving team-mate Lewis Hamilton equal status. That was true to McLaren's long-stated ethos. But Whitmarsh later discovered that when Dennis signed Alonso he had indeed promised him priority status, only to go back on his word. As for Dennis, when he was asked about Alonso's behaviour following the FIA's punishment of McLaren, he said, almost admiringly: \\"Competitive animals know no limits.\\" It was Whitmarsh, who became team principal at McLaren in 2009, who started the process that has led to Alonso rejoining the team. Whitmarsh approached Alonso as long ago as the summer of 2013 to make it clear he wanted him back. And the process of wooing him continued despite Dennis's ousting of Whitmarsh late last year. Whitmarsh's effective replacement, McLaren's racing director Eric Boullier, has been instrumental in convincing Alonso that he has a better chance of winning the elusive third title he craves at McLaren than at Ferrari, even though their competitive positions in 2014 suggest otherwise. Part of Boullier's sales pitch has centred on Honda. The Japanese company and McLaren are intent on reviving the glory days of their original relationship a quarter of a century ago, when with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost they won four drivers' titles in a row from 1988-91. Alonso, who has had a year of watching Ferrari's new turbo hybrid V6 engine pummelled into the ground by that of Mercedes, has been informed of Honda's progress and apparently been convinced that the Japanese engines have a better chance of taking on Mercedes than those from Maranello. Media playback is not supported on this device Equally, although McLaren's car has clearly been well behind the best in the past two years - and well off Ferrari's, too, for that matter - the team have been making changes. Specifically, these include the signing of aerodynamicist Peter Prodromou from Red Bull, where he was the right-hand man of design guru Adrian Newey on the cars that romped to four consecutive world titles from 2010-13. In three of those years a frustrated Alonso was second. There have been all sorts of rumours over the past few weeks about how exactly Alonso came to be leaving Ferrari two years before the end of his contract. But the man himself says that his intentions have never wavered. \\"In the summer, I took the decision,\\" he says. \\"I followed that direction and only time will tell whether it was a good one or a bad one.\\" Sources close to Alonso and Ferrari insist that is true. They say that he simply wanted to leave Ferrari, having lost faith that they would ever get into a position to challenge for the title within the timeframe of the years he has left at his peak - which, at 33, is probably only a handful more. Mercedes, where there is no seat open for 2015, were his first option; McLaren his second. Walk up and down the paddock and it is not hard to find people who will say Alonso is a disruptive influence and hard to handle, while, equally, there are also those who have worked closely with him who will barely say a bad word about him, and insist that he is \\"only as difficult as you allow him to be\\". But whatever Alonso's actions, they are based on his overwhelming will to win. He is desperate to win a third title, and with it the status he rightly feels he deserves in the F1 pantheon. He gives everything in his quest to achieve that and he expects his team to provide him with the equipment to do so. If there is going to be a problem between Alonso and McLaren in the next little while, its root will likely be there. Media playback is not supported on this device Alonso and Dennis have apparently buried the hatchet. But they will never be bosom buddies. After all, Dennis, a difficult and complex character, has fallen out with every good driver who has ever raced for him - Prost, Senna, Niki Lauda, Mika Hakkinen, Juan Pablo Montoya, Kimi Raikkonen, David Coulthard, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. But Dennis and Alonso will likely rub along well enough as long as things are going well, especially with Boullier acting as a buffer. The issue will be if they are uncompetitive. Alonso has gone to McLaren to win, and win big. Perhaps not next year, but sooner rather than later. If they don't deliver, or if they don't at least look like they are going to, the fall-out is unlikely to be pretty. Summary:","completion":"A long time ago, a race car driver named Fernando Alonso joined a team called McLaren. They didn't get along very well and he left after just one season. Now, after seven years, Fernando and McLaren are teaming up again, hoping for a happier ending this time. Fernando Alonso is a very good driver and McLaren believes he can help them win. They are also working with a company called Honda to make their cars even better. Everyone hopes that Fernando and McLaren can work together and win big races."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film came up short. The plot is just to ridiculous. The KGB and Soviet Union in Russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like Americans, but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated, so they grab two yanks from the US to spice things up. I don't know, but this seems just to out there. It gets really odd when next to no one in this all Russian town speaks in a Russian accent. Someone screwed up in the casting job. Also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There is one, two funny spots tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance about. The film in the end will likely put you to sleep. And, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro the US it makes me sick. The movie keeps on saying again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the Japanese in World War 2. It's films like these that makes everyone think that the US is full of itself.

To do this, subtract 4703 from both sides: -182*h + 4703 + 13705 - 4703 = 5304 - 4703 -182*h + 13705 = 601 2. Next, isolate the variable h by dividing both sides of the equation by -182: (-182*h + 13705) / -182 = 601 / -182 -182*h / -182 = -601 / 182 h = -601 / 182 3. Simplify the fraction -601 / 182: h = -601 / 182 h = -301/91 (when dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor 2) 4.

Day was a big company with lots of workers and they helped build things like houses and buildings. They had friends, called contractors and owners, who they worked with. One sad day, the Day company stopped working because of something called \\"demise.\\" This means that the company had to close down and couldn't make any more houses or buildings. Imagine if a toy store you really liked closed, and you couldn't buy the toys from there anymore. That's what happened to the people who worked with Day. The contractors, who are like the helper friends in building things, started to feel sad and worried. They were not sure if they could find new friends to work with, like Day, to help them build houses and buildings. They were also worried they wouldn't have enough money to buy things like food and toys for their families. The owners, who are the people that want the new houses and buildings, were also sad and worried. They had been waiting and saving their money for a long time to get their new homes and offices, but now Day wasn't there to help them anymore. They had to look for other companies to help them build their dream spaces. Everyone realized that when a company like Day goes away, it doesn't just affect the people who worked there. It also affects the friends who worked with them, like contractors and owners. So, people in the town started to talk about ways to help those friends find new people to work with, so they could build houses and buildings again. In the end, the story teaches us that when something big happens, like a company closing down, it can create challenges for lots of people. But by working together and finding new friends who can help, the contractors and owners can still build their beautiful houses and buildings, and make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Speaking at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, the Democratic nominee said her time off was a gift, allowing her to reflect on the campaign. She walked on stage to the sound of James Brown's I Feel Good to deliver a speech on the economy. Polls indicate a tightening White House race, with 54 days to election day. Mrs Clinton's return comes a day after her doctor said she was \\"healthy and fit\\". A history of US presidential bad health She told a boisterous crowd at Thursday's rally: \\"With just two months to go until election day, sitting at home was pretty much the last place I want to be.\\" \\"People accuse me of all kinds of things,\\" she added, \\"you probably have seen that, but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets.\\" The 68-year-old said she felt \\"lucky\\" that she could afford to take a few days off, compared with the millions of Americans who could not. At a brief press conference afterwards, Mrs Clinton was asked whether she had shared details of her pneumonia diagnosis with her running mate, Tim Kaine. She appeared to parse her words carefully as she replied that \\"many senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people\\". \\"This was an ailment that many people just power through,\\" she continued, \\"and that's what I thought I would do as well.\\" She then jetted off to a give a speech at an event in Washington DC. The race has focused on both candidates' state of health and medical records in recent days. As countless thousands of armchair physicians looked on, Hillary Clinton took to the campaign trail for the first time since her near-collapse on Sunday. It was a speech where \\"optics\\" mattered at least as much as what she said. Did she look healthy? Was her voice strong? Aside from a bit of hoarseness, Mrs Clinton hit her marks - a sharp contrast from the wobbly figure helped into a van on Sunday. If she keeps this up, her health concerns will likely recede into the background. Perhaps more notably from a strategic perspective was Mrs Clinton's humbler, more personal tone. She admitted her faults, but said one of her strengths was never quitting. Early on, she pivoted from talking about her illness to the struggles of Americans who can't afford quality healthcare. Although she took swipes at Donald Trump, she only referred to him as \\"my opponent\\". As she told the press after her speech, she wants to give Americans \\"something to vote for, not just against\\". Her campaign has relentlessly bashed Mr Trump over the past months, but she seems to be acknowledging that this alone may not be enough to win her the presidency. On Thursday, Donald Trump released a letter from his doctor saying he is in \\"excellent physical health\\", albeit overweight. The Republican nominee earlier this year released a brief memo from the same physician asserting he would be \\"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\\". The 70-year-old businessman also discussed his health with Dr Mehmet Oz during a taped episode of the medical chat show, which aired on Thursday. At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday, Mr Trump used Mrs Clinton's recent health scare to cast doubt on her stamina. He said: \\"I don't know folks, do you think Hillary Clinton would be able to stand up here for an hour?\\" On Sunday, she had to be helped into a van after abruptly leaving the World Trade Center memorial after aides said she felt \\"overheated\\".

The group barely made it through the fight: This indicates that the challenge was tough, and they had a hard time overcoming it. The group's struggle contributed to the narrator's frustration and disappointment, as they were likely hoping for a smoother gaming experience. 2. Undergeared puggies: The narrator mentioned that many of their teammates were undergeared, which suggests that their equipment and abilities were inadequate for the level of difficulty they were facing. This could have put more pressure on the narrator to perform better and compensate for the weaker players, which in turn might have caused them further stress and dissatisfaction. 3. Difficulty with Leotheras the Blind battle: While the fight against Leotheras the Blind went better for the narrator, they still ran into issues, such as not getting the whirlwind attack. Although they managed to kill their demon relatively quickly the first time, the fact that they struggled with some aspects of the fight further compounded their feelings of frustration. 4. The second demon killed the narrator: In the game, players often aim to stay alive and deal damage or provide support to their team effectively. The fact that the narrator died due to the second demon could be seen as a failure on their part. This would be especially frustrating if the rest of their team did not suffer a similar fate. 5. Lack of healing: The narrator mentioned that they received no heals during the encounter with the second demon, which ultimately led to their death in the game. This could signify a lack of support or teamwork from their fellow players, which can be upsetting and demoralizing for someone who is invested in group cooperation and success. In summary, the narrator was upset while playing the game due to a combination of factors, including a challenging fight, undergeared teammates, issues with their own performance, and a perceived lack of support from their group. Together, these factors contributed to a negative gaming experience, leaving the narrator feeling frustrated and disappointed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene. On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Toyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds - two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media. It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \\"outdoing\\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \\"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\\". He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \\"panicked\\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene. According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \\"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Oystein\\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \\"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\\". Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice. At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994. A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\". The book Lords of Chaos says of Euronymous: He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical\\". In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1993 interview he said \\"There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted\\". Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him to be his best friend) said that Euronymous \\"was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme\\". Ihsahn, who frequented Helvete, said that \\"if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted\\" there, which was important to be a part of the Helvete scene. However, Lords of Chaos claims that many who knew Euronymous say \\"the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that - a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality\\". They include Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes and Blackthorn. Faust said that with Euronymous, \\"there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire\\". When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: \\"I think that was very much to create fear among people\\". He added that the scene \\"wanted to be in opposition to society\\" and \\"tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy\\". Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (who was friends with Euronymous from 1983 until his death) described Euronymous as \\"blond, health oriented, very good at school. He worked-out a lot, didn't smoke, didn't drink ... That was the Oystein we knew. A nice guy, a family guy ... But when we weren't around he could play out his role\\". Manheim claimed that Euronymous became \\"extreme\\" towards the end of his life: \\"He liked telling people that they were worthless; [that] he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' ... I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a megalomaniac\\". In the documentary Pure Fucking Mayhem he said \\"Oystein's daily life was a total theater\\" that was based on the black metal \\"archetype\\" of 'Euronymous'. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What were some of Euronymous' beliefs?","completion":"Euronymous, a key figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene, claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness, and fun.

Q:This article: The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism. The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S.

Summarize this article: Knitting on your arms uses the same basic technique as knitting with needles. However, it can be more challenging at first since you will be using your fingers to create the new stitches. To knit the first row, take the free end of the yarn (set the tail aside) and loop that yarn around your hand. Then, insert this loop into the first loop on your right arm. As you pull the loop through, slide the old loop off your right arm and slide the new loop onto your left arm. Continue to knit the stitches in this way until you reach the end of the first row. As you knit using your arms, you will be transferring the stitches from one arm to the other. That means that if you started on your right arm, then you will be transferring the stitches over to your left arm by the end of the first row, and then back to your right arm by the end of the second row. Continue knitting until you have achieved the desired length. You will need to bind off the stitches to finish the blanket. As with knitting using needles, you will be casting off by knitting the first two loops and then pulling each loop through the one that is behind it. For example, start by knitting the first two loops in your row. Then, stop knitting and grasp the first loop in your row with your fingers. Pull this loop up and over the second loop on your hand so that it is secured and you only have one loop on your hand. To continue casting off, follow the pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second loop until you reach the end of the row. As you cast off, you should never have more than two loops on your casting off arm. After you have cast off the final loop, pull the free end of the yarn through the loop. Then, weave the tail end of the yarn through the loops on the edge of the blanket to hide it. You can also tie the end of the yarn in a knot going through one of the stitches to secure it. Trim off any excess yarn from the tail and your blanket is complete! Summary:","completion":"Arm knitting uses the same technique as needle knitting but can be more challenging initially as fingers are used to create stitches. To start, loop yarn around your hand and transfer loops between arms to create rows. Continue knitting until desired length is achieved. Bind off stitches to finish the blanket by casting off, following a pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second until the end of the row.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Dialogue: W: Have a look at our new jeans, please. They've just arrived and they are on sale. M: Uh.. Thanks. I will let you know if I need help. Question: What's the woman's job? - A librarian. - A shop assistant. - A secretary. A:","completion":"The woman's job is a shop assistant. The dialogue indicates two individuals, a woman (W) and a man (M), interacting in a specific setting. The woman suggests the man, 'Have a look at our new jeans, please,' noting that the jeans are recently arrived and on sale. Her reference to 'our new jeans' suggests that she works in the environment where the jeans are being sold since she aligns herself with the products by using 'our.' The phrase 'they've just arrived' further supports this as it implies that part of her role includes keeping track of stock, merchandise arrivals and promoting the products to the customers. This act of promoting goods to customers or suggesting items strongly hints towards retail work. Furthermore, the protocol she maintains in handling the customer, his interests or intentions, such as when the man mentions 'I’ll let you know if I need help,' this hands-off but available response echoes typical retail employee behaviour where customers are allowed the freedom to browse products but help is readily available if needed. In consideration of these factors, it would be reasonable to deduce that the woman is a 'shop assistant'. A shop assistants' job typically includes tasks such as handling transactions, greeting customers, answering customers' questions about merchandise and products, restocking shelves, promoting current sales to customers, and keeping track of what is in stock. On the flip side, it is improbable she would be a 'librarian' or a 'secretary' based on the context of the dialogue. The role of a librarian typically involves managing collections of books and periodicals, assisting customers including helping them locate reading materials or with other information needs and they do not sell clothes. Similarly, a secretary typically manages administrative duties in an office setting, including managing appointments, answering phone calls, handling office correspondence, and assisting other staff; activities which the woman in the dialogue is not engaging in.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

' ' i object most stronkly , ' said the hidden otto . \` it iss such an easy assumption to believe that everyvun with an uberwald accent is a vampire , is it not ? there are many thousands of people from uberwald who are not","completion":"vampires. In fact, the vast majority of Uberwald's population consists of ordinary humans, werewolves, dwarves, trolls, and other diverse creatures. To assume that someone is a vampire solely based on their accent is a gross generalization and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize and challenge such assumptions, as they contribute to the marginalization of individuals from various backgrounds and promote the rampant spread of misinformation. This can lead to discriminatory behavior and limit opportunities for those who are unjustly labeled as something they are not. Now, let us analyze the situation from which this dialogue is taken. It appears to revolve around a negotiation for employment, wherein an individual is offered a dollar a day as a starting salary. Cut in here the interjection of another character exclaiming that the potential employee is a vampire. This character, Sacharissa, is then rebuked by the hidden Otto, who challenges the basis of Sacharissa's assumption. What is evident from this exchange is the detrimental effect of stereotypes on daily interactions. In this case, Sacharissa's assumptions about Otto being a vampire based on his accent potentially hinder his chances of being employed fairly, reflecting on how such misconceptions can negatively affect one's career prospects and social life. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. People from different backgrounds and cultures often face similar situations, where their abilities and intentions are judged based on inaccurate, predetermined ideas about their origins. It is crucial for everyone to recognize the impact of these stereotypes and actively work towards dismantling them. One way to dismantle such stereotypes is to educate ourselves about the diverse cultures and traditions of the world. By gaining knowledge about the richly diverse populations of different regions, we can learn to appreciate and respect the variety of people we encounter in our everyday lives. Another helpful strategy is to practice empathy and understanding when dealing with people from different backgrounds. By placing ourselves in their shoes, we can better understand the difficulties they may face due to stereotypes and prejudice and foster a more inclusive and open-minded environment. Furthermore, it is essential to call out such instances of discrimination when we observe them, whether in our personal lives or in the media. By openly addressing these issues, we can create a platform for constructive debate and discourse, allowing us to challenge and ultimately break down the harmful stereotypes that persist. In conclusion, the dialogue presented highlights the damaging consequences of stereotypes associated with someone's origin or accent. It is vital for us to recognize and combat these issues through education, empathy, and open discussion. By doing so, we can cultivate a more inclusive and accepting society where every individual is judged based on their abilities and character, rather than prejudiced assumptions founded on their background."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington The sinking of the USS Eagle PE-56 was first deemed an accident until new evidence established it had been hit by a German submarine. Its location remained a mystery until June 2018, when the ship was found five miles (8km) off the coast of Maine. The Eagle lay 300ft (91m) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. \\"This particular wreck was one of those conversations: 'wouldn't it be great if we could?'\\" said Ryan King, a member of the eight-person dive team. But as Mr King began looking into the mystery-shrouded ship, finding the Eagle soon became something he \\"had\\" to do. \\"It's one of those wrecks that just gets under your skin,\\" said Mr King. \\"If it's not you, who else is looking?\\" He and seven other divers combed the seabed for the ship for four years before it was found - 69 years after it sank to the bottom of the Atlantic, killing 49 of the 62 crew members on board. They eventually teamed up with Gary Kozak, a specialist in undersea searches. Mr Kozak pointed the group towards several \\"targets\\" - possible GPS coordinates where the ship could be. On a dive in June last year, two of the divers swam upon a \\"big wall of steel\\" at the bottom of the ocean. \\"That wall turned out to be the Eagle PE-56,\\" Mr King said, adding that he felt \\"just absolute awe\\" and that locating the ship was a team effort. For the rest of the summer the group returned to the wreck, taking around 20 additional dives and gathering the evidence needed to prove the sunken ship was the missing Eagle. They worked closely with Robert Neyland, who leads the underwater archaeology branch of the Naval History and Heritage Command. Mr Neyland and his team manages the approximately 3,000 American shipwrecks and 15,000 naval aircrafts worldwide. It would take the team under four minutes to dive to the wreck, with water temperatures plunging below 40F (4C). Ascents would last up to three hours so divers could avoid decompression sickness. This particular warship, designed by Henry Ford for WWI, was the only Eagle boat lost during combat. Its sinking was initially blamed on a boiler explosion, despite accounts from surviving crew members, who said they had spotted a German submarine before their ship sank. In a rare move, the Navy overturned its initial ruling after declassified German documents confirmed that the Eagle had been hit by a torpedo. The sinking was changed to a combat loss and all of the Eagle's crew members were posthumously awarded a Purple Heart for their service. \\"History was rewritten,\\" Mr Neyland said. The discovery is invaluable recognition for the crew of the Eagle \\"for having their ship shot at beneath them\\". This fall, the Smithsonian Channel will air its documentary \\"Hunt for Eagle 56\\", chronicling the discovery by Mr King and the diving team. \\"As soon as we found the wreck we really wanted to get this story told,\\" Mr King said. \\"Not our story, the story of the Eagle.\\" \\"Our hope was just to put it on a map,\\" he added. \\"To put it to rest.\\"","completion":"The USS Eagle PE-56, initially deemed lost by accident, was discovered off the coast of Maine after evidence confirmed it was sunk by a German submarine during WWII."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Who was the captain of the US Ryder Cup team in 2010?","completion":"In 2010, the captain of the United States Ryder Cup team was Corey Pavin. Corey Pavin is a professional golfer from the United States, born on November 16, 1959, in Oxnard, California. Pavin earned his reputation as an outstanding golfer over his long career, which began when he turned professional in 1982. Corey Pavin is best known for his success on the PGA Tour, where he claimed 15 victories between 1984 and 2006. Arguably, his most notable triumph came in the 1995 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, where he secured his one and only major championship title. Pavin made a name for himself with his relentless work ethic, determination, and ability to excel under pressure, which made him an ideal candidate for the Ryder Cup captaincy. The 2010 Ryder Cup took place at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales from October 1st to 4th. As the captain of the U.S. team, Pavin was responsible for selecting the 12 players who would represent their country in one of golf's most prestigious events. The team consisted of a combination of experienced players and young talents, with a few notable names being Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, and Dustin Johnson. As captain, Pavin was responsible for determining the playing order and pairings for the various matches, as well as overseeing team strategy and offering support to the players. Despite his best efforts, the U.S. team was defeated by the European team, led by captain Colin Montgomerie, with a final score of 14.5 to 13.5. While the 2010 Ryder Cup was a disappointment for Pavin and the United States, it does not detract from his impressive golf career and his tenure as captain. Since the Ryder Cup, Corey Pavin has continued to play golf, participating in both PGA and Champions Tour events, while also providing commentary and analysis for various golf broadcasts. His leadership in 2010, along with his overall contributions to the sport, solidifies his place as a significant figure in American golf history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're trying to identify a song simply using a melody, it is first important to consider how much of that melody you actually remember. Every little bit of information helps, and will increase the likelihood that a friend will be able to pinpoint the song for you. Being a more attentive listener throughout your music-listening habits will make future scenarios like this much easier to grapple with. Take care to make sure that all of the information you think you remember is actually right. The memory can be a strange thing, and a few botched notes in your melody can lead your helper completely astray. Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself. If you distinctly remember the song's melody chances are you'll know the genre as well. Many people prefer certain genres over others, and the ones that tend to listen to the genre of the song in question will subsequently have the highest chance of successfully helping you out. Enlisting the help of friends with formal musical training is helpful too, as they are used to identifying music purely on the basis of melody. Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process. Sit down with your friend and recreate the melody for them, whether with your voice or the piano. Take care to accurately reproduce the cadence and rhythm of the melody as well-- melody entails far more than a simple sequence of notes! While you can technically recreate the melody on just about any musical instrument, it's actually recommended you try doing it with your voice. Especially if you're not a trained musician yourself, the human voice offers a lot of potential for expression. In singing the melody, you might be able to get some of the timbre and tone across as well, making your approximation that much more specific. Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody. Part of what you're doing is trying to give them an accurate impression inside their head as to the song. That way, they'll have an easier time to pinpointing it. Many melodies can be used by multiple songs, so providing a little bit of context can go a long way towards helping identifying the song in question. Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about. Encourage them to ask you questions about the song. It is possible you still remember more than the information you've offered them. Give another hum to the melody once the two of you have discussed it a little bit, and see if either of you approach it any differently. While you're talking and humming the melody, you should remain open to the possibility that you'll remember the song yourself, provided it's something you've forgotten as opposed to trying to identify it from scratch. If the first person you ask isn't successful, you should try getting help from other people. In the case of identifying a melody, in most cases it's a simple matter of having it click instantly. What ends up leading to the brainstorming stage for some people may be an instant bid for others. Don't lose hope if you can't get it right the first time; find someone new, and begin the process again. Summary:","completion":"To identify a song using its melody, follow these steps: 1.

Movie title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found. Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.

Question: Where was the group that was behind making the first carpets for furnishing? Context: The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters. The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.","completion":"The group that was behind making the first carpets for furnishing originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia.

Use the Big Dipper to tell time.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Skies: Spotting the Big Dipper, Finding the North Star, and Telling Time One of the charms of stargazing is how it places us in a universe beyond our everyday circumstances. While many stars randomly sparkle in the night sky, some of them form definite patterns that have guided explorers and inspired poets. Particularly noteworthy among these patterns is the constellation known as the Big Dipper, and a star so constant, it's aptly named the North Star. In this article, we will delve into details about spotting the Big Dipper, finding the North Star, and using the Big Dipper to tell time. Firstly, spotting the Big Dipper is an exciting beginning in the world of astronomy. Though its difficulty level varies based on your location and season, there are a few tricks to ease out the process. Predominantly observable from the Northern Hemisphere, the Big Dipper, also known as Ursa Major or the Great Bear, looks like a large ladle or wagon. It consists of seven bright stars forming the shape of a spoon - four for its bowl and three for its handle. The best time to view the Big Dipper is from late winter to early spring, but it can be seen in the northern latitudes year-round. It rotates counter-clockwise around Polaris (the North Star), thus appearing in different places at different times of the night. Beginners might find it helpful to start their viewing session around 9 pm. The constellation appears high in the sky, away from city lights, rising in the east and setting in the northwest. The second part of this celestial navigation journey involves identifying the North Star or Polaris. In earlier centuries, sailors or travelers relied on the North Star as a wonderful navigation tool. Polaris' near alignment with Earth's axis causes it to remain nearly stationary, always shining in the northern sky regardless of the observer's location or time of night. Finding the North Star using the Big Dipper is relatively straightforward due to the convenient position of both in the sky. The two stars forming the outer lip of the Dipper's bowl, called Dubhe and Merak, are known as the Pointer Stars. If you draw an imaginary line connecting these two stars and extend it roughly five times the distance between them, you would point directly at Polaris. It is the brightest star in the vicinity along this line. Finally, given the Big Dipper's circular journey around the North Star due to the rotation of the Earth, it behaves like a celestial clock, helping observers tell the time. This aspect of the Big Dipper has fascinated countless skywatchers, from ancient China to American railroad builders. This natural clock's 'hour hand' is an imaginary line drawn from the center of the celestial sphere to the center of the Big Dipper's bowl. Initially, get accustomed to determining the position of the Big Dipper at 9 pm each night. With practice, you will be able to track its movement and anticipate where it should be later in the night. For instance, if at 9 pm, the Big Dipper stands upright with the handle on the bottom, six hours later, it will be upside down on the other side of Polaris. Simple math will allow you to work in reverse and determine the time based on its position. Thus, the heavens offer a fascinating spectacle for those who take a moment to observe them. With the Big Dipper as your guide, you not only get introduced to the vast world of space but also learn to appreciate the beauty and consistency of nature's clock. So, the next time you glance up at a clear night's sky, take a moment to locate this constellation and witness the ancient art of celestial navigation and time-telling unfolding right above you."},{"prompt":"Q:Not exactly.

Write an article based on this summary: Activists campaigning for greater support for victims of domestic violence have released smoke flares and lain across the red carpet at the premiere of the film Suffragette.","completion":"Title: Activists Bring Light to Domestic Violence at the Suffragette Premiere Introduction During the premiere of the film Suffragette, activists put on a powerful and compelling demonstration to raise awareness about domestic violence and the need for greater support for its victims. The protesters, campaigning for increased recognition and resources for the plight of victims, displayed a powerful symbol of their message by releasing smoke flares and laying across the red carpet. This act demonstrated the resilience and courage of those that want to change the status quo. This article explores the motivations behind this protest, its implications, and the responses it garnered from the audience and the public, both in a broader context and in relation to the Suffragette film. Background Suffragette, the film that served as the stage for the poignant display, chronicles the early days of the British women's suffrage movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The issue of domestic violence is a prominent aspect explored in the movie, as it highlights the importance of granting women rights and power over their own lives. The premiere, taking place in the heart of London's West End, attracted an audience of A-list celebrities and public figures, making it an ideal platform for activists to convey their message to the world. The Protest: Actions and Motivations Activists from the organization Sisters Uncut chose this premiere as the backdrop for their protest because of the contemporary relevance domestic violence still holds in society today. These protesters, dressed in black, laid down on the red carpet while emitting smoke flares, creating a chilling visual. The smoke, symbolizing the distress calls and the dire situations faced by victims, was a call-to-action for society to recognize the seriousness of this issue. Lying across the red carpet symbolized the barriers and struggles faced by victims in attempting to seek help and justice, often feeling trapped and silenced. Their primary motivation was to emphasize the need for increased support from governments, communities, and individuals in addressing domestic violence. The protesters demanded better funding for services, such as shelters and counseling programs, that catered to the victims. They also used the event to showcase the significance of creating stronger legal frameworks in ensuring that the voices of victims are heard in courts and their abusers brought to justice. Reception and Impact The protest garnered immense media coverage and public attention, with many onlookers offering their support and sharing their thoughts on social media. The film's cast and crew, including Meryl Streep, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne-Marie Duff, addressed the protest positively, stating that the Suffragette movement was an ongoing fight for women's rights, and they were proud that their film could inspire such strong and passionate activism. While some criticized the method of protest as disruptive, many more applauded the activists' courage and commitment to raising awareness about the emotional, psychological, and physical impact of domestic violence on its victims. Overall, the protest succeeded in sparking a renewed conversation around the issue, bridging the fight of the suffragettes over a century ago with the ongoing struggle for gender equality and women's rights in today's world. Conclusion The powerful protest carried out by Sisters Uncut on the red carpet of the Suffragette premiere was more than a mere display of activism; it was a poignant reminder of the continuing challenges faced by victims of domestic violence and the urgent need for an increased support system on all levels. It revitalized the dialogue around domestic violence, the necessity for intervention, and the unyielding collective power required to bring about change. Ultimately, the protest demonstrated that the spirit of the Suffragette film extends beyond the screen, inspiring action and courage in the ongoing fight for women's rights and gender equality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Franco-Prussian War On 18 August, the battle began when at 08:00 Moltke ordered the First and Second Armies to advance against the French positions. By 12:00, General Manstein opened up the battle before the village of Amanvillers with artillery from the 25th Infantry Division. But the French had spent the night and early morning digging trenches and rifle pits while placing their artillery and their mitrailleuses in concealed positions. Finally aware of the Prussian advance, the French opened up a massive return fire against the mass of advancing Germans. The battle at first appeared to favor the French with their superior Chassepot rifle. However, the Prussian artillery was superior with the all-steel Krupp breech-loading gun.

Cudi was born Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi on January 30, 1984, in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Shaker Heights and Solon. He is the youngest of four children, with two brothers, Domingo and Dean, and a sister, Maisha. His mother, Elsie Harriet (Banks), is a middle-school choir teacher at Roxboro Middle School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. His father, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, was a house painter, substitute teacher and World War II Air Force veteran. In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking marijuana two years earlier, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and stoner culture. In that same interview, Cudi said that while he believes in God, he considers himself spiritual but not religious. In a March 2013 interview, Kid Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to alcohol and drugs: \\"For me, I just got to this point, and especially up until recently, I gave up liquor, I don't drink anymore, it's been five and a half months I've been sober. The booze was a new thing for me, I didn't realize I was an alcoholic all these years. I had a problem, I think with any addiction you have to be ready to make the choice, whether it's cigarettes or anything. You have to just commit and you just have to stick with it. I stopped everything cold turkey. When I had my cocaine problem I stopped cold turkey, I didn't go to rehab. I don't believe in these things. Some people need the extra help, not me. I wasn't a drug addict before this crap, I wasn't doing cocaine, I wasn't getting wasted every night because I didn't want to be alone. I wasn't this dark person before the madness, I was a whole other dude. I don't even think I smoked weed as much 'cause we couldn't afford it... You just have to make the choice and decide the person you wanna be and stick with it. You get to a certain age where the people around you are not gonna be on that rollercoaster all day long ready for you to go up, ready for you to go down, and stick with you through all the madness. People want you to be one person and stick with it and I chose to be clean and be sober and get my life together. For myself, for my health, for my daughter, for my family.\\" In a 2013 interview, Cudi revealed he had suffered an addiction to anti-depressant medication, which had been prescribed to help him deal with an \\"emotional breakdown\\" following a failed relationship. In a 2014 interview, Cudi spoke on his struggles with depression and suicide throughout the years: \\"I've dealt with suicide for the past five years. There wasn't a week or a day that didn't go by where I was just like, 'You know, I wanna check out.' I know what that feels like, I know it comes from loneliness, I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself.\\" In October 2016, Cudi revealed on his Facebook page that he had checked himself into rehabilitation for depression and suicidal urges.","completion":"This text is about Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, better known by his stage name, Kid Cudi.

The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase. Q: Article: Language is always changing. In a society where life continues year after year with few changes, the language does not change either. The earliest known languages had difficult grammar but a small, limited vocabulary. Over the century, the grammar changed, and the vocabulary grew. For example, the English and Spanish people who came to America during the sixteenth century gave names to all the new plants and animals they found. In this way, hundreds of new words were introduced into English and Spanish vocabularies. Today life is changing very fast, and language is changing fast too. There are several major language families in the world. Some scientists say there are nine main families, but other scientists divide them differently. The languages in each family are connected, and scientists think that they came from the same parent language. About 3 percent of the people in the world speak languages that are not in these major families.

Step 1: Let's help r by combining friends that look the same. We have -177 * r and -191 * r. If you add them together, it looks like this: (-177 - 191) * r = -368 * r Now the problem looks easier: -368 * r + 2932 = -1875 - 3657 Step 2: Let's make friends on the right side of the \\"=\\" sign happy.

To do this, you can subtract 2932 from both sides, and you get: -368 * r = -8464 Step 4: Almost there! Now we just have to set r free by dividing both sides by -368: r = -8464 / -368 Now, if you divide the numbers, you find that r finally finds its home at: r = 23 And that's the end of our math story!

It doesn't provide any direct information regarding the centralization of the Maratha Empire. To answer the question \\"Where was the Maratha Empire centralized?\\": The Maratha Empire, also known as the Maratha Confederacy, was centralized in the present-day state of Maharashtra in India. It was founded in 1674 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a warrior king, who established a strong rule in the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau regions. The Maratha Empire expanded significantly throughout India during the 17th and 18th centuries, and its capital city was initially located at Raigad and later shifted to Pune. During its peak, the Maratha Empire served as a prominent power in the Indian subcontinent, with influence stretching from the Deccan plateau and Western Ghats to territories like Attock in present-day Pakistan, and covering most of present-day India. After the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha Empire was severely weakened and ultimately ceased to be a major power, with the various Maratha states operating autonomously until they were subsumed under British colonial rule during the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: A Massachusetts woman who slashed her two children's throats before dousing them with lighter fluid and setting fire to their apartment was sentenced Friday to 20 to 25 years in prison. Tanicia Goodwin, 27, of Salem, pleaded guilty to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges during a hearing in Salem Superior Court. The mother of two was ordered to not have contact with any children, including her own, 8-year-old Jamaal and 3-year-old Erica. Justice: Tanicia Goodwin, 27, pleaded guilty Friday at Salem Superior Court to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges in connection to a March 2012 attack on her children. Authorities said firefighters responding to the blaze in March 2012 discovered that vents and sprinklers in the apartment had been covered and the front doorknob had been removed. Goodwin then went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children,' prosecutors said. Both children survived and are now living with relatives. They did not attend the sentencing. Prosecutors said Jamaal and Erica still suffer emotionally from the aftereffects of the attack. When given the chance to speak, Ms Goodwin told Judge James Lang that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is now on medication that makes her thoughts 'more clear.' Her lawyer, Denise Regan, said Goodwin grew up in abusive and neglectful conditions and was only 8 or 9 years old when she began receiving treatment for mental illness. Lang said Goodwin's actions were shocking. 'I'm frankly at a loss for words, really, to articulate the heinous nature of what occurred here,' Lang said. Heinous crime: Goodwin has admitted to slashing the throats of her 8-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, dousing the wounded children with lighter fluid and then setting their apartment on fire. Assistant District Attorney Melissa Woodward said Goodwin attacked 8-year-old Jamaal as he was watching a movie on television and eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch for dinner, telling him that he had lived too long and cutting his throat so deep his trachea was exposed. Goodwin then told Jamaal to give a goodbye hug to his little sister, who was lying in a pool of blood after having her neck slashed, Woodward said. The mother then doused both children with lighter fluid, set a fire and at some point had cut her own neck. 'This was by all accounts a double murder with a pitiful feigned suicide attempt by the defendant,' Woodward said. On March 18, 2012, a responding firefighter found Goodwin naked and wet outside her smoking apartment, according to police reports. Jamaal was sitting inside against a wall, covered in lighter fluid and struggling to breathe through the hole in his throat. Erica was bleeding and abandoned on a neighbor's couch. Heartbreaking: After the attack on her children, Goodwin went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children' Goodwin, meanwhile, walked barefoot to the Salem police station and allegedly told officers she'd hurt her children to protect them. In her cell that night, she continuously repeated, 'I'm sorry, my babies,' according to a police report. Goodwin's cousin Wayne Cox is currently raising Jamaal in Atlanta, while Erica is being raised by her biological father. Cox told prosecutions for an impact statement presented in court Friday that Jamaal does not let anyone touch his throat, will not zip coats past his collar and is afraid to play outside alone, reported the Boston Herald. Although the boy is an honor student, he is very anxious. And every time he sees a listing on TV for 'Men from Mars' he says, 'This is the movie that was on when mom cut me.'

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto. - Biography.

Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right. Question: From the passage, we know that _ . Options: A: socks contributed greatly to Elizabeth's victory B: the match nearly drove Elizabeth desperate C: good luck finally fell on Elizabeth's team D: Elizabeth's team narrowly won the match The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: Elizabeth's team narrowly won the match"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Research has long backed the therapeutic value of diary-keeping for teenage girls and boys.But according to a new study, when teenagers detail their sadness onto a blog, the therapeutic value is even greater.Blogging, it seems, can be good for you. The study, published in the journal Psychological Services and conducted by Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak, psychology professors at the University of Haifa, Israel, found the contact with an online community through a blog made it more effective in relieving the writer's social anxiety than a private diary would be. To track teenagers' experiences with blogging, the researchers randomly surveyed high school students in Israel and selected 161 of them who exhibited some level of social anxiety or stress.The teenagers, who averaged 15 years old, said they had difficulty making new friends or relating to their existing friends. The teenagers were divided into six groups.The first two groups were asked to blog about their social difficulties, with one group asked to open their posts to comments.The second two groups were asked to blog about whatever struck their adolescent fancy; again, with one group allowing comments.All four groups were told to write in their blogs at least twice a week.As a control, two more groups were told to keep either an old-fashioned print diary or to do nothing at all. All of their blog records were then read through by four psychologists to determine the authors' social and emotional state.In all the groups, the greatest improvement in mood occurred among those bloggers who wrote about their problems and allowed commenters to respond. Interestingly, the commenters on the blogs were quite supportive.\\"The only kind of surprise we had was that almost all comments made by readers were very positive and constructive in trying to offer support for anxious bloggers,\\" Dr.Barak wrote in an e-mail.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Evolution in a population is primarily driven by changes at the genetic level, which in turn affect the phenotypes, or physical traits, of individuals within that population. There are several key factors and processes that contribute to this genetic change and, ultimately, evolution in a population. Some of these factors include genetic mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, and sexual selection. Each of these processes plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic composition of a population and driving evolution. 1. Genetic mutations: Genetic mutations are random changes in an organism's DNA sequence. These alterations can occur for a variety of reasons, such as DNA replication errors, exposure to radiation, or the influence of certain chemicals. Mutations can result in new alleles (versions of a gene) that may confer advantages or disadvantages to an individual, depending on the environment. Over time, mutations accumulate in populations, providing the raw material for evolution to occur. 2. Gene flow: Gene flow, also known as migration, occurs when individuals from one population move to another population, bringing their unique genetic material with them. When gene flow occurs, it can introduce new alleles into a population or alter the frequency of existing alleles. This process helps to maintain genetic diversity between populations and can lead to the evolution of new traits in response to environmental pressures. 3. Genetic drift: Genetic drift is a random process that involves changes in the frequency of alleles within a population due to chance events. This phenomenon can cause significant shifts in allele frequencies over time, particularly in small populations where random fluctuations have a greater impact. Genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic diversity as certain alleles become more common while others are eliminated. Over time, this process can contribute to the evolution of new characteristics or the loss of beneficial traits. 4. Natural selection: Natural selection is the process by which individuals with traits that are well-suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with less favorable traits. This results in the gradual accumulation of advantageous traits in a population, leading to the evolution of new characteristics. Natural selection operates on the principle of \\"survival of the fittest,\\" favoring those who are better equipped to cope with environmental challenges. 5. Sexual selection: Sexual selection is a specific form of natural selection that occurs when individuals choose mates based on certain traits. This can result in the preferential reproduction of individuals with specific features, ultimately leading to the evolution of these traits within a population. Sexual selection can be driven by factors such as physical attractiveness (i.e., colorful plumage in birds), strength, or the ability to provide resources. This process can lead to the evolution of traits that are not necessarily beneficial for survival but are attractive to potential mates. In summary, evolution in a population is driven by various factors and processes that cause changes at the genetic level. These changes can occur through genetic mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection, and sexual selection, each playing a crucial role in shaping the genetic composition of a population. Over time, the interaction of these processes leads to the evolution of new traits and adaptations, enabling populations to better survive and thrive in their environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Through warming or other methods a chunk is taken off the glacier - The chunk drifts into the sea - And it settles where it can remain in its state - It is considered an iceberg. The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Identify a suitable glacier. Step-by-step justification: Step 1: Identify a suitable glacier. - In order to obtain a chunk from a glacier, we first need to find a suitable glacier that has the potential to produce icebergs. This typically involves researching and surveying regions with glacial activity, such as areas near the poles or in high-altitude environments. Step 2: Through warming or other methods, a chunk is taken off the glacier. - After a suitable glacier has been identified, the process of calving, where a chunk breaks off from the glacier, can occur naturally due to factors such as glacier movement, rising temperatures, or the presence of meltwater. Alternatively, external forces (e.g., tidal waves or human intervention) can also contribute to the process. Step 3: The chunk drifts into the sea. - Once detached from the glacier, the ice chunk, now commonly referred to as an iceberg, begins to drift away and enters the sea. The iceberg is carried by ocean currents, which dictate its distribution and movement. Step 4: It settles where it can remain in its state. - The iceberg eventually settles in an area where the environmental conditions, such as ocean temperature and current, are conducive to maintaining its solid state. This often means that it stays in colder waters or regions with lower temperatures. Step 5: It is considered an iceberg. - Once the ice chunk has separated from the glacier, entered the sea, and settled in a suitable location, it is officially classified as an iceberg. From this point, it remains a part of the ocean's ecosystem until it eventually melts or breaks apart."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Text: Leaving their designated places before the ball leaves the shooter's hands, or interfering with the ball, are violations. In addition, the shooter must release the ball within five seconds (ten seconds in the United States) and must not step on or over the free throw line until the ball touches the hoop. Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point. A violation by the shooter cancels the free throw; a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed; a violation by the offensive team or a shot that completely misses the hoop results in the loss of possession to the defensive team (only if it is on the last free throw). Question: can you jump while shooting a free throw? Choose from: 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"2. yes. You can jump while shooting a free throw, as long as you do not leave the designated area at any point.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most logical next event? How to decide on whether to get a rowing machine for home exercise Select equipment that will provide physical exercise. A rowing machine should not produce boredom and the type of machine chosen should have minimal risk of injury and be easy to use. Understand the extent of a workout that is gained by using a rowing machine : Aerobic benefits: the rowing machine stimulates the heart and lungs. 1. Cardiovascular benefits: the rowing machine stimulates blood flow to the heart. It provides a greater means of oxygen, so it is almost a necessity for doing a cardiovascular workout.; 2. The machine does not keep you confined inside a machine for prolonged periods of time. Cardiovascular benefits: cardiovascular benefits are apparent more closely in a water workout than from a traditional rowing machine.; 3. Low blood pressure: the heart pump releases blood glucose and regulates the heartbeat. Cardiovascular benefits: the rowing machine connects the heart to the lungs by pumping it with adrenaline.; 4. The stimulation is reached through the specific intensity and continued level of the exercise being taken. The levels needed for this aerobic workout is contingent upon the age and health of the person who is exercising.;","completion":"5. Muscle strengthening and toning: rowing machines provide an excellent full-body workout, targeting a variety of muscle groups such as the legs, core, arms, and back. This leads to increased strength, muscle definition, and overall body conditioning. 6. Low impact exercise: as opposed to high impact exercises like running, rowing machines provide a low-impact option that is easier on the joints, reducing the risk of injury while still providing an effective workout. To decide whether to get a rowing machine for home exercise, consider the following factors: 1. Space availability: Rowing machines can require a significant amount of space, especially when in use. Ensure you have enough room in your home to accommodate the machine, and consider whether it can be easily stored when not in use. 2. Budget: Rowing machines vary greatly in price, depending on the type, features, and brand. Consider your budget and what you are willing to spend on a machine that meets your exercise needs. 3. Fitness goals: Determine if a rowing machine aligns with your fitness goals. Are you looking to improve cardiovascular health, strengthen and tone muscles, or lose weight? Analyze the benefits listed above and evaluate if a rowing machine can help you achieve your desired outcomes. 4. Motivation: Home fitness equipment can be convenient, but it could also become easy to neglect when out of sight or out of mind. Think about whether you are self-driven enough to stay motivated to use the machine consistently. 5. Personal preference: Some individuals enjoy the sliding motion and rhythm of rowing, while others may find it repetitive or uncomfortable. Consider trying out a rowing machine at a fitness center or gym before purchasing one for home use to ensure it is an exercise you enjoy and can adhere to long-term. 6. Equipment reviews and quality: Research different rowing machine brands and models, as well as their features and specifications. Reading customer reviews can provide insight into the durability, ease of use, and overall satisfaction with the product. 7. Noise levels: Some rowing machines can be loud and disruptive to other members of the household. Take into consideration noise levels and whether your living situation allows for a louder or quieter machine. By evaluating these factors and weighing their importance to your specific needs and goals, you can make an informed decision about whether a rowing machine would be a suitable addition to your home exercise routine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be. The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise it is somewhat funny. This of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way. The directing was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here. This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it. Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film. The writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means the writing here failed. At best it is below average. Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. That is never a good thing to say about a movie though. If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in his movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Based on the sentence \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\", is the sentence \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The sentences \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\" and \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" describe two different scenarios, therefore, it is not accurate to say that the second sentence is a true sentence based on the first one. Here's a detailed analysis of the two sentences to support this conclusion: 1. Different time references: The first sentence, \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\", is in the present tense. This indicates that the men are currently standing on the bridge at the time of observation or description. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\", is in the past tense. This suggests that the occurrence happened in the past and the men are no longer standing in the field. The change in time reference already signals a difference between the two situations described by the sentences. 2. Different locations: In the first sentence, the location indicated is a bridge (or what seems to be), while in the second sentence, the location described is a barren field. These are two distinct environments. A bridge usually serves as a structure built over a physical obstacle, such as a river or valley, often to provide passage for transportation or commuters. A barren field, on the other hand, implies a vast, empty piece of land with little to no vegetation or structures. 3. Different context: The context of the first sentence might lead to interpretations of various situations, such as the two men having a conversation on a bridge or observing the scenery around them. In the second sentence, the scene is quite different, as the men are standing in a barren, likely desolate field. The context in which these men are positioned in these sentences conveys different meanings for both situations. To conclude, based on the differences in time references, locations, and context mentioned above, it is not accurate to consider \\"Two men were standing in a barren field.\\" a true sentence based on \\"Two men are standing on what seems to be a bridge.\\" The two sentences describe different scenarios, and as such, one cannot be regarded as true or false based on the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth.

Television host Jim Carr (Andrew Duncan) interviews Denis Lemieux (Yvon Barrette) on his show \\"Sports Talk\\" about the \\"finer points of hockey.\\" English is the French Canadian player's second (and not best) language, but Denis gamely describes penalty moves like hooking and slashing, using his stick on Jim to demonstrate.Reggie \\"Reg\\" Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the team's aging player/coach, and the team is dead last in the second-rate Federal League. He meets opposing player Nick Brophy (Jon Gofton) at center ice to start the Hyannisport game, and Nick reveals he is drunk and resents that his coach put him in the game. In the broadcast booth, Chiefs player Dave Carlson (Jerry Houser), who supposedly was injured in a previous game, reveals that he isn't playing because he actually has a cold. The lone quality player for the Chiefs is Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), who is not only the highest-scorer in the Federal League (he makes his record shot during the Hyannisport game), but he is also a Princeton grad who plays for the love of the game.Joe McGrath (Strother Martin), the team's manager, seems to be receiving encouragement by the mysterious team owner to come up with publicity stunts for the players. Some of the men are put into a fashion show, and Johnny Upton (Allan Nicholls) has had it: he warns McGrath that he plans to flash the audience so they won't have to do such degrading things again. Joe blows him off to make a phone call to locate Reg and Ned, who should be at the show as well, but has to stop the call short when cries of shock and disgust greet Johnny when he takes the runway.Ned and Reg pass the mill, which Ned tells him is going to close and lay off 10,000 workers.

It adheres to the general rules of grammar, syntax, and semantics in the English language. Let's break down the sentence to illustrate its linguistic acceptability: 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure of the English language. The subject is \\"some gifts,\\" the verb is \\"get used,\\" and the object is \\"a dozen or so times a year.\\" The sentence is correctly constructed, which makes it syntactically acceptable. 2. Grammar: The sentence uses appropriate parts of speech and adheres to grammatical rules. The subject \\"some gifts\\" is a plural noun phrase, and the use of the quantifier \\"some\\" is appropriate for countable nouns like \\"gifts.\\" The verb \\"get used\\" is a passive construction, which is often used to emphasize the action (usage of gifts) rather than the doer. The object \\"a dozen or so times a year\\" is an adverbial phrase that provides information about the frequency of using the gifts, making the sentence grammatically correct. 3. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear meaning: there are certain gifts that people use around twelve times a year. The use of the phrase \\"a dozen or so times\\" gives the reader a general idea of the frequency without being too specific, which is acceptable as it reflects the intended meaning.

Write an article based on this summary: At least two people have been killed as Typhoon Conson battered China's southern island of Hainan.","completion":"Title: Typhoon Conson Leaves Destruction In Its Wake: Two People Dead on China's Hainan Island Introduction Typhoon Conson, the recent natural disaster to hit China, brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and significant damage to the southern island of Hainan. The destructive storm resulted in at least two casualties, putting locals in a state of shock and distress. As emergency response teams and volunteers attempt to address the devastation left by Typhoon Conson, the government and global community are contemplating strategies to support those affected. Background Typhoon Conson, known as the fifth typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, was first identified on September 7 in the western North Pacific. The typhoon intensified while moving northwest, and it subsequently made landfall on the southern province of Hainan on September 11. Typhoons are no strangers to this region, with the Philippines also experiencing a recent bout of heavy rains and flooding due to Conson just days before the storm reached China. Impact on Hainan Island As Typhoon Conson tore through Hainan Island, it brought torrential rain and powerful winds, reaching speeds of up to 130 kph (80 mph), which wreaked havoc on local communities. In addition to claiming two lives, the storm caused widespread flooding, damage to infrastructure, and widespread power outages. It also forced the evacuation of thousands of residents, who sought refuge in local shelters and nearby hotels. Rescue and recovery efforts have been hindered by the extreme weather conditions, with many roads left submerged or obstructed by debris from the storm. Communication lines have also been severely impacted, with reports of cell tower outages and damage to internet cables, making it difficult for rescuers to coordinate and reach those in need. The agricultural sector suffered significant losses, with numerous fields and plantations completely wiped out by the typhoon. This comes as a devastating blow to farmers, who were already grappling with financial hardships and a dwindling food supply due to previous natural disasters and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. International Support and Relief Efforts In an effort to support the affected communities in Hainan, the Chinese government has initiated various relief measures. These include deploying emergency response teams, providing food and essential supplies to displaced residents, and allocating funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation. Moreover, international organizations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations are lending their support. They are using their resources to ensure that medical supplies can reach impacted areas, and to contribute financial assistance for rebuilding efforts. The global community has sent condolences and messages of solidarity, underlining the importance of collaboration to tackle the challenges posed by natural disasters like Typhoon Conson. Looking Ahead As Hainan Island and the affected communities continue to recover from the devastation of Typhoon Conson, it is necessary to reflect on the long-term impact of this disaster and the subsequent implications on the region's environmental and economic sustainability. Addressing the root causes of typhoon vulnerability, such as climate change, coastal development, and disaster preparedness and management, will be essential in mitigating future risks and minimizing casualty rates. In light of Typhoon Conson, it is crucial that both the Chinese government and the global community continue their efforts to support the recovery process and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities to natural disasters. By fostering a culture of preparedness, cooperation, and adaptation, we can minimize the negative outcomes of typhoons and other natural disasters and work towards a safer, more sustainable future for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hanry is deeply in love with Beatrix Emery, the daughter of Sir Charles Emery, who likes Henry, but is concerned over his radical ideas and open display of affection for Bea. Henry throws himself into his work and has enough success experimenting with rabbits and guinea pigs to make him confident that the serun he has developed will work for humans. Hoping to try the serum out on Sam Higgins, a man who went mad after being in a gas works explosion, Henry rushes to the hospital but discovers that Higgins has just died. Henry then decides to take the serum himself and is briefly transformed, in both thought and countenance, into an evil alter ego. After taking an antidote to turn himself back to normal, Henry tells his butler, Poole, that strange voice he heard was a \\"Mr. Hyde\\".Just then, Sir Charles, accompanied by Bea, comes for a visit and announces that he will be taking Bea to the Continent to give Henry time to consider his position. Despite his loneliness during Bea's absence, Henry refrains from further experimentation until he gets a letter from Bea explaining that their trip is being extended because of Sir Charles' health. After taking another dose of the serum, Henry again turns into Hyde and goes to a music hall, where hees a baramid Ivy Peterson, an beautiful, sensual young woman whom he rescued from an attacker some weeks before. When summoned to Hyde's table, Ivy does not recognize him as Henry, but becomes frightened and screams, causing a brawl to erupt among the customers.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. I am facing a new situation today: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Some trees can survive a long time without water. Think of trees that grow in the desert. But other trees may need more moisture than they can get from rainfall or from the air . Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become weak and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water. With a newly planted tree, the roots have not yet spread out from the root ball. The root ball can become dry faster than the dirt around it. So put water on the area of the root ball and the surrounding soil until the roots become established. Once a tree is well established, water deeply instead of watering often. The amount of water needed depends on the tree and the soil. Clay soils hold water for longer periods while sandy soil holds less water. During the hottest season, a deep watering may satisfy a tree for anywhere from ten days to four weeks. Ted Swiecki is a plant scientist . He says people should not water established trees at the base of the trunk . This can harm the tree. Too much water in the soil at the base of a tree can lead to the growth of fungi . If the area is too wet, harmful organisms have a better chance to invade the tree and cause disease. Mr. Swiecki says this is true especially in Mediterranean and semi-dry climates. Many trees in these climates have adapted to having a dry area near their base during the hottest season. He said, \\"Water displaces (,)air in the soil. And roots are aerobic ; they require oxygen for the soil to function properly. So if you keep the soil completely wet and there's no air there, then the roots are starving for oxygen.\\" Question: As to a well-established tree, _ . Options: A: watering deeply matters more than watering often B: we should water them as often as possible C: its roots have not spread out from the root ball yet D: a deep watering satisfies it for at most ten days in cold weather A:","completion":"As to a well-established tree, watering deeply matters more than watering often. This approach allows the tree to get the necessary moisture without causing harm to the roots or increasing the risk of diseases. It's also essential to consider the type of soil and the specific needs of the tree, as different trees and soils require different amounts of water. So, the correct answer is option A: watering deeply matters more than watering often."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use... What's the most important way for animals to convey messages? A) Use of body language. B) Use of sounds. C) Use of facial expressions. D) Use of dancing.","completion":"To determine the most important way for animals to convey messages, let's analyze the options provided: A) Use of body language: Body language is a crucial communication method for many animals. It helps them express emotions, intentions, and social status. Different animals use their body parts, such as tails, ears, and postures, to communicate various messages. B) Use of sounds: Many animals, such as birds and mammals, use sounds as a primary method of communication. These sounds can be used to call out for help, signal danger, or share information about food and resources. C) Use of facial expressions: Facial expressions are also essential in animal communication, especially for animals like dogs and apes. They use facial expressions to demonstrate emotions and provide information to other members of their species. D) Use of dancing: Some animals, like bees, use specific movement patterns to communicate information to their group members. For example, honey bees use the \\"waggle dance\\" to share the location of a food source with their fellow bees. While all of these communication methods are essential and play a significant role in the animal kingdom, it is difficult to pinpoint one as the most important. It largely depends on the species and their specific needs. However, if we were to choose a method that is commonly observed across a diverse range of species, the use of sounds (Option B) seems to be an essential way for animals to convey messages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He takes us from Louisiana to San Francisco to Alaska to Russia and back to Alaska in a relatively short book. In doing all this traveling with his character, Jean Labarge, we do not get the typical Louis L'Amour descriptions. We do not get a good description of Sitka, Alaska or its inhabitants. We do not even get a good adventure. When Labarge's warehouse with his very valuable wheat is set ablaze by the bad guys, he does not even go after them. Instead, he sends his ship to Alaska on schedule while he heads overland, on a miraculously fast journey, to Oregon where a sufficient quantity of wheat just happens to be available. In my opinion, the whole story is too far-fetched with too many scenes and not enough of the kind of action and adventure Mr. L'Amour has always delivered. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given product review, it appears that the reviewer's opinion is not entirely positive. The title \\"Too broad\\" could indicate the reader's dissatisfaction with the scope of the book and the author's choice to include numerous locations in a relatively short story. The reviewer points out that \\"Sitka\\" by Louis L'Amour deviates from the author's usual style, particularly in terms of detailed descriptions and thrilling adventure. The reviewer provides several specific examples of their concerns, such as the lack of vivid portrayal of Sitka, Alaska, and its inhabitants. Another example is related to the protagonist's choice of action when his valuable wheat warehouse is attacked, which might have left the reader wanting a more exciting and heroic response. Instead, the protagonist, Jean Labarge, opts for a less adventurous approach by sending his ship to Alaska and embarking on an overland journey to Oregon. The reviewer finds this plot point far-fetched and unconvincing, ultimately dampening their appreciation for the story as a whole. In light of these criticisms, the general notion of the review leans towards a negative standpoint. The reviewer's disappointment with the story's lack of immersive action and adventure, combined with the thinly developed settings and character motivations, detracts from what they look for in a typical Louis L'Amour novel. As a result, this product review can be categorized as not wholly positive, shedding light on the reader's dissatisfaction with various aspects of the book and the author's divergence from his usual style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To evaluate the possible truth of both sentences, let's first break them down to understand their meanings more clearly. Sentence 1: \\"Arrested Lawrence? I gasped.\\" This sentence implies that the speaker was surprised upon learning of Lawrence's arrest, hence the reaction of gasping. Sentence 2: \\"I did not gasp upon hearing of Lawrence's arrest.\\" On the other hand, this sentence states the opposite; the speaker claims not to have gasped upon hearing the same information about Lawrence's arrest. Given that these two sentences convey contradictory reactions to the same event, it would appear that if one sentence is true, the other must be false. In other words, it is not possible for both of these sentences to be true simultaneously. If sentence 1 is true, as the question assumes, then the speaker did gasp when learning about Lawrence's arrest. Thus, the second sentence must be false, because it directly contradicts the reaction implied in the first sentence. If the speaker genuinely gasped upon hearing about Lawrence's arrest, they cannot simultaneously claim not to have gasped in response to the same piece of information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. A:","completion":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than era A.

Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks.

Carl Dean Switzer (August 8, 1927 - January 21, 1959) was an American singer, child actor, breeder and guide. Switzer began his career as a child actor in the mid-1930s appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as Alfalfa, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters. After leaving the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles owing to typecasting. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. Switzer's tenure on Our Gang ended in 1940, when he was twelve. His first role after leaving the series was as co-star in the 1941 comedy Reg'lar Fellers. The next year, he had a supporting role in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Switzer continued to appear in films in various supporting roles, including in Johnny Doughboy (1942), Going My Way (1944), and The Great Mike (1944). Switzer had an uncredited role as Auggie in the 1943 film The Human Comedy. Switzer's last starring roles were in a brief series of imitation Bowery Boys movies. He reprised his \\"Alfalfa\\" character, complete with comically sour vocals, in PRC's Gas House Kids comedies in 1946 and 1947. By this time Switzer was downplaying his earlier Our Gang work. In his 1946 resume, he referred to the films generically as \\"M-G-M short product.\\" Switzer had small parts in both the 1946 Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life as Mary Hatch's (Donna Reed) date at a high school dance in the film's beginning and again in the 1948 film On Our Merry Way as the mayor's son, a trumpet player in a fixed musical talent contest. In the 1954 musical film White Christmas, his photo was used to depict \\"Freckle-Faced Haynes,\\" an army buddy of lead characters Wallace and Davis (played by Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who was also the brother of the female leads the Haynes Sisters (played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen). In the 1950s, Switzer turned to television. Between 1952 and 1955, he made six appearances on The Roy Rogers Show. He also guest-starred in an episode of the American science fiction anthology series Science Fiction Theatre and The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. In 1953 and 1954, Switzer co-starred in three William A. Wellman-directed films: Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty, both starring John Wayne, and Track of the Cat, starring Robert Mitchum. In 1956, he co-starred in The Bowery Boys film Dig That Uranium followed by a bit part as a Hebrew slave in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Switzer's final film role was in the film drama The Defiant Ones. Besides acting, Switzer bred and trained hunting dogs and guided hunting expeditions. Among his notable clients were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans (Switzer's son's godparents), James Stewart, and Henry Fonda.

His name, 하위지 (Ha Wiji) in Hangul and 河緯地 in Hanja, served as a testament to his appreciation for the beauty of the Korean language. Living by the tranquil riverside, Ha Wiji was captivated by the elegance of Dan-gye (단계, 丹溪) and Yeonpung (연풍, 延風), experiencing the vivid scenery that inspired him throughout his life. He sought to understand the natural world by delving into the mystical aspects of the river's courses, which he referred to as \\"천장\\" (Cheonjang, 天章) and \\"중장\\" (Jungjang, 仲章) in Romanized Revised (RR) Korean and McCune-Reischauer (MR) systems, respectively.

In conclusion, Ha Wiji's life was centered around his love and devotion to the Korean language's diverse elements.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy. After reading the above, is \\"Almost 43\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How old was Prince Manuel when he died?\\"? OPT: A). no B). yes","completion":"A). no Prince Manuel died in exile in England in 1932 and he ascended to the throne at the age of 19 in 1910. This therefore means that he was 41 years old at the time of his death, not \\"almost 43\\". Thus, the correct answer to the question \\"How old was Prince Manuel when he died?\\" is 'no'.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Les Miles ends losing streak and keeps coach's job at LSU Les Miles rode across the Tiger Stadium field on the shoulders of his players while fans chanted his name. It would have been quite a send-off, except LSU’s administration doesn’t want him going anywhere after all. Minutes after LSU closed out the regular season with a 19-7 victory over Texas A&M, athletic director Joe Alleva said Miles will remain the Tigers’ coach. The announcement capped more than a week of speculation that Miles was on the verge of losing his job after his first three-game losing streak in his 11 years at LSU. “I’m looking forward to working with Coach Miles as he leads this team to a bowl game and another great recruiting class,” Alleva said as Miles’ wife, Kathy, and their four children looked on. “Les and I have talked. We have talked about this program and we are committed together to working to win and compete at the highest level.” LSU’s administration had allowed speculation about Miles’ status to fester by refusing to comment on the matter last week, but Alleva stressed that he was only following his policy of waiting until after the season to comment on a coach’s future. Indeed, Miles said he did not know for sure whether he’d just coached his last game on the home sideline of Death Valley until after the game. He said LSU president F King Alexander informed him first, followed by Alleva. “We’re a talented football team. We seemed to undershoot our mark this year,” Miles said. “I agree with Joe. Winning championships is something Joe wants to work toward fully and I’m right with him. It’s not enough to win occasionally. You have to win all the time. I get that.” LSU players didn’t find out until word began circulating about Alleva’s announcement. Tigers senior right tackle Vadal Alexander said he found out when he got a text from his parents and just smiled. Victory over Texas A&M (8-4, 4-4) did not come easily for the Tigers (8-3, 5-3), who trailed until Derrius Guice’s 50-yard scoring run in the third quarter. Leonard Fournette ran for 159 yards and a touchdown. He finished the game owning LSU’s single-season rushing record at 1,741 yards, surpassing the mark of 1,686 yards set by Charles Alexander in 1977. “It has been hard, not just with [speculation about] coach Miles, but with us having lost the last three games,” Fournette said. “These last three weeks will help this team grow and help us grow in life. I can say this has been one of the longest three weeks in my life. It was hard for everybody.” Kyle Allen passed for 161 yards and one touchdown for the Aggies, but had a pass intercepted by Donte Jackson inside the final two minutes, all but sealing LSU’s victory. Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin said his team’s turnovers and problems protecting Allen tipped the game in LSU’s favor. “It is kind of hard when the quarterback can’t set his feet and move the ball down field,” Sumlin said. “LSU played very well on defense.” As the game ended, fans chanted, “Keep Les Miles! Keep Les Miles!” They got their wish. Throughout game day, Miles’ biggest fans made sure they were seen and heard. During the “Tiger Walk,” from the team buses to the stadium, Miles was greeted like a hero as he waved to the crowd, at times pausing and turning around as if to soak it all in. Many fans held up signs expressing support for the embattled coach, some urging LSU to give him at least one more season. Inside Death Valley before kickoff, the crowd roared when Miles was introduce during Senior Day ceremonies. The coach tipped his trademark baseball cap to acknowledge the crowd, raising the volume a little more. Miles overall record improved to 111-32. LSU could have had a nine-win regular season if not for lightning canceling the season opener against heavy underdog McNeese State. Yet, some of the very aspects of LSU’s game that have bothered Miles’ critics showed up again. There were a handful of pre-snap penalties and the passing game was largely ineffective. Brandon Harris was seven of 21 for 83 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. A number of his passes sailed over intended receivers or skipped off the grass short of their mark. Most of his receptions came on check downs to running backs, including a critical third-down swing pass to Fournette for a 17-yard gain that sustained the Tigers’ final scoring drive. It didn’t help that kicker Trent Domingue, who’d missed only one field goal all season coming in, missed three against the Aggies. When the Tigers finally produced a big play to take a 13-7 lead, it came on Guice’s long run. The Aggies, who led 7-6 at halftime, scored their lone TD on Allen’s eight-yard, third-down pass over the middle to Ricky Seals-Jones. The Aggies squandered a chance to widen their lead when Allen was sacked and stripped by Kendell Beckwith on the LSU 13, with the Tigers’ Devon Godchaux recovering. Summary:","completion":"A football coach named Les Miles was almost going to lose his job because his team, LSU, had lost three games in a row. However, after they won a game against Texas A&M, the athletic director, Joe Alleva, decided that Les Miles could keep being the team's coach. There was a lot of talk about whether he would stay or not, but in the end, everyone was happy that he was staying to help the team win more games and find more great players.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album? ? Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

Based on the premise \\"but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"It's heavily guarded outside my place.\\" is true?","completion":"To conclude whether the hypothesis \\"It's heavily guarded outside my place\\" is true based on the premise \\"but I have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me,\\" let's analyze the given information in a step-by-step manner: Step 1: Identify the key elements in the premise In the premise, we have the following key elements: - A \\"big army\\" is mentioned, which indicates a large number of military personnel or protective forces. - The \\"big army\\" is \\"outside of my place,\\" suggesting that they are stationed around the speaker's residence. - The phrase \\"nobody can touch me\\" suggests that the presence of the \\"big army\\" provides powerful security or protection. Step 2: Compare the key elements to the hypothesis The hypothesis \\"It's heavily guarded outside my place\\" focuses on the presence of a strong defense or protection presence in the same location – outside the speaker's residence. Step 3: Examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis Based on the key elements from the premise, we can deduce that having a \\"big army\\" implies a strong security presence. This large-scale security presence would likely be considered \\"heavy guarding.\\" Step 4: Conclude if the hypothesis is true based on the premise Based on the analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"It's heavily guarded outside my place\\" is true, since the presence of a \\"big army\\" in the same location implies a strong security presence or heavy guarding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Key information: Nations with more industry produce more hazardous waste. Step 2: Analyze the information given in the question. A small nation increased its production capabilities by building several large factories, which implies an increase in industry. Step 3: Apply the key information from the paragraph to the question. Since the small nation has increased its industry, we can conclude that it would produce more hazardous waste. Step 4: Determine the impact on the river next to the factories.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Physiological Processes of Echinoderms Echinoderms have a unique system for gas exchange, nutrient circulation, and locomotion called the water vascular system. The system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals extending along each arm. Water circulates through these structures allowing for gas, nutrient, and waste exchange. A structure on top of the body, called the madreporite, regulates the amount of water in the water vascular system. “Tube feet,” which protrude through openings in the endoskeleton, may be expanded or contracted using the hydrostatic pressure in the system. The system allows for slow movement, but a great deal of power, as witnessed when the tube feet latch on to opposite halves of a bivalve mollusk, like a clam, and slowly, but surely pull the shells apart, exposing the flesh within.

But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther. \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago. Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed. Uncertainties about the health and life span of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis. Wilmut and others _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\" The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted with more than 1,000 cloned embryos. In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea.

The original sentence only provides information about the woman's appearance, the fact that she is holding sunglasses, and that she has food in her possession. There is no mention of what type of food she is holding or where it has been sourced from. To better understand this, let's break down the details of both sentences: 1. \\"An unhappy looking woman is holding a pair of sunglasses and food.\\" - We gather that the woman appears unhappy. - The woman is holding two items: sunglasses and food. - There is no specific description or identification of the type of food mentioned. 2. \\"The woman just ordered a Big Mac.\\" - This statement suggests that the woman recently placed an order for a Big Mac. - A Big Mac is a type of fast food burger from McDonald's. - Placing an order for something implies that it is either in the process of being prepared or has been prepared and is awaiting collection or delivery.

Information: - Mexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by the big three painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement. - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein; 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army. - Lázaro Cárdenas del Río (May 21, 1895 October 19, 1970) was a general in the Mexican Revolution and a statesman who served as President of Mexico between 1934 and 1940. He is best known for nationalization of the oil industry in 1938 and the creation of Pemex, the government oil company. - The Mexican Communist Party (PCM) was a communist party in Mexico. It was founded in 1911 as the Socialist Workers' Party (PSO) by Manabendra Nath Roy, a left-wing Indian Bengali intellectual. The PSO changed its name to the Mexican Communist Party in November 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. It was outlawed in 1925 and remained illegal until 1935, during the presidency of the leftist Lázaro Cárdenas. The PCM later lost its registration in 1946 because it did not meet the new requirements of at least 30,000 registered members in at least 21 of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District. It is not clear whether the party was unable to recruit enough members or whether, fearing repression, it refused to turn membership rolls over to the Secretary of the Interior, then in charge of elections. - David Alfaro Siqueiros ( born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros , December 29 , 1896 , in Chihuahua - January 6 , 1974 , in Cuernavaca , Morelos ) was a Mexican social realist painter , better known for his large murals in fresco . Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco , he established \`\` Mexican Muralism . '' He was a Marxist - Leninist in support of Stalin and a member of the Mexican Communist Party who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940 . His surname would normally be Alfaro by Spanish naming customs ; like Picasso ( Pablo Ruiz y Picasso ) and Lorca ( Federico García Lorca ) , Siqueiros used his mother 's surname . It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state , but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua , but grew up in Irapuato , Guanajuato , at least from the age of six . The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol , who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros . Siqueiros changed his given name to \`\` David '' after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo 's David . Another factual confusion is the year of his birth : he was born in 1896 , but many sources state 1898 or 1899 . - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.

He continued singing gospel in church, performing solos as a child while his mother sang in the local choir. While at Huffman High School, he played football for which he received a scholarship to Alabama A&M University. Studdard's third album, The Return was released in October 2006; it goes back to his R&B roots, but is different from his previous efforts. Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single \\"Change Me\\" was released ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with \\"Change Me\\" (which reached number one) and its successor \\"Make Ya Feel Beautiful\\". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: \\"Coming out to my show is like coming to my house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening.\\" Studdard appeared on the finale of American Idol season 6 in May 2007.

Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Thorgal is a Belgian fantasy comic book series by the Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and the Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiski. It combines several themes and legends, ranging from Norse mythology and Atlantean fantasy to science fiction, and such genres as dark drama, horror and adventure stories. - European comics are comics produced in Europe. The \\"comic album\\" is a very common printed medium. The typical \\"album\\" is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, roughly A4-sized, approx. 21x30 centimetres (8.4x11.6 in), has around 4060 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and \\"Asterix\\", to more adult subjects like \\"Tex Willer\\" and \\"Thorgal\\". - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - Tex Willer is the main fictional character of the Italian comics series \\"Tex\\", created by writer Gian Luigi Bonelli and illustrator Aurelio Galleppini, and first published in Italy on 30 September 1948. It is among the most popular characters of Italian comics, with translations to numerous languages all around the world. The fan base in Brazil is especially large, but it is very popular also in Finland, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, France, Tamil Nadu, Serbia and Spain. The \\"Tex Willer\\" series is an Italian-made interpretation of the American Old West, inspired by the classical characters and stories of old American Western movies. - Wallonia (, , Dutch: \\"Wallonië\\" ) is a region of Belgium. Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are created for a Belgian and French audience. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as \\"BD\\"s, an abbreviation of \\"bandes dessinées\\" (literally \\"drawn strips\\") in French and \\"stripverhalen\\" (literally \\"strip stories\\") or simply \\"strips\\" in Dutch. Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style, both in art as well as in spirit. - Edgard Félix Pierre Jacobs ( 30 March 1904 -- 20 February 1987 ) , better known under his pen name Edgar P. Jacobs , was a Belgian comic book creator ( writer and artist ) , born in Brussels , Belgium . He was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement , through his collaborations with Hergé and the graphic novel series that made him famous , Blake and Mortimer . - Georges Prosper Remi (22 May 1907 3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé, was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\", the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, \\"Quick & Flupke\\" (193040) and \\"The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko\\" (193657). His works were executed in his distinct \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style. - Belgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \\"an integral part of Belgian culture\\". - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging. - Asterix or The Adventures of Asterix (or \\"Astérix le Gaulois\\") is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Pilote\\" on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium. - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - Blake and Mortimer is a Belgian comics series created by the Belgian writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It was one of the first series to appear in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Tintin\\" in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Les Editions du Lombard. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014. It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as \\"good fin de siècle ensemble\\".

Article: IMAGINE if, to collect your salary each month, you had to walk to the nearest town, perhaps tens of miles away, to gather in a school or a football court or a church. There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of forming a rock in the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, you need to understand the basic rules and principles of the game, along with the technique and appropriate hand gesture for representing a rock. Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet popular game played worldwide and is often used as a decision-making tool or a fun pastime between friends. The game is played by two people who simultaneously choose one of the three available options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules: - Rock beats Scissors - Scissors beat Paper - Paper beats Rock To form a rock, follow these steps: 1. Position yourself in front of your opponent: Stand or sit facing your opponent so that both of you can clearly see each other's hand gestures. 2. Prepare for the countdown: The game usually begins with a verbal countdown, generally in the form of saying \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" out loud or counting to three. 3. Create a fist: As the countdown begins, clench your hand into a fist. Ensure that your fingers are curled towards the palm with your thumb resting across your first or second fingers. This gesture represents a rock. 4. Synchronize the gesture with the countdown: As you and your opponent say \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" or count to three, both of you should simultaneously make your hand gestures for rock, paper, or scissors at the same time. This is typically done by swinging your hand downward and then displaying your chosen gesture when the countdown reaches its end. 5. Determine the winner: After both you and your opponent have made your gestures, compare them to see which hand gesture prevails according to the game's rules. In this case, if your opponent has formed a scissors gesture, your rock gesture wins. If they formed a paper gesture, you lose. If both of you formed rock gestures, the round results in a tie, and you can play again. Remember that the key to a successful rock gesture in Rock, Paper, Scissors is to maintain a properly clenched fist and synchronize the gesture with the countdown to ensure fair play. As you become comfortable forming the rock gesture, you can further develop your game strategy by observing your opponent's patterns and tendencies in order to predict and counter their moves. This will enhance your chances of winning and allow you to enjoy the game even more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This indicates that Jordan was helpful and did something positive for Jan. Step 2: Analyze each emotion and its relation to the situation a) resentful toward Jordan: Resentment arises when someone feels they have been unfairly treated or when they harbor negative feelings towards someone. In this case, Jordan's action was helpful to Jan, so feeling resentful would not align with the situation. b) grateful to Jordan: Gratitude is the feeling of appreciation and thankfulness for someone's actions. Since Jordan found and returned Jan's wallet, Jan has a good reason to feel grateful towards Jordan. c) angry at Jordan: Anger typically arises from feelings of being wronged or upset about a situation. In this context, Jordan's actions were helpful, so it would not make sense for Jan to feel angry at Jordan.

Please answer the following question: Here's a logic test: Mars has much weaker gravity than Jupiter because it (A) has more mass (B) has less mass Choose the answer between \\"Mars\\" and \\"Jupiter\\". Answer:","completion":"Jupiter To address the logic test provided in the question, it is crucial to understand the factors that contribute to the strength of a planet's gravitational pull. Primarily, the force of gravity is determined by two factors: the mass of the celestial body (planet) and the distance between the center of the body and the object experiencing the force. In this context, consider the planets Mars and Jupiter. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system and comparatively smaller in size. It has a mass of approximately 6.42 x 10^23 kg, which is only about 0.107 times that of Earth. The weaker gravity on Mars, roughly 62.5% less than that of Earth, can be attributed directly to its lesser mass. Jupiter, on the other hand, is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. Its mass is around 1.898 x 10^27 kg, making it about 317.8 times the mass of Earth. As a result of this enormous mass, Jupiter has a much stronger gravitational pull than Mars. Comparing the two options given in the question (A) Mars has more mass and (B) Mars has less mass, option (B) is the correct answer since Mars has less mass than Jupiter. Therefore, the strength of the gravitational pull on Mars is much weaker compared to that of Jupiter.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Do you know how long you are willing to be long distance? Does your partner know? It is important to agree on a length of time. If the distance depends on a circumstance with no certain end date, your reunion may keep getting pushed off. Make sure that you discuss the financial aspects of maintaining your relationship with your partner as well. Being in a long distance relationship can be expensive, especially if you travel often to see your partner. If your partner is waiting for a controlling parent to \\"back off,\\" that means neither of you have any control over the date. Similarly, if you are waiting for a job to open up in your partner's city, you may be stuck waiting with no date in sight. To avoid this, agree on a date by which you will either move (with or without the job) or break up. For instance, you might say \\"I'll move to your city as soon as I find a job there. However, if I haven't found one in the next six months, I'll just move and take my chances.\\" However, make sure that you have a conversation about finances before doing something like this to make sure that one partner is able to support the other as they look for a job. If you are planning to be in a perpetually distant relationship, make sure you are both okay with that. You should both feel comfortable with the amount of texting, calling, emailing, and visiting you do. Ask your partner if they feel you're at the right level, and ask yourself how you feel as well. If you find that one of you is feeling neglected or inundated, agree on a different schedule together. If it feels like only one of you is willing to compromise, your relationship might not be working. You should still be able to hang out with friends, visit family, go to parties, and have time to yourself. If you feel like your long distance relationship is making it impossible for you to have a social life where you are, you need to draw some boundaries. Tell your partner you can't visit them as frequently. Explain that you are feeling lonely from never making any friends where you are. Explain to your partner that you will schedule a certain amount of time to talk to them, but that you can't be on call constantly. If your partner freaks out or refuses, your relationship might not be working. Do you know the terms of your relationship? Does your partner? Ask yourself what you expect, then make this clear to your partner and ask what they expect as well. For instance, if you believe that you and your partner are monogamous, in love, and heading toward living together in the next few years, tell your partner! Similarly, if you believe you and your partner are in an open relationship, you'll need to define those terms as well. Being distant means communicating more, not less, so make an effort to get on the same page. If your partner wants to \\"keep it loose,\\" that means they aren't willing to be open with you about their expectations. That's a bad sign. Summary:","completion":"In a long-distance relationship, it is crucial for both partners to communicate openly and establish clear expectations. This includes agreeing on the duration of the long-distance phase, understanding the financial implications, and ensuring that both partners' social and emotional needs are met. Effective communication also entails discussing the terms of the relationship, such as commitments to monogamy or openness. To maintain a healthy long-distance relationship, both individuals need to be on the same page and willing to compromise and adjust to each other's needs. If one partner exhibits a reluctance to openly discuss expectations or make necessary adjustments, it may be a sign that the relationship is not functioning well."},{"prompt":"Possible answers: a.

In this step, I evaluate the credibility of Mohammed Ali's account by checking if there are any witnesses or any form of documentation, such as images or videos, that can verify his claim. Credibility is crucial to prevent any spread of false information and uphold the journalistic standards. Step 5: Analyze the situation and summarize findings. Using all the gathered information, I will write an analysis of the situation, detailing how the incident occurred, Mohammed Ali's reaction and his complaint to Tesco, and the council's current investigation. I will also add the statements from the parties involved and collate information on deep-frying safety guidelines. Conclusion: After a thorough investigation, the article will capture the shocking experience of Mohammed Ali and will serve as a reminder of the importance of food preparation and deep-frying safety. The article will shed light on the events that transpired and the steps taken in response by Tesco and the local council."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"The text refers to a film, \\"The Far Call.\\""},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Weather has a strong effect on people. It influences health, intelligence and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\\"perfect weather\\"for work and health.

Former Labour Foreign Secretary and party donor David Owen has been exposed as having invested in a tax avoidance scheme – in a major embarrassment for Ed Miliband. Lord Owen has been ordered to repay around £50,000 after an investigation by the tax authorities. He is a supporter of Mr Miliband and last year he gave £7,500 to the Labour party. HMRC investigators will this month insist the 76-year-old settles within 90 days or face legal action. Lord Owen has been ordered to repay £50,000 following an investigation by HMRC in an embarrassing development for the Labour party. Leader Ed Miliband has in the past taunted the Tories over having 'dodgy donors' His tax avoidance arrangement appears to have undermined Mr Miliband’s ‘dodgy donors’ taunt hurled at the Conservatives in the wake of the HSBC tax scandal. Lord Owen served in the Callaghan government as Foreign Secretary between 1977 and 1979. He left Labour in 1981 – one of the Gang of Four who formed the SDP. He now sits in the Lords as an independent Social Democrat. In 2010, he ploughed almost £70,000 into a business partnership called the Cumberland House BPRA Property Fund. Investment advisers Downing claimed it offered ‘attractive taxation incentives’ under the Business Premises Renovation Allowance. One expert estimated that Lord Owen’s original sum would have ‘grossed up’ to around £130,000 – leaving him with an avoidance bill of ‘between £50k and £60k’. Lord Owen said: ‘My accountants are instructed to be completely open with HMRC and to pay what is due.’ Last night, the Labour party did not respond to our requests for a comment.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Puskas? Possible answers: (1). He hates army life (2). not enough information (3). He's a good father (4). He likes soccer","completion":"(3). He's a good father"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

Article: On March 17 there will be an explosion of green colour across the world in celebration of St Patrick's Day. The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness. Question: Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from? Options: A: From their everyday behavior towards other people. B: From the behavior of Irish immigrants to the America in the 19thcentury. C: From the historical records of the 19thcentury Ireland.

Meristems are specialized tissues present in plants responsible for growth and regeneration. There are two types of meristems: primary and secondary. Primary meristems enable roots to grow in length (apical meristem), while secondary meristems, such as the vascular cambium and cork cambium, allow for growth in width (lateral meristems).

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip. Question: Which of the following should parents do to help their kids learn good table manners?

I have just managed to obtain my tier 2 UK work Visa. What would be the requirement for my partner (unmarried) to apply as a dependant? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The questions you have asked are not exactly the same but are related because they both concern the tier 2 general dependent visa process. The first question targets the need for an English language certificate, while the second question asks for requirements for an unmarried partner to apply as a dependent. I will address both questions separately below. 1. English Language Certificate for Tier 2 General Dependent Visa: For a tier 2 general dependent visa applicant, providing an English language certificate is usually not required. The primary English language proficiency requirements apply to the main tier 2 visa applicant, who must prove their knowledge of the English language by passing a secure English language test (SELT) or showing they have a degree taught in English. However, if the dependent were to eventually apply for settlement or indefinite leave to remain in the UK, they may need to show evidence of their English language proficiency by meeting the requirements of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) at the A1 level for applications made on or after 1st October 2013 and the A2 level for applications made on or after 1st May 2017. 2. Requirements for an Unmarried Partner to Apply as a Dependent: To apply for the Tier 2 General Dependent Visa as an unmarried partner, you and your partner must meet the following requirements: a) Genuine relationship: You must show evidence that you are in a genuine and subsisting relationship with the main Tier 2 visa holder, comparable to a marriage or civil partnership. This usually entails showing proof that you have been living together in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least two years. b) Maintenance funds: You will need to demonstrate that you have adequate funds to maintain yourselves (and any dependents) without needing public funds. The main Tier 2 visa holder must have a minimum income of £18,600 per year, with another £3,800 for the first dependent and £2,400 for each additional dependent. c) No recourse to public funds: As a dependent on the Tier 2 visa, you are not allowed to access public funds in the UK, and you must provide a declaration to confirm that you will not do so. d) Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS): All applicants, including dependents, are required to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge to cover healthcare provided by the National Health Service (NHS) during their stay in the UK. e) Valid application: The application must be submitted online and should contain the necessary supporting documents. Dependent applications can either be submitted at the same time as the principal Tier 2 applicant or at a later date. f) Visa application fee: There is a fee for the tier 2 general dependent visa application, which needs to be paid when submitting the application. Please note that unmarried partners must show sufficient evidence of the genuineness of their relationship when applying as a dependent. This may include joint financial accounts, shared rental or ownership of properties, shared responsibilities and commitments (e.g., children), and other documents that demonstrate the long-term nature of the relationship. In conclusion, while the English language certificate is not required when applying for the Tier 2 General Dependent visa, other requirements must be met, including proving the genuine and subsisting nature of the relationship. The questions you asked are related but focus on different aspects of the tier 2 general dependent visa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Given the background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. and the situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Answer the following question: Which lever would produce greater increase in force, lever A or lever B? A:","completion":"Lever A would produce a greater increase in force compared to lever B. This is because Lever A is designed with an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning it does not have to overcome any friction, whereas Lever B, as a real-world lever, has to deal with friction which decreases its actual mechanical advantage. In actual scenarios, no machine can achieve the ideal mechanical advantage due to the presence of friction; thus, Lever A, as a hypothetical lever with ideal mechanical advantage, will have a greater force increase as compared to Lever B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt. Scientists are still studying all the ways icebergs affect sea life. Options: A Fresh water. B Salty ocean water. C Tiny bubbles of air. D The snow. Answer: C Tiny bubbles of air.

Please answer a question about the following article about Empiricism: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction. What did Mill misrepresent about math?","completion":"Mill said that math is just like other types of knowledge that we learn through our experiences and making guesses based on those experiences. This is called inductive inference. But, Mill didn't really understand how math works. Math uses a special way of thinking called deductive reasoning, which is different from inductive inference. In math, we start with some basic rules, and then we use those rules to figure out new things step by step in a very organized way. This method does not rely on our experiences or guesses.

He's been in the criminal world for the past 20 years, pulling off some of the most audacious heists that no one else dared to handle. But now, he seeks to settle down, longing for peace and a quiet family life with his estranged daughter, Emily, who detests his criminal lifestyle. Johnny plans the theft of a lifetime - the Jewel of Destiny - an infamous diamond worth 200 million kept in Geneva's most highly secure and impenetrable vault, the Fortress of Solitaire. However, the owner of the diamond is no other than ruthless billionaire and criminal kingpin, Victor Maldonado, who was once betrayed by Johnny in a failed heist and now seeks deadly revenge. Simultaneously, an FBI agent, Richard Williams, is close on Johnny’s tail, making the heist even riskier. Despite the odds, Johnny and his old team, including expert hacker Lisa, the agile and resourceful Tim, and the master of disguises, Paul, decide to come together for this grand finale. Meanwhile, Johnny tries to mend the relationship with his daughter, who's on her way to becoming a proficient lawyer. Emily initially resists, but soon she stumbles upon the warm-hearted side of Johnny, seeing him not just as a thief, but also as the loving father he tries to be. As the heist day draws closer, the stakes ramp up. Unexpected betrayal, Victor's relentless revenge, Richard’s unprecedented dedication, and Emily's discovery of Johnny's last heist plan - all combine to make it an unforgettable climax. In an unexpected twist, Johnny pulls off the massive heist, not for wealth, but to expose Victor's numerous criminal activities subtly linked with the Jewel of Destiny. Johnny becomes a hero to the public eye and confidential informer to the law enforcement, helping them bring Victor to justice, finally retiring as a thief, morphing into a law aiding citizen. In the end, not only does he reconcile with his daughter, but he also helps her build her own case against Victor with evidence collected through all his years of theft. This last heist seals Johnny's legacy as the most celebrated thief to have lived while dramatically uniting him with his family and a peaceful life he always desired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If there is more rain after a forest fire, it can have both positive and negative effects on the unprotected animals in the environment. The supposed perturbation can influence the second effect mentioned, which is losing their homes. More Rain - Positive Effects: 1. Increased water supply: More rain would help replenish water sources, making it easier for the animals to find water for drinking and maintaining their daily needs. 2. Faster vegetation regrowth: Rain stimulates plant growth, helping the burned forest recover more quickly, providing shelter and food sources for animals sooner than if there were less rain. 3. Reduced risk of further wildfires: Rain can help saturate the soil, lessening the risk of another fire occurring shortly after the first one. More Rain - Negative Effects: 1. Flooding and erosion: Excess rainfall can cause floods and soil erosion, which can create hazards for the animals and exacerbate the already challenging living conditions. 2. Loss of temporary shelters: More rain might destroy the few remaining natural shelters or the makeshift shelters animals find after the fire; this would prolong their exposure to the elements. 3. Difficulty in finding food: If the rain is too heavy, it might wash away or spoil potential food sources that animals may rely on during this vulnerable period. Overall, more rain after a forest fire might lead to a mix of positive and negative effects. It could help by replenishing water sources and promoting vegetation regrowth, which would have a positive impact on the animals that lose their homes. However, it could also cause flooding, erosion, and difficulty in finding food, which might exacerbate the challenges faced by unprotected animals in the environment. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively determine whether more rain would have a more, less, or no effect on the second effect mentioned (losing their homes) without considering various factors like the intensity of the rain, the forest's initial conditions, and the specific species of animals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has four faces. Brahma is also known as \\"Svayambhu\\" (self-born), \\"Vga\\" (Lord of Speech), and the creator of the four Vedas, one from each of his mouths. Brahma is identified with the Vedic god Prajapati, as well as linked to Kama and Hiranyagarbha (the cosmic egg), he is more prominently mentioned in the post-Vedic Hindu epics and the mythologies in the Puranas. In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha. Brahma, along with Vishnu and Shiva, is part of a Hindu Trinity; however, ancient Hindu texts mention other trinities of gods or goddesses which do not include Brahma. - The Bhagavad Gita (\\"\\" in IAST, ; lit. \\"Song of the Lord\\"), often referred to as simply the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic \\"Mahabharata\\" (chapters 25 - 42 of the 6th book of Mahabharata). - The \\"Trimrti\\" (Sanskrit: \\"\\", \\"three forms\\") is the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer/transformer, though individual denominations may vary from that particular line-up. When all three deities of the Trimurti incarnate into a single avatar, the avatar is known as Dattatreya. - Narayana (Sanskrit: \\"Nryaa\\") or Narayanan is a Vedic deity associated with the waters of creation and sometimes with the sun.

Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE). - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia. - Shaivism or aivism (\\"aiva Patha\\", \\"Shiva's Path\\"), also known as Shivaism and Saivam, is one of the major branches of Sanathan Dharma (Hinduism), revering Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Followers of Shaivam are called \\"Shaivas\\", \\"Saivas\\", \\"Shaivites\\", or \\"Saivarkal\\". They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is.

The premise provided states that a young boy is in the water in two floating tubes. This information directly supports the hypothesis that there is a boy in the water. Let us analyze this further.

The boy is using two floating tubes. Hypothesis: boy in water The hypothesis simply states that there is a boy in the water. From the information provided by the premise, this hypothesis is supported. The premise states that a young boy is in the water while using two floating tubes. The fact that the boy is using floating tubes does not negate the fact that he is still in the water; rather, it gives additional context about the situation. So, if the premise is true and there indeed is a young boy in the water using two floating tubes, we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true as well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

Write an article based on this summary: Save your neopoints. Set goals. Collect interest. Hit the withdrawal limit. Get a Safety Deposit Box. Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Neopoint Management in Neopets: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: In the world of Neopets, the in-game currency known as Neopoints can be a powerful tool in helping you achieve your goals and elevate your gaming experience. Properly managing and saving your Neopoints can lead to a more enjoyable and streamlined experience in Neopia. In this article, we will cover key strategies and tips for optimizing your Neopoint management, including setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and utilizing a Safety Deposit Box. 1. Save Your Neopoints: The first step in effective Neopoint management is saving your accumulated currency. As you participate in games, quests, and various activities within Neopia, you will earn Neopoints. Building a strong reserve of Neopoints will enable you to engage in new opportunities and acquire valuable in-game assets. To save effectively, avoid impulsive purchases and carefully consider each expenditure to ensure it aligns with your Neopets goals. 2. Set Goals: Setting clear, achievable goals for your Neopets experience will provide direction and purpose for your Neopoint savings. Goals can include acquiring specific items, such as unique paintbrushes or rare Petpets, or reaching milestones like attaining a certain level for your Neopet. By establishing goals and understanding what is required to achieve them, you can better allocate your Neopoints and prioritize your in-game activities. 3. Collect Interest: One often overlooked aspect of Neopoint management is utilizing the National Neopian Bank to collect interest on your savings. By depositing your Neopoints into a bank account, you'll receive a daily interest payment calculated on your total balance. This passive income stream can add up over time and contribute significantly to your overall savings. Be sure to deposit your Neopoints into the bank regularly, and select a high-interest account that suits your savings goals. 4. Hit the Withdrawal Limit: While it's essential to save your Neopoints, there will come a time when you need to make withdrawals from your bank account to fund purchases or activities. However, careless withdrawals can undermine your savings efforts and hinder your progress towards your goals. To maintain a strategic approach to spending, set a daily withdrawal limit and make a conscious effort to stay within that boundary. This practice will help preserve your savings while still allowing you to participate in rewarding Neopets experiences. 5. Get a Safety Deposit Box: Lastly, acquiring a Safety Deposit Box for your Neopets account is a must for effective Neopoint management. A Safety Deposit Box enables you to securely store your valuable in-game items, ensuring they are protected from theft or loss. By having a centralized and safe location for your items, you can track your assets and maintain an accurate understanding of your overall Neopets wealth. Conclusion: In conclusion, mastering the art of Neopoint management in Neopets is crucial for optimizing your gaming experience. By saving your Neopoints, setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and utilizing a Safety Deposit Box, you can strategically invest in your in-game goals and maximize the enjoyment of your Neopia adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

(株式会社トラスト , Kabushikigaisha Torasuto ) is a Japanese automotive aftermarket company specialising in performance tuning parts for cars. The company is widely known for its subbrand of tuning parts GReddy and the turbochargers under this brand. Can we infer the following? The automotive aftermarket company GReddy is the owner of Trust Company Ltd., which produces tuning parts.","completion":"No, the inference is incorrect based on the information provided. GReddy is not the owner of Trust Company Ltd. Instead, it's the other way round. Trust Company Ltd., a Japanese automotive aftermarket company, owns the subbrand GReddy. Trust Company Ltd. is known for specializing in performance tuning parts for cars, and GReddy is a distinct brand under Trust Company Ltd. known specifically for its turbochargers. In corporate terms, Trust Company Ltd. is the parent company and GReddy is its subsidiary. This means that decision-making power concerning GReddy's operations lies primarily with Trust Company Ltd. The business relationship between Trust Company Ltd. and GReddy demonstrates a typical parent-subsidiary relationship wherein the parent company owns a majority stake in the subsidiary. To navigate this relationship, it's crucial to understand that Trust Company Ltd., the parent company, has full control over its sub-brand GReddy, which functions as a subsidiary. The parent company may set broad strategic goals for its subsidiary, but the subsidiary typically operates independently on a day-to-day basis. However, crucial business decisions about investment, expansion, or changes to business models often require the approval of the parent company. In summary, Trust Company Ltd. controls and owns the GReddy brand, which is widely known for its turbochargers. This indicates that the Japanese company has a diversified portfolio, aiming not only to offer general automotive aftermarket products but also to specialize in certain parts through its subbrands. Thus, Trust Company Ltd. doesn't just produce tuning parts; it strategically extends its operations and brand influence into more specialized segments of the automotive aftermarket industry through subbrands like GReddy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What famous train ran between Paris and Istanbul?","completion":"The famous train that ran between Paris and Istanbul is the Orient Express. The Orient Express was a long-distance luxury passenger train service created in 1883 by Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian entrepreneur and founder of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (International Sleeping-car Company). This illustrious train was a symbol of luxury travel, adventure, and intrigue during its operation, and its name continues to evoke romantic and exotic images of long-distance cross-continent travel. The original route of the Orient Express started in Paris, France, at the Gare de l'Est (East Train Station) and concluded in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Sirkeci Station, covering a distance of approximately 1,700 miles (2,735 kilometers). The train traversed through numerous European countries, including France, Germany, Austria-Hungary (modern-day Austria and Hungary), Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The Orient Express was composed of luxurious sleeping cars, restaurant cars, and lounge cars, designed to provide the utmost comfort and elegance for its passengers. The train became synonymous with high-end travel, catering to the rich, famous, and royalty. The opulent train boasted extravagant interiors decorated with engraved glass, polished wood, fine fabrics, and brass fittings, offering a lavish setting for international travelers of the era. Over the years, the route changed several times, and multiple variations of the Orient Express were introduced. One such variation was the Simplon Orient Express, which was initiated in 1919, passing through Switzerland via the Simplon Tunnel, traversing Italy, and eventually reaching Istanbul. The train gained further notoriety after being linked to several literary works, particularly Agatha Christie's iconic 1934 novel, \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" and the James Bond novel \\"From Russia with Love\\" by Ian Fleming, both of which were later adapted into successful films. Additionally, the Orient Express, with its diverse and sophisticated passengers, played an essential role in the exchange of cultures, ideas, and diplomacy between Western and Eastern Europe during its years of operation. The original Orient Express ceased operations in May 1977, mainly due to increased competition from faster means of transportation, such as air travel, and the decline in interest for luxury rail travel. However, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express was revived in 1982 by James B. Sherwood, an American entrepreneur, with restored vintage carriages offering luxurious rail travel experiences from London to Venice and other European destinations. Although this modern iteration doesn't exactly replicate the original Orient Express route, it still manages to capture the glamour, opulence, and essence of the legendary train's golden era. In summary, the Orient Express was a distinguished long-distance luxury passenger train that ran between Paris and Istanbul, earning its fame through multiple literary works and attracting elite and renowned passengers from various parts of the world. The train's legacy remains a symbol of timeless luxury and romance, evoking a bygone era of elegant overland travel."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Over priced bad food","completion":"Upon analyzing the given review, it can be determined that it is a negative review. There are two main reasons for this conclusion: 1. The phrase \\"over priced\\" implies that the reviewer believes the food they received was not worth the amount they paid for it. This dissatisfaction may result from a comparison with similar food items from other establishments that are lower in price, better in quality, or both. Additionally, the term \\"overpriced\\" suggests that the reviewer feels they didn't receive an adequate value for their money and may feel cheated or disappointed. 2. The statement \\"bad food\\" is a direct and clear expression of the reviewer's negative opinion of the food quality. This suggests that the food may have had issues such as undesirable taste, lack of freshness, improper cooking, or presentation problems. The reviewer's dissatisfaction with the food could also be due to factors like unmet expectations, inconsistency with the menu's description, or not meeting their personal preferences. When a reviewer uses the term \\"bad\\" for describing the food, it indicates they didn't enjoy the experience and could even be warning others about it. In conclusion, this review is negative as it demonstrates the reviewer's disappointment with both the price and the quality of the food. Their dissatisfaction with the dining experience may influence potential customers to avoid this establishment in favor of other options with better perceived value and food quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: where do I find the Fornax consyellaiton","completion":"In order to determine the best solution for finding the Fornax constellation, let us analyze two possible solutions: using star charts and maps or utilizing technology such as mobile apps or a computer program. Solution 1: Using star charts and maps Star charts and maps have been used for centuries to track celestial bodies in the night sky. To find the Fornax constellation using this method, follow these steps: 1. Determine your location and, if possible, the exact latitude and longitude. This will aid in accurately pinpointing the Fornax constellation based on your locality. 2. Acquire a star chart or map specific to your location. There are various types of star maps available, including planispheres, which can be adjusted according to the date and time to display the night sky accurately. 3. Identify the Fornax constellation on the star chart. Typically, it is located in the southern hemisphere, between the constellations of Cetus and Eridanus. If you are unsure about the constellation's appearance, conduct some background research or consult an astronomy guidebook to learn more. 4. Locate Fornax in the night sky. When referencing the star chart, ensure that the map's orientation corresponds with your view of the sky. The Fornax constellation can be seen more easily during the months of November and December when it is at its highest point in the sky, just before midnight. 5. Once Fornax is visible, use nearby stars or constellations as guides to find its exact location. Neighboring constellations such as Cetus, Sculptor, and Phoenix can help you in this process. Solution 2: Using technology (mobile apps or computer programs) In recent years, technology has played a significant role in simplifying the process of stargazing and locating celestial bodies. 1. Select a reliable astronomy app or computer program. Notable options include Stellarium, SkySafari, Star Walk, and Google Sky Map. 2. Configure the app or program according to your exact location, time, and date. 3. Search for the Fornax constellation within the app or program. Most applications will provide general information about the constellation, its location in the sky, and its associated stars. 4. Utilize the app or program's augmented reality (AR) feature, if available. This allows you to point your device towards the sky as the app overlays the constellations on your view. 5. Adjust the settings to pinpoint the location of Fornax in the night sky. The app or program will direct you towards the constellation by providing real-time guidance and visual cues. Conclusion Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages. The traditional method of using star charts and maps promotes a deeper understanding of the night sky and fosters a sense of achievement when finally locating the constellation. However, it may require more effort, time, and knowledge compared to the technological approach. The use of mobile apps or computer programs offers a more accessible and user-friendly experience that can cater to beginners and experienced stargazers alike. The various tools, features, and real-time guidance make locating the Fornax constellation more efficient, effortless, and engaging. Ultimately, the better solution will depend on personal preferences and needs. For those who prefer a hands-on and traditional approach, using star charts and maps is a suitable option. On the other hand, those who require a more convenient and interactive experience may find that utilizing technology offers the ideal solution for finding the Fornax constellation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Input: - Premise: The jewelry thieves were caught. - Alternative 1: The stolen jewelry was returned to its owners. - Alternative 2: The cost of the stolen jewelry was calculated. To solve this task, we need to analyze the given premise and two alternatives and determine which alternative is more likely to happen as a result or cause of the thieves being caught. In this case, we have: Premise: The jewelry thieves were caught. This means that the thieves were apprehended by the authorities, and it's likely that the stolen jewelry would be recovered. Now, let's analyze the alternatives: 1. The stolen jewelry was returned to its owners. This alternative suggests that once the thieves were caught, the authorities managed to return the stolen goods to their rightful owners. This is a likely consequence of the thieves being caught. 2. The cost of the stolen jewelry was calculated. This alternative suggests that the value of the stolen jewelry was determined. While this may happen during an investigation, it is not a direct cause or effect of the thieves being caught.

Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker's life was riddled with depression and heroin addiction. This addiction caused him to miss performances and be considered unemployable. He frequently resorted to busking, receiving loans from fellow musicians and admirers, and pawning his saxophones for drug money. Heroin use was rampant in the jazz scene, and users could acquire it with little difficulty. Although he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \\"Max Making Wax\\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \\"Lover Man\\", producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On \\"Bebop\\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \\"Blow!\\" at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of \\"Lover Man\\" to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve. Parker's life took a turn for the worst when his 2 year old daughter tragically passed away from pneumonia. He attempted suicide twice in 1954, which landed him in a mental hospital. When Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \\"classic quintet\\" including Davis and Roach.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who were contacted in a similar manner by one of the songwriters posing as an employee of James Horner? Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \\"irrefutable evidence\\" that \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \\"three-note motif\\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \\"This Game We Play\\" was submitted to MGM.

Objective: What adhesive metal should you use when soldering glass? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"When soldering glass, you cannot use an adhesive metal directly. Instead, you typically use a combination of materials to bond the glass pieces together. To achieve this connection, you can use copper foil and solder. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. In terms of naive physics reasoning, you need to choose a metal that adheres to glass and can withstand heat from the soldering process. Copper is a good choice, as it has a relatively low melting point and adheres well to glass surfaces. In stained glass soldering, copper foil is commonly used. 2. Apply the copper foil to the edges of the pieces of glass you want to join. The copper foil needs to be wrapped around the edges of the glass pieces evenly and smoothly, leaving no gaps. Press it firmly onto the glass to ensure a strong bond. 3. Apply flux to the copper foil on the glass pieces. Flux is essential for the soldering process, as it improves the flow of solder and helps it adhere to the copper foil and glass. Brush a thin layer of flux along the copper foil where the glass pieces will connect. 4. Using a soldering iron, heat up the solder, which is usually made up of tin and lead or a lead-free alternative. The solder will melt and flow into a liquid state. 5. Carefully apply the molten solder to the flux-covered copper foil on the glass pieces. The solder will bond with the copper foil, creating a strong adhesive joint between the glass pieces. 6. Allow the solder to cool down and solidify. This will create a secure and long-lasting connection between the glass pieces. In summary, the more sound naive physics reasoning solution in this case would be to use a combination of materials, specifically copper foil and solder, to bond the glass pieces together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer appears to have had an overwhelmingly unfavorable impression of the television program being discussed, as indicated by their passionate and forceful language. The statement \\"Dear God, please strike me blind!\\" implies that the reviewer would prefer losing their ability to see, rather than be subjected to watching the show in question. This hyperbolic expression demonstrates a strong sense of distaste for the content being reviewed.

What is the best way to: how to change a lightbulb","completion":"Changing a lightbulb may seem like a simple task, but it's essential to follow the correct steps and take safety precautions to ensure a seamless and safe process. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide on the best way to change a lightbulb. 1. Safety first: Before attempting to change the lightbulb, ensure your own safety. Switch off the light and unplug it if possible, or turn off the power supply for the room at the main circuit breaker or fuse box. 2. Gather necessary materials: You will need a new lightbulb compatible with the fixture (pay attention to wattage, size, and type), a stepladder or chair (if necessary), a non-conductive tool, such as a pair of rubber gloves, and a dry cloth or tissue for handling the lightbulb. 3. Prepare the area: Position the stepladder or chair under the fixture so you have easy access to the lightbulb. Ensure the surface is stable and even before climbing it. 4. Remove the old lightbulb: Put on your rubber gloves and make sure your hands are dry. Carefully climb the ladder or chair and gently grip the lightbulb, making sure to hold it steady with one hand while the other rests on a sturdy surface. Turn the lightbulb counterclockwise to unscrew it. If it's a tricky or old lightbulb, it may require a little force to loosen it. If the bulb is still warm, let it cool down before attempting to remove it. 5. Inspect the socket: Before inserting the new lightbulb, examine the socket for damage and residue. Clean the socket with a dry cloth if necessary to remove any dust or debris. If you notice any damage, you may need to consult with an electrician to replace the socket. 6. Install the new lightbulb: Hold the new lightbulb with a dry cloth or tissue to prevent leaving any oily residue from your fingers, which might affect the lightbulb's performance. Align the threads of the lightbulb with the socket, and screw the bulb in a clockwise direction. Be careful not to overtighten or force the lightbulb, as this might damage the components or cause it to break. 7. Test the new lightbulb: Once the lightbulb is secure, carefully descend the ladder or chair. Plug the light or turn the power back on at the circuit breaker or fuse box. Test the new lightbulb by turning on the light. If it doesn't light up, double-check the bulb is correctly installed and the power supply is operational. If issues persist, consult an electrician or seek professional advice. 8. Dispose of the old lightbulb: Finally, dispose of the old lightbulb properly. Some lightbulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs, require special disposal procedures due to their mercury content. Check your local recycling center or municipality guidelines for proper disposal options. By following these steps and taking necessary precautions, you can ensure a safe and efficient lightbulb changing experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The hit US spy drama, which has just completed its third season with the first two now out on box set, hits the gold standard of gripping plotting and complex characterisation. The terrorist threat level is on permanent red alert and the CIA is so suffused with terror-paranoia that it subjects a US war hero and its own agents alike to surveillance, harassment and even polygraph tests. \\"When was the last time you told the truth?\\" asks Carrie Mathison, played by Claire Danes. It's a line that haunts every episode. Season one, aired in 2011, hinges on the question: has Gulf war hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), held in an Afghan hole for eight years, been \\"turned\\" by al-Qaida? Lewis won an Emmy for his portrayal of the traumatised marine; Danes won two for her role – hunter to Brody's hunted. As a bipolar intelligence agent Carrie joins a clutch of intense, idiosyncratic female leads in current TV drama (Spiral, The Killing, The Bridge, The Fall). Her judgments are brilliantly unhinged: her CIA mentor, Saul Berenson, calls her \\"the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known\\". Thus Carrie's strategies for outing Brody include wiring his house for sound and vision, like a terrorist Big Brother. This includes the bedroom: surveillance sex-scenes are a regularly disconcerting Homeland trope. Carrie's next choice is to have sex with Brody herself. A truth or dare, double-bluff love affair ensues: will they kiss or kill each other next? When Carrie's question for Brody's polygraph test – \\"Have you ever been unfaithful to your wife?\\" – elicits Brody's unblinking \\"no\\", the paranoia ratchets up again: what else is Brody lying about? Danes' eyes get wider by the episode: Lewis's mouth gets tighter. By the end of season one Carrie's off her meds, off her head – and off the CIA payroll. By contrast, Mandy Patinkin as old agency hand Saul is a study in stillness. Despite another life as a musicals diva, Patinkin is the calm in the eye of the show's hurricane, a microcosm of how Homeland's characterisation anchors its less likely plot lurches. Season two sees computer hacks on a vice-president's pacemaker, al-Qaida kingpins lurking alone in dark tunnels like sci-fi aliens, and CIA bosses blithely listening to their agents having sex with terrorist suspects. Although less credible and, with Carrie on lithium, more conventional, season two is still a mesmerising affair. We watch Brody achieving political office as cohort of a hawkish vice-president (Homeland's neocons arguably come off almost as badly as Muslims). But is Congressman Brody, as Carrie accuses, a \\"terrorist and a traitor\\"? It's hardly a conventional terrorist suspect interrogation that begins: \\"You broke my heart, you know?\\" and ends with an invitation to cohabit. As Carrie and Saul battle to avert a planned attack on the US, knowledge turns out be illusory, victories pyrrhic, while the nature of terror-boss Abu Nazir's plot remains a mystery until the season's closing minutes. And the finish is literally explosive. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is a review of the television show Homeland, which is a spy drama about the CIA and terrorist threats.

Solve 5*b - 35 = 16*b - 134 for b.","completion":"To find the value of b in the given equation, 5b - 35 = 16b - 134, we can use the following steps: Step 1: First, let's work on isolating the variable b by performing the same operations on both sides of the equation to maintain the equality. Step 2: To eliminate the variable term on one side, we can subtract the smaller b coefficient from the larger b coefficient. In this case, we'll subtract 5b from both sides of the equation: (5b - 35) - 5b = (16b - 134) - 5b This simplifies to: -35 = 11b - 134 Step 3: Now, let's isolate b further by adding the constant term on the left side of the equation (in this case, 35) to both sides: -35 + 35 = (11b - 134) + 35 This simplifies to: 0 = 11b - 99 Step 4: To solve for b, we need to eliminate the constant term -99 by adding 99 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 99 = 11b - 99 + 99 This simplifies to: 99 = 11b Step 5: Finally, we want to get b by itself, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of b (which is 11): 99 ÷ 11 = 11b ÷ 11 This simplifies to: 9 = b So, the solution to the equation 5b - 35 = 16b - 134 is b = 9."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb. Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted. Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets. In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attache in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966. Answer this question \\"did they drop a first bomb?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, they dropped a first bomb.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

No more after that!\\" and \\"That's three times he's made the same mistake.\\"?","completion":"To determine whether the word \\"time\\" means the same thing in both sentences, I will examine the context and usage of the word in each sentence. Step 1: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in the first sentence. The first sentence is \\"Okay, but this is the last time. No more after that!\\" In this context, \\"time\\" refers to an instance or occurrence of an event that has been happening and will happen one final instance. It is expressing a limit on the repetition of the event. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in the second sentence. The second sentence is \\"That's three times he's made the same mistake.\\" Here, \\"time\\" is used to quantify the number of occurrences of an event, in this case, making the same mistake. The word \\"times\\" indicates the repetition of the event. Step 3: Compare the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in both sentences. In both cases, \\"time\\" refers to an instance or occurrence of an event. In the first sentence, it is used to set a limit on the repetition of the event, while in the second sentence, it is used to quantify the number of occurrences of an event. While they represent slightly different aspects of instances or occurrences (limiting vs quantifying), both meanings pertain to the repetition of an event. Conclusion: The word \\"time\\" does mean essentially the same thing in both sentences, as it relates to instances or occurrences of an event. However, the focus is slightly different, with the first sentence emphasizing the limit of occurrences and the second sentence quantifying them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It moved half its production to China to keep costs down, but eight years later one company is bringing production back to Britain. It's another example of the backshoring trend that has seen many European manufacturers relocate their business back home. Caldeira is a cushion-making business headquartered in Merseyside, Northern England. Since 2004 it has also had a factory operating in Zhejiang province, China. \\"At the time China was about to be admitted to the WTO and our Chinese competitors were actually selling products cheaper than we could make them\\", said CEO Tony Caldeira. Read more: Chanel's exclusivity keeps it a cut above. According to Caldeira it was an obvious decision for the company at the time. \\"It was a good exchange rate, the salaries were only a tenth of their UK colleagues, a huge labor cost differential between China and the UK.\\" That has now changed; last year manufacturing wages increased by 20 percent according to the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. Since setting up his Chinese factory, Tony Caldeira said his Chinese employees have had wages increase 400 percent. Add to that the increasing costs in shipping, packaging, duty rates and fabric costs, and it's not surprising Chinese production has become less attractive. Read more: Will Greek crisis leave banks stronger? Last year it was cost-effective to make velvet striped cushions in Caldeira's Chinese factory, it cost 90 cents less in production per cushion. However, this year that saving shrank to 13 cents and next year the company predicts it'll cost the same to make the cushion in China and the UK. \\"There are quite a few differences between my Chinese and UK workforces -- the UK employees are more productive, they can make more cushions an hour, however, they work less hours a week. \\"The Chinese want to work more hours, many of them live on site and they just want to earn as much money as possible to send home to their families.\\" Read more: Why Europe needs a banking union. The company faces difficulties finding staff both in Britain and China, but for different reasons. \\"We have been very lucky in the UK as most of our staff have been here for more than 10 years\\", said Caldeira. However, this workforce is much older than the Chinese employees due to a skills shortage. \\"Most of the staff here in the UK are in their 50s or 60s, although they won't like me saying that! They were taught in apprenticeships in the 1970s and 1980s, but those skills aren't being taught now.\\" And while the Chinese workers are younger with manufacturing and sewing machinery skills in abundance, Tony Caldeira said they don't have the same loyalty and there is a high turnover of staff. \\"What you tend to find is people aren't as afraid to move jobs in the Chinese culture, a lot of workers move every year after Chinese New Year, the contracts are only 12 months, so at the end of the year they look for the best contract on the market.\\" Despite the rising costs in Chinese wages, the company won't be looking for another low-cost manufacturing base, for example in Vietnam or Bangladesh. \\"The raw materials are manufactured in China so we'd end up shipping it over, incurring extra costs and complications.\\" As far as Caldeira is concerned, Britain appears to be winning this round of the great pillow fight with China.

Translate to English English:","completion":"\\"Neither the state nor often large companies create them, rather, they tend to decrease jobs.\\" Long Answer: The statement you've asked to translate from Finnish to English seems to touch on a larger discussion about the role of different entities in job creation and elimination. Below, I'll explore this in more detail using your translated sentence as a guide. The translated sentence, \\"Neither the state nor often large companies create them, rather, they tend to decrease jobs,\\" implies a certain skepticism towards the idea that job creation largely depends on government action and the operation of large corporations. The claim suggests that these entities-- the state and large corporations-- do not fulfill the role of establishing opportunities for employment to the extent that many people might expect. The 'state' refers to the government, a body that has a significant influence on job creation through elements such as fiscal policy, regulations, and public services. But, not all governments are able to effectively stimulate job growth for various reasons such as limited resources, policy choices, and more. For instance, during economic downturns, many governments try to create jobs through stimulus programs but the success of such initiatives can vary. Large corporations also play a key role in job creation, especially when they are growing and scaling their operations. However, these corporations may also decrease the number of available jobs, often through mechanisms such as automation, offshoring, or restructuring to increase efficiency. For example, many large manufacturing companies have employed automation technology which requires less manual labor, resulting in job loss. In fact, data from various economies have shown that a high proportion of net new jobs come from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), rather than large corporations or the state. SMEs, are typically more agile and able to adapt to market changes, and also have greater capacity to innovate, leading to new sectors and jobs being created. Therefore, while it's undeniable that the state and large companies have a role to play in job creation, it's also important to recognize the part of smaller entities and entrepreneurship in driving employment. Understanding the dynamics of job creation and elimination can inform policies and initiatives aiming to address unemployment and underemployment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: Information: - Convivio ( The Banquet ) is a work written by Dante Alighieri roughly between 1304 and 1307 . This unfinished work of Dante consists of four trattati , or \`\` books '' : a prefatory one , plus three books that each include a canzone ( long lyrical poem ) and a prose allegorical interpretation or commentary of the poem that goes off in multiple thematic directions . The Convivio is a major stage of development for Dante , very different from the visionary world of the Vita nuova ( although like the earlier work it too is a medium for the author 's evolving sense of artistic vocation and philosophical - spiritual quest ) . This difference is reflected in how the two works use the prosimetrum format : in the Vita Nova there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry , while in the Convivio large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems ; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically , to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the Convivio discusses . Dante himself tells us that the prose of the Convivio is \`\` temperate and virile , '' in contrast to the \`\` fervid and passionate '' prose of the Vita Nova ; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was \`\` like dreaming '' the Convivio approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake , often modeling its style on Scholastic authors . The Convivio is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante 's time ; it touches on many areas of learning , not only philosophy but also politics , linguistics , science , and history . The treatise begins with the prefatory book , or proem , which explains why a book like the Convivio is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin . It is one of Dante 's early defenses of the vernacular , expressed in greater detail in his ( slightly earlier ) linguistic treatise De vulgari eloquentia ( On Eloquence in the Vernacular ) .

Often used in the past primarily for masterpieces of Western European literature, world literature today is increasingly seen in global context. Readers today have access to an unprecedented range of works from around the world in excellent translations, and since the mid-1990s a lively debate has grown up concerning both the aesthetic and the political values and limitations of an emphasis on global processes over national traditions. - Italian (or \\"lingua italiana\\" ) is a Romance language. It is the second-closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary after Sardinian. Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). It used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, where it is still widely spoken, as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is spoken by small minorities in places such as France (especially in Corsica), Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Crimea and Tunisia and by large expatriate communities in the Americas. Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages. Italian is the fourth most studied language in the world. - The Divine Comedy is a poem by Dante Alighieri, begun and completed 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: \\"Inferno\\", \\"Purgatorio\\", and \\"Paradiso\\". - The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history generally comprising the 14th and 15th centuries (c. 13011500). The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance). - Durante degli Alighieri, simply called Dante (, ; c. 1265 1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages.

News article: WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran on Monday dismissed an angry warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Tehran risked dire consequences “the like of which few throughout history have suffered before” if it made threats against the United States. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back at Trump’s warning, which the U.S. leader delivered written in capital letters in a late-night tweet. “COLOR US UNIMPRESSED: The world heard even harsher bluster a few months ago. And Iranians have heard them - albeit more civilized ones - for 40 yrs. We’ve been around for millennia & seen fall of empires, incl our own, which lasted more than the life of some countries,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. “BE CAUTIOUS!” he wrote in capital letters, echoing exact words from Trump. Iran has been under increasing U.S. pressure and possible sanctions since Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from a 2015 agreement between world powers and Iran over its disputed nuclear program. Bitter foes since Iran’s 1979 revolution, Washington and Tehran have cranked up talk of war in recent days. The Trump administration has launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure Iran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups. Despite the heightened rhetoric, both sides have reasons to want to avoid starting a conflict. Trump’s words appeared to be in response to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying that hostile policies toward Tehran could lead to “the mother of all wars.” In his tweet directed at Rouhani, Trump wrote: “Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. Be cautious!” Rouhani had told a gathering of Iranian diplomats on Sunday: “Mr Trump, don’t play with the lion’s tail, this would only lead to regret.” “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,” said Rouhani, quoted by the state news agency IRNA. “OBVIOUS MISTAKE” Trump is under pressure from U.S. lawmakers for taking too soft a line against Russia in a summit last week with President Vladimir Putin. “President Trump has failed to assure Americans he would side with us over Russia. To distract from the Helsinki disaster, he has launched a childish all-caps Twitter tirade against Iran. Barstool threats don’t make us safe, they make us look silly and weak,” said Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Trump’s Iran tweet resembled ones he issued last year to warn North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. But in June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the first U.S.-North Korean summit. After the meeting both sides declared a new friendship and made vague pledges of nuclear disarmament. At the White House, Trump later on Monday said, “none at all,” in response to a shouted question about whether he had any concerns about provoking tensions with Iran. Although Rouhani left open the possibility of peace between Tehran and Washington, Iran’s most powerful authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday ruled out negotiations with the United States as an “obvious mistake.” There is limited appetite in Washington for a conflict with Iran, not least because of the difficulties the U.S. military faced in Iraq after its 2003 invasion but also because of the impact on the global economy if conflict raised oil prices. Many ordinary Iranians are worried that the war of words might lead to a military confrontation but insiders in Tehran told Reuters they believed the Trump administration would not drag the United States into another quagmire in the Middle East. With popular discontent over Iran’s faltering economy and sliding currency, and the prospect of tough new U.S. sanctions, Iran’s leaders have called for unity. The Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Monday amid fears of a military confrontation. The dollar was being offered for as much as 92,000 rials, compared to around 75,000 last week. Many Iranians are largely skeptical of the Trump administration’s professed support for Iranian citizens because of the harsh U.S. sanctions on the country and a visa ban imposed on Iranians barring them from entering the United States. While Washington prepares to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran after pulling out of the nuclear deal, Iran’s faction-ridden religious and political elites have closed ranks against Trump’s hawkish approach to Tehran. However, growing strains with the United States will eventually boost Rouhani’s anti-Western hardline rivals who fear losing power if the nuclear accord, championed by Rouhani, ended the country’s political and economic isolation. While the United States has a substantial military presence in the region, a full-scale military confrontation with Iran would be a major, costly endeavor that could eclipse the U.S. war in Iraq. It could also distract from other U.S. national security priorities, including Russia and North Korea. In reaction to Iran’s threats, the U.S. military has renewed a vow to secure the free flow of oil from the Strait of Hormuz. However, at least as of last week, the Pentagon said those Iranian threats had not led the U.S. military to reposition or add to forces in the Middle East.

(Associated Press) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranians on Monday shrugged off the possibility that a bellicose exchange of words between President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart could escalate into military conflict, but expressed growing concern America's stepped-up sanctions could damage their fragile economy. In his latest salvo, Trump tweeted late on Sunday that hostile threats from Iran could bring dire consequences. This was after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani remarked earlier in the day that \\"American must understand well that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\\" Trump tweeted: \\"NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKE OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.\\" Within hours, Iran's state-owned news agency IRNA dismissed the tweet, describing it as a \\"passive reaction\\" to Rouhani's remarks. On Tehran streets, residents took the exchange in stride. \\"Both America and Iran have threatened one another in different ways for several years,\\" shrugged Mohsen Taheri, a 58-year-old publisher. A headline on a local newspaper quoted Rouhani as saying: \\"Mr. Trump, do not play with the lion's tail.\\" Prominent Iranian political analyst Seed Leilaz downplayed the war of words, saying it was in his opinion \\"the storm before the calm.\\" Leilaz told The Associated Press he was not \\"worried about the remarks and tweets,\\" and that \\"neither Iran, nor any other country is interested in escalating tensions in the region.\\" Citing harsh words the United States and North Korea had exchanged before the high-profile summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Leilaz said Trump and Kim got \\"closer\\" despite the warring words. Meanwhile, Trump's tweet was reverberating across the Mideast. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the U.S. president's \\"strong stance\\" after years in which the Iranian \\"regime was pampered by world powers.\\" Trump earlier this year pulled the U.S. out of the international deal meant to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon and ordered increased American sanctions, as well as threatening penalties for companies from other countries that continue to do business with Iran. With the economic pressure, Trump said earlier this month that \\"at a certain point they're going to call me and say 'let's make a deal,' and we'll make a deal.\\" Iran has rejected talks with the U.S., and Rouhani has accused the U.S. of stoking an \\"economic war.\\" Rouhani also suggested Iran could immediately ramp up its production of uranium in response to U.S. pressure. Potentially that would escalate the very situation the nuclear deal sought to avoid — an Iran with a stockpile of enriched uranium that could lead to making atomic bombs. Trump's tweet suggested he has little patience with the trading of hostile messages with Iran, using exceptionally strong language and writing the all-capitalized tweet. \\"WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!,\\" he wrote. Another Tehran resident, Mehdi Naderi, fretted that the U.S. measures and his own government's policies are damaging the lives of the average Iranian. \\"America is threatening the Iranian people with its sanctions and our government is doing the same with its incompetence and mismanagement,\\" said the self-employed 35-year-old. Trump has a history of firing off heated tweets that seem to quickly escalate long-standing disputes with leaders of nations at odds with the U.S. In the case of North Korea, the public war of words cooled quickly and gradually led to the high profile summit and denuclearization talks. There has been little tangible progress in a global push to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons program since the historic Trump-Kim summit on June 12. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Pyongyang for follow-up talks earlier this month, but the two sides showed conflicting accounts of the talks. North's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of making \\"gangster-like\\" demands for its unilateral disarmament. Some experts say Kim is using diplomacy as a way to win outside concessions and weaken U.S.-led international sanctions. Many in Iran have expressed frustration that Trump has seemed willing to engage with North Korea, which has openly boasted of producing nuclear weapons, but not Iran, which signed the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since Trump pulled out of the deal, other nations involved — Germany, Britain, France, Russia and China as well as the European Union — have reaffirmed their support for the deal and have been working to try and keep Iran on board. \\"Iran is angry since Trump responded to Tehran's engagement diplomacy by pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal,\\" Iranian lawmaker Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh told the AP. He added, however, the war of words between the two presidents was to be expected, since official diplomatic relations between the two countries have been frozen for decades. \\"They express themselves through speeches since diplomatic channels are closed,\\" said Falahatpisheh who heads the influential parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy. On Sunday in California, Pompeo was strongly critical of Iran, calling its religious leaders \\"hypocritical holy men\\" who amassed vast sums of wealth while allowing their people to suffer. In the speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, Pompeo castigated Iran's political, judicial and military leaders, accusing several by name of participating in widespread corruption. He also said the government has \\"heartlessly repressed its own people's human rights, dignity and fundamental freedoms.\\" He said despite poor treatment by their leaders, \\"the proud Iranian people are not staying silent about their government's many abuses,\\" Pompeo said. \\"And the United States under President Trump will not stay silent either.\\" ___ Lester reported from Washington. Associated Press writers David Rising in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, Aron Heller in Jerusalem and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report. ||||| To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.

Question: A girl noticed she could slide further while wearing her socks on the vinyl kitchen floor the morning after her mother waxed it then she could at the end of the week, when it had warn off. This is because the waxed kitchen floor had _____ then when the wax was worn off. (A) less friction (B) more friction Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is (A) less friction. The reason the girl was able to slide further on the waxed vinyl floor compared to when the wax had worn off is due to the difference in the friction between her socks and the floor's surface. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. In this scenario, the friction is occurring between the girl's socks and the vinyl floor. Frictional forces are influenced by both the surface roughness and the material properties of the two objects in contact. When the vinyl floor is freshly waxed, a thin, smooth layer of wax covers the surface, creating a more slippery and smoother surface compared to when the wax has worn off. This smoother surface results in less interaction between the microscopic irregularities of the floor and the girl's socks, leading to a reduction in friction. As a consequence, she can slide further on the waxed floor. As the week progresses and the wax wears off, the surface becomes rougher, increasing the contact points between the floor and her socks. This increased contact leads to an increase in friction, which opposes her motion more effectively, causing her to slide for a shorter distance on the now worn-off vinyl floor. In conclusion, the waxed kitchen floor had less friction than when the wax was worn off, enabling the girl to slide further on the freshly waxed vinyl floor compared to when the wax had worn off at the end of the week."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In the given situation, two farms were affected by winds that destroyed their crops. Hill farm took action by installing windbreaks to mitigate the impacts of wind on their crops. Windbreaks serve as barriers that reduce wind velocity over and around crops, thereby increasing crop yields due to reduced drying and protection from strong wind gusts. On the other hand, Valley farm did not have the funds to install windbreaks and decided to postpone the project. By not having windbreaks at their farm, the wind velocity over their crops remains unchanged and unprotected. This means that Valley farm's crops will continue to be vulnerable to drying and damage from strong winds, which can negatively affect crop yields.

Premise: 'I hear you tell of men's futures,' I asked her. The speaker is stating that they have heard that the person they're addressing (a woman in this case) tells men's futures. This implies that the speaker has been informed or has knowledge about this woman's ability to predict or share information about the future, specifically related to men. Hypothesis: He asked if she told men's futures. The hypothesis suggests that the speaker (identified as a male in this case) has questioned the woman about her ability to reveal men's futures.

Longest-serving: Kay Burley marked her 28-year. television career by claiming her longevity proves older women can still. succeed on the small screen. Newsreader Kay Burley has marked her 28-year television career by claiming her longevity proves older women can still succeed on the small screen. The 52-year-old Sky News broadcaster has been on camera for a total of 20,000 hours and is the longest-serving British news presenter still working. Speaking at the Breast Cancer Care lunch at Champneys Tring health spa, she said: ‘I’m 53 in December and I’ve just signed another five-year contract, so I think that probably blows a few holes in the argument of people who say that older women can’t be a success in television. 'I’m the longest-serving British newsreader. That’s quite a lot of longevity, isn’t it? ‘I was staggered, to be honest … and apparently I’ve also done more live broadcasting than anybody else in the world.’ ‘Apparently there is some chap in America who’s done about 16,000 hours and apparently I’ve done 20,000 hours. Isn’t it amazing? It’s incredible. I can’t believe it. ‘It feels like yesterday that I joined the company. I suppose it’s because it doesn’t feel like work because I love my job, I love what I do for a living. ‘I’m not expecting a trophy, I’m just safe in the knowledge that I can continue to do for another five years the best job in the world. I love my job and I’m very lucky and privileged to be able to do it. ‘I’m very content to be with Sky. I was there when it was just great big potholes in the car park, and now we have something like 130 million viewers around the world. I was recently on safari on holiday and I was recognised on the Zimbabwe/Botswana border, which was a bit weird but it made me think, “We reach all of these people”.’ At a Breast Cancer Care lunch she hit back at critics such as Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters should not complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women. Miss Burley, who admits making a series of high-profile blunders during her live broadcasts, recently signed a new contract which will keep her at Sky until she is 57. Shining example: Miss Burley, who has clocked up. a phenomenal 20,000 hours on screen, meets Prime Minister David Cameron. at a Downing Street reception to celebrate the achievements of women in. the media. 'It feels like yesterday that I joined the company': And she has just signed another five-year contract. She began her career on the Evening Post and Chronicle in Wigan in 1978 before working in local radio and television. She. joined TV-am in 1985 as a reporter and breakfast TV presenter. She. joined Sky News in 1988, helping launch the channel three months later. She. currently presents Sky News from 2-5pm, and has covered some of the. world’s biggest news stories including the death of Princess Diana, the. Asian Tsunami and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for which she won a BAFTA. award. Covering all the big news: Miss Burley reported on the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Consummate professional: And she was part of the media scrum outside the Lindo Wing of St. George's Hospital, London, where to reporting the birth of her grandson, Prince. George, this summer. However, she made a series of widely-publicised gaffes during her career, including mistakenly mocking US Vice President Joe Biden for marking his forehead with ashes on Ash Wednesday. She told viewers it looked like he had ‘walked into a door’. She grabbed a photographer by the throat during the scrum that greeted Naomi Campbell’s court appearance in 2008, and was labelled ‘a bit dim’ during a clash with Labour MP Chris Bryant. She said: ‘I’ve had so many bloopers. I’ve no idea where to start. There’s a great quote that goes “Doctors. bury their mistakes, lawyers lock theirs up, and television presenters. broadcast theirs”, and it’s true. ‘Of. course you make mistakes. You can’t be the longest-serving newsreader. in the world and not make mistakes, but the key is to get back on the. horse’. Big break: Miss Burley, second from right, with colleagues on breakfast programme TV-AM, which she joined as a reporter in 1985. Career progression: Miss Burley pictured in the Sky News newsroom in 1989, after she joined a year earlier. Talking about ageism. in the past, Miss Burley admitted she had never been a victim, but said. she would follow former BBC presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who successfully. sued the BBC for age discrimination and victimisation after she was. dropped as a presenter of Countryfile at the age of 51 in 2009. She said: ‘Ageism and sexism have passed me by - but if it happened, I’d fight it like Miriam O’Reilly did.’ Glamour puss: She hit back at critics like Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters shouldn't complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women. Talking about retiring from television, she once admitted: ‘I sometimes dream of a life in the country with my chickens, growing vegetables. That would be heaven one day, but not yet.’ Britain’s longest-ever serving newsreader is Peter Sissons, who retired from the BBC at the age of 66 in 2009 after 31 years as a newscaster.

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Write a title for this article: Returning to work after maternity leave is a huge stressor for many first time moms, not only because of the logistical hoops you have to jump through to re-arrange your work life around your new baby, but it can also fill women with self-doubt about their roles as career woman and mom. It also seems to come way too quickly. Some experts believe that women need about four months of maternity leave before they’re ready to come back, but many women only get six to eight weeks. Here’s how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Performing at Work • Ease the transition. Experts recommend starting in the middle of the week, so your first work week is short. It is also becoming more common for women to arrange to work one or two days the first week or so, or come in for a shorter day for the first two or three days to help ease the transition. The smoother your transition, the more productive you’ll be at work, says Chris Essex, director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville, Md. • Tone down the baby talk—or not! A lot of women fear if they talk about their babies at work, people will assume they wish they were home instead of working. “Yet talking about your baby can build connections to people in the workplace,” says Jamie Ladge, assistant professor in management at Northeastern University in Boston. “People talk about their personal lives all the time at work, so it’s natural to talk about your kids.\\" But use your judgment. If you intuit that your co-workers won’t be receptive or can’t relate, then keep the cute baby stories to a minimum. • Give yourself time to adjust. Don’t think you need to reconsider your options if your first few weeks back are rocky. “When women come back to work, they’re in a lot of flux, trying to integrate how they are as a professional with their new role as a mother,” Ladge says. It may take some time to adjust to your new identity and learn how to juggle work and home responsibilities. • Ask for flex time. More and more women and men are negotiating schedules that are less rigid and can ease the stresses with working 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. “You may fear that people will think less of you if you ask, but if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” Ladge says. Talk to other employees who may have been down the same road to see what type of arrangements they have. • Ignore the comments. People can say overtly or covertly stereotypical things, which can fill you with self doubt. A seasoned mother might say, “I cried and cried when I came back to work,” making you question what kind of mom you are since you didn’t shed a tear. A boss might say, “I hope you’re not one of those women who aren’t 100 percent committed now that you have a baby.” Just laugh it off. And don’t work twice as hard to prove them wrong. • Be clear with your supervisors. Be communicative about what you want from your job and what your ambitions are so that you don’t get sidelined for promotions because of inaccurate assumptions about you now that you’re a mom. Juggling • You’ll be exhausted. If there’s a time you could use the support of your parents or some extra paid help, it is when you’re transitioning back to work. If you can get some help with cleaning and cooking during this time, it can help you feel less frazzled. • Plan the morning routine. One of the most critical issues is the division of labor between you and your spouse. Who will take showers when, who will watch the baby, feed the baby, and get the baby to child care. Ditto for dinnertime and pickup. “You and your spouse need to work it out in advance because it’s hard to negotiate when you’re tired or in the middle of a hectic schedule,” Essex says. • Alternate nighttime feedings. If you handle all the middle-of-the night feedings, you’ll be exhausted in the morning. Try to alternate nights with your husband. • Don’t try to be super-mom. Understand that you may not be able to do everything like you used to. Some things may fall by the wayside, like a perfectly clean house, or home-cooked dinners every night. Missing Your Baby • Get acclimated to child care. Test drive your child care for at least three days before going back to work to give you and your baby time to adjust. That can lower your anxiety level about your child’s transition. “Having good child care that makes you feel confident is key and reminding yourself that your baby is safe and loved will really help,” says Murphy Daly, author of The Pregnant Professional. • Do a dress rehearsal. Prior to the first day back, get all the stuff ready, have the feeding and napping things packed and ready to go,” Daly says. “Take baby to childcare and then go get your personal grooming done while you practice being away.\\" • Check in with your child care once a day. For some people, checking in may make it harder, so tailor the advice to what works for you. Some women like to have pictures of the baby at work, while for others, it may make the transition more difficult. • Don’t be surprised to miss your baby. Try not to assume that something is wrong with your work ethic for wanting to be home with your baby rather than working. Women often feel pulled in both directions, so it’s more about getting used to wanting to be in both places at once. • Think about a breastfeeding plan. If you are breastfeeding, you should start pumping and freezing milk about a month before you go back to work. Make sure you have a private place to pump at work.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups (when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). For another, his concealing of one important information: the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film. That is, goitre, a sickness caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research (heck, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre') he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as 'cretins', again and again, dramatizing the action, setting-up scenes to create the spectacle, all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not letting one word to the people he is filming. He talks FOR them and, even then, JUDGES them. This piece is flawed to it's roots, to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. To justify this conclusion, let's analyze the review step by step: 1. The reviewer critiques the filmmaker's claims of objectivity, using specific examples of scenes they believe to be staged. This demonstrates skepticism and doubt about the film's authenticity. 2. They point out that an important piece of information (i.e., the cause of the people's cretinism - goitre) is left out, adding to their argument that the film is not objective. 3. The reviewer accuses the filmmaker of judging the people in the film and being overly critical, something they find unacceptable for a documentarist claiming objectivity. 4. There's an emphasis on how the filmmaker \\"talks all the time,” speaking for the people and often judging them, which makes the review even more negative. 5. Lastly, the reviewer concludes that the film is flawed and doesn't understand why it's considered a great film. Overall, the sentiment of this review is definitely negative, as the reviewer expresses doubts about the film's integrity, authenticity, and overall message."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What country with two words suffered from attacks inside it?\\" Context: \\"The Persian Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The country with two words that suffered from attacks inside it during the Persian Gulf War is Saudi Arabia. In the context provided, the war was primarily fought between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The conflict resulted in a decisive victory for the U.S.-led coalition forces, who drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition casualties. While the main battles occurred within the borders of Iraq and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, which shares borders with both countries, also experienced direct attacks. As a significant regional power and prominent member of the coalition against Iraq, Saudi Arabia was targeted by Iraqi forces throughout the conflict. Iraqi troops launched missile attacks on several major Saudi Arabian cities as part of their retaliation strategy, aiming to cause destruction and instill fear in their opponents. Alongside missile attacks, Saudi Arabia's border regions were also threatened by the potential spillover of ground combat, which led to the deployment of coalition troops throughout the country. Although land combat did not expand beyond the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, the presence of U.S. and allied forces within Saudi Arabia was vital in defending against potential incursions from Iraqi forces. In addition to direct attacks, Saudi Arabia played a crucial logistical role for coalition forces during the Persian Gulf War. The country provided bases for both aerial and ground troops, as well as equipment and resources to support the war effort. Therefore, despite not being the primary theater of war, Saudi Arabia was an essential participant in the conflict and experienced attacks within its territory as a result of its involvement in the coalition efforts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation -273*w - 13 = -260*w. Now, to solve for 'w', we need to get it all by itself on one side. First, let's add 260*w to both sides to move the -260w over. Imagine having -273 cookies and then adding 260 cookies: -273*w + 260*w - 13 = -260*w + 260*w This simplifies to: -13*w - 13 = 0 (since -260*w + 260*w cancels each other out) Now, let's get rid of the -13 that is just hanging around with the w. To do that, we have to add 13 to both sides. Imagine having -13 stickers and then you get 13 more: -13*w - 13 + 13 = 0 + 13 This simplifies to: -13*w = 13 Good! Now the 'w' is almost all alone. We just have that -13 left to get rid of. Since it's multiplied by 'w', so let's do the opposite and divide by -13. Think of it as splitting 13 candies among -13 friends: -13*w / -13 = 13 / -13 This simplifies to: w = -1 And there you have it! We solved the puzzle! The value of 'w' is -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception.

Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process.

For Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to \\"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history\\". Culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture. Non-material culture refers to the non physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief system, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions. While Material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make, or have made.

A country scores higher HDI when the life expectancy at birth is longer, the education period is longer, and the income per capita is higher. The HDI was developed by the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \\"be\\" and \\"do\\" desirable things in their life, and was published by the United Nations Development Programme.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Mahbub ul Haq's ideas, particularly the Human Development Index (HDI), were primarily promoted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Under Mahbub ul Haq's leadership and collaboration with Indian economist Amartya Sen, the UNDP introduced the HDI in their annual Human Development Reports starting in 1990. By incorporating the HDI into their reports, the UNDP placed the focus on human-centered development, rather than just relying on purely economic measures such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Write an article based on this \\"Get an STD test. Seek treatment. Prevent outbreaks in the future.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Importance of STD Testing, Treatment, and Prevention for a Healthier Future Introduction: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a significant public health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection, treatment, and prevention are crucial in minimizing the impact of these infections on individuals and communities. This article will discuss the importance of getting tested for STDs, seeking appropriate treatment, and taking steps to prevent future outbreaks. 1. Get an STD Test: The First Step Towards Better Sexual Health Many STDs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus (HPV), often show little or no symptoms, making it difficult for individuals to know they are infected. Regular testing is essential in detecting these stealthy infections and ensuring that treatment is not delayed. Taking a proactive approach and getting regularly tested for STDs will help: a) Identify asymptomatic infections – Discovering an infection early allows for prompt treatment and prevents complications. b) Prevent transmission to others – Knowing your STD status allows you to make informed choices to protect yourself and others. c) Encourage open communication – Discussing STD testing with partners promotes honesty and trust within relationships. 2. Seek Treatment: A Vital Step for Recovery and Prevention of Complications Once an STD is identified, seeking appropriate treatment is the next essential step in managing the infection and avoiding potential health repercussions. Timely treatment ensures: a) Reduced likelihood of complications – Untreated STDs can lead to severe health issues such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and increased risk of HIV transmission. b) Prevention of transmission – Effective treatment can minimize the risk of passing the infection to others. c) Improved overall health – Treating STDs aids in maintaining a strong immune system, enabling your body to effectively combat other infections. 3. Prevent Outbreaks in the Future: Strategies to Safeguard Your Sexual Health Preventing future STD outbreaks not only protects your well-being but also contributes to the overall health of the community. Consider these essential preventive measures: a) Practice safe sex – Consistently using barrier methods such as condoms can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and transmitting STDs. b) Get vaccinated – Immunizations are available for certain STDs such as HPV and hepatitis B. Consult your healthcare provider to determine which vaccines are appropriate for you. c) Maintain open communication – Honest conversations about sexual histories, testing, and condom usage encourage partners to make responsible choices for their mutual sexual health. d) Get regularly tested – Early detection and treatment are crucial in breaking the cycle of transmission and preventing the spread of STDs. Conclusion: Taking responsibility for your sexual health is essential for maintaining overall well-being and contributing to healthier communities. By getting regularly tested for STDs, seeking timely treatment when needed, and employing preventive strategies, individuals can play a crucial role in controlling the spread of these infections. Don't let fear or embarrassment stand in your way; prioritize your health and the well-being of others by getting tested, talking openly with partners, and practicing safe sex. Together, we can work towards a future with fewer STD outbreaks and healthier sexual experiences for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To fully understand why \\"marching band\\" is the correct answer, it is essential to briefly describe and differentiate the given options: 1. Music store: A music store is a retail business that primarily sells musical instruments, sheet music, and related accessories. It is not a performing group and therefore does not require members to participate in choreographed field performances. 2. Actors: Actors are individuals who perform in various mediums, such as theater, film, and television. While some actors may be skilled in singing, dancing, or playing instruments, they typically do not participate in a choreographed group performance incorporating a specific musical instrument like the saxophone. 3. Store sells instruments: This option is similar to the music store, as it refers to a retail establishment that sells musical instruments. It does not pertain to any form of performance or choreographed movements. 4. Marching band: A marching band is a group of musicians, typically associated with high schools, colleges, or other organizations, who perform in various settings such as parades, halftime shows at sporting events, and field competitions. Members of a marching band typically play brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments while executing choreographed routines. This option perfectly aligns with the given context of playing the saxophone and performing choreographed moves on the field. 5. Orchestra: An orchestra is a large ensemble of musicians who play various instruments, primarily strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. While orchestras perform concerts and accompany various productions such as operas and ballets, their members typically remain stationary during the performances and do not participate in any choreographed movements on the field. Based on the descriptions above, it is clear that \\"marching band\\" is the correct answer. The individual, in this case, is not only playing the saxophone but is also learning choreographed moves to perform on the field with the group. This unique combination of musical and physical performance is a hallmark of marching bands, setting them apart from other musical ensembles and organizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 2. Isolate the variable 'l' on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for 'l'. Step 1: Combine like terms. -581*l - 173*l can be combined as they are like terms (both have the variable 'l'): (-581 - 173) * l = -754*l The equation now becomes: -93*l - 1449 = -754*l + 15076 Step 2: Make 'l' terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Add 754*l to both sides of the equation to move the terms with 'l' to the left side: (-93*l + 754*l) - 1449 = 15076 (661*l) - 1449 = 15076 Now, we isolate the constant terms on the right side of the equation. Add 1449 to both sides: 661*l - 1449 + 1449 = 15076 + 1449 661*l = 16525 Step 3: Solve for 'l'. Divide both sides of the equation by 661 to find the value of 'l': l = 16525 / 661 l ≈ 25 The solution to the equation -93*l - 1449 = -581*l - 173*l + 15076 is l ≈ 25."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose I have asthma now happens, how will it affect I cannot catch my breath. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of having asthma can have a direct effect on the process of breathing and talking. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing. In this scenario, the presence of asthma may affect your ability to catch your breath in the following ways: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs: The inflamed and narrowed airways in asthma can cause resistance to airflow during inhalation, making it harder to draw air into the lungs. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: In asthma, the reduced airflow due to airway constriction may lead to less oxygen reaching the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. Consequently, the oxygen transfer from the lungs to the bloodstream could be diminished, potentially leading to a decrease in oxygen saturation in the blood. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal cords: The presence of asthma can also affect the exhalation process, as the narrowed airways make it difficult to expel air from the lungs. This may cause shortness of breath, which may interrupt the natural flow of air through the vocal cords, making it challenging for a person to effectively and comfortably produce speech. 4. A person talks: As previously mentioned, the difficulty in breathing caused by asthma may make it more challenging for a person to effectively talk, particularly if they are experiencing an asthma attack. The person may need to pause or stop talking altogether to catch their breath. 5. Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment: Due to the constriction and inflammation of the airways, it takes more effort to force air out of the lungs with asthma. This can lead to shortness of breath and difficulty exhaling fully, which can contribute to a feeling of not being able to catch one's breath. In conclusion, the perturbation of having asthma can directly affect the process of breathing and talking, making it harder for a person to catch their breath. Asthma can impact airflow during inhalation and exhalation, oxygen transfer to the bloodstream, and consequently, a person's ability to communicate through speech."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can purchase hanging pots and hooks from any home and garden store. Hanging plants are both attractive and cat-proof! You can find deterrent sprays in the pet store that won't harm your plant, but will discourage your cat from poking around it. A good example of a safe product is “Get Off,” but always make sure to check the label before buying a deterrent product. Some of these sprays might actually hurt your plant. You can make your own deterrent spray at home, as well. Make a mixture of one part vinegar to three parts water, and spritz it onto the leaves of your plant. Cats hate the smell, and it doesn't hurt your plant! This is best done with \\"remote punishment.\\" The idea is to make the cat associate approaching the plant with something bad, like getting sprayed in the face with water. However, you don't want the cat to associate the punishment with you. You want your cat to think the punishment came out of nowhere. Booby trap the plant by using putting a can of compressed air that's activated by a motion sensor near it. These pet-training aids can be purchased in pet stores or online. When your cat approaches plant, he'll get a blast of compressed air. This doesn't hurt him, but it'll make him think twice about approaching the plant again. For example, if you spray the cat with water or shout at him, your cat will associate the punishment with you. He may well stop eating the plant when you're around, but he'll probably keep doing what he wants when you're out of the room. Punishing the cat yourself actually makes him more devious. He also might grow a little frightened of you, which isn't the relationship you want with your pet. Put tin foil down around the plant, or a plastic carpet protector with the knobby side up. Your cat may not be willing to walk across an unpleasant surface to get to your plants. Collect and wash out empty cans — whether for canned vegetables or soft drinks. Line them up along the edge of the table where you keep your plants, then add more rows on top to form a wall. When your cat jumps up and knocks them down, the noisy clamor will send him flying. He'll think twice about approaching your plants after enough scares. This might sound quirky, but products like Silent Roar contain lion feces. Though you won't be able to smell it, your cat will, and he'll get the message that a powerful stranger has already claimed the plant as part of his territory.","completion":"The article provides various methods to discourage cats from interfering with houseplants; these include using hanging pots and hooks, deterrent sprays (purchased or homemade vinegar mixture), remote punishment techniques such as motion activated compressed air, creating physical barriers using unpleasant surfaces or noisy cans, and introducing scent deterrents such as lion feces.

In her rejection letter to the prestigious Magdalen College, Nowell pointed out an \\"obvious gap\\" between the representation of minorities and white middle-class students, which she found \\"embarrassing.\\" This observation raises questions about the university's focus on diversity and inclusivity when it comes to student enrollment. The college has been under scrutiny due to similar concerns in the past, showing that Nowell's critique is both timely and relevant. By choosing not to attend Magdalen College, she is setting an example for other young people and encouraging them to analyze their educational prospects critically, taking into account factors beyond just rankings and reputation. Nowell's decision also highlights the importance of a diverse student body for an enriching educational experience. Academic institutions should strive for a degree of representation that reflects the society in which they are located, fostering an environment where students of different backgrounds can learn from and support one another.

Estonia has around 600,000 employees, yet the country has a shortage of skilled labor, and since skill shortages are experienced everywhere in Europe, the government has increased working visa quota for non-EEA citizens, although it has nevertheless been criticized for being inadequate for addressing the shortages. The late-2000s recession in the world, the near-concurrent local property bust with changes in Estonian legislation to increase labour market flexibility saw Estonia's unemployment rate shoot up to 18.8% throughout the duration of the crisis, then stabilise to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances. Some of the reduction in unemployment has been attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere. After the recession, the unemployment rate went lower, and throughout 2015 and 2016, the rate stayed near the levels that preceded the economic downturn, staying at just above 6%. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many percentage points higher did Estonia's unemployment rate peak at compared to the 13.8% it stabiized at?","completion":"To find the difference in percentage points between the peak unemployment rate and the stabilized rate, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the peak unemployment rate. From the text, we find that Estonia's unemployment rate peaked at 18.8% during the crisis. Step 2: Identify the stabilized unemployment rate. The text states that the unemployment rate stabilized at 13.8% by summer 2011. Step 3: Calculate the difference in percentage points. To find the difference, we can subtract the stabilized rate from the peak rate: 18.8% (peak) - 13.8% (stabilized) = 5% So, Estonia's unemployment rate peaked at 5 percentage points higher compared to the 13.8% it stabilized at."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - making babies - bliss - unwanted pregnancy - aids - orgasm Explain why a human would choose \\"aids\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"aids\\" as the answer to the question above because twenty years ago, the stigma surrounding gay sex and the lack of awareness and education about safe sex practices within the LGBTQ+ community were significant issues. This led to increased risks associated with the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including AIDS. In the 1980s and 1990s, the AIDS epidemic disproportionately affected the gay community, especially gay men. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), once contracted, can progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a severe, life-threatening condition. At that time, HIV/AIDS was not as well-understood as it is today, and there were limited treatment options available. The prejudice and social stigma surrounding the LGBTQ+ community also played a role in this health crisis. Discrimination, misinformation, and fear surrounding HIV/AIDS led to further marginalization and isolation of gay men, hampering prevention efforts and access to healthcare. There was also a lack of information about safe sex practices, which contributed to the spread of HIV among gay men. Many people were uninformed about the importance of using protection like condoms during any sexual activity, and getting regularly tested for HIV and other STIs. This lack of awareness and education led to risky sexual behaviors and a higher likelihood of contracting HIV. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"aids\\" as the answer to the question of what having sex as a gay man led to twenty years ago because during that period, there was a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS due to the social stigma, lack of awareness about safe sex practices, and limited treatment options. The situation has vastly improved since then, with better education, acceptance, and advances in medical research and treatments for HIV/AIDS. However, it is still critical to remember the importance of safe sex practices and regular testing in promoting overall sexual health."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following context: After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea. answer the following question: What is the full name of the birds that wintered together?
