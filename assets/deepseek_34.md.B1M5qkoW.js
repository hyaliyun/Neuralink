Article: Arriving in Sydney on his own from India, my husband ,Rashid, stayed in a hotel for a short time while looking for a house for me and our children. During the first week of his stay, he went out one day to do some shopping. He came back in the late afternoon to discover that his suitcase was gone. He was extremely worried as the suitcase had all his important papers, including his passport. He reported the case to the police and then sat there,lost and lonely in strange city, thinking of the terrible troubles of getting all the paperwork organized again from a distant country while trying to settle down in a new one. Late in the evening, the phone rang. It was a stranger. He was trying to pronounce my husband's name and was asking him a lot of questions. Then he said they had found a pile of papers in their trash can that had been left out on the footpath. My husband rushed to their home to find a kind family holding all his papers and documents. Their young daughter had gone to the trash can and found a pile of unfamiliar papers. Her parents had carefully sorted them out, although they had found mainly foreign addresses on most of the documents. At last they had seen a half-written letter in the pile in which my husband had given his new telephone number to a friend. That family not only _ the important documents to us that day but also restoredour faith and trust in people.We still remember their kindness and often send a warm wish their way. Question: Which of the following can be the best title for the text? Answer: Available options: A). From India to Australia.. B). Living in a a New Country.. C). Turning Trash to Treasure.. D). In Search of New Friends.. The answer is:","completion":"C). Turning Trash to Treasure. This title is the most fitting because it metaphorically captures the main event of the story, where the lost documents, which ended up being thrown away as 'trash', are discovered and returned, becoming a 'treasure' due to their importance to Rashid, the husband. The narrative revolves around the unexpected journey of these essential papers, from being lost and turning up in a trash can, to being found and restored back into the hands of their rightful owner. Other titles, while relevant, do not encapsulate the story's plot as accurately or engagingly as this one. The concept of transforming \\"trash\\" into \\"treasure\\" furnishes a compelling metaphor for the story's central twist, thereby making it the most fitting title."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant. In the sleep laboratory Dr Koslov shows her a protocol about her dream in which she is pursued. She denies having dreamed anything, but sees her signature on the form.

Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? Dan is a geneticist and studied two villages from 2,000 years ago. Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... The answer is:","completion":"Village A didn't display an observable Allee effect. In the given paragraph, village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, suggesting a stable or expanding gene pool and healthy, thriving inhabitants. In contrast, village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically, which likely resulted in a loss of genetic diversity and an observable Allee effect due to genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and accumulation of deleterious mutations. The Allee effect is more likely to be observed in smaller, declining populations such as village B, whereas village A's larger, growing population would have faced fewer genetic challenges and thus did not display an observable Allee effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: new zealand sharemarket closes down Text:","completion":"Title: New Zealand Sharemarket Experiences a Downward Trend as it Closes Today The New Zealand sharemarket ended the day in negative territory as investors witnessed a decline in the overall performance of the market. While the country's economic conditions have shown some positive indicators, there have been numerous external factors contributing to the downturn experienced by the NZX. Mirroring the rocky behavior of various global markets, the New Zealand sharemarket saw several of its key stocks fall from their previous positions. Some investors are attributing this to the widening concerns about inflation, further compounded by the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This drop in the market could also be seen as an early sign of a weakening global economic recovery, which affects investor behavior and expectations. With the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in other parts of the world, a direct effect can be felt on New Zealand's supply chains and exports. This has continued to hamper the local industries' capacity to bounce back from the long-standing pandemic-induced restrictions. Moreover, the latest reports on inflation have alarmed investors who worry about how central banks, including New Zealand's Reserve Bank, might respond with policy changes to ensure economic stability. High global interest rates have also contributed to the falling market as investors tread cautiously while anticipating crucial market updates. Additionally, the contentious international political scene has played its part in swaying the sharemarket, creating a challenging situation for investors who are monitoring their investments closely. The NZX 50 Index, which represents the 50 largest New Zealand-listed companies, faced a significant drop in comparison to its previous trading day. Several major local players felt the brunt of the international economic ripple effect, as they saw their stock prices decline. Among these companies were prominent energy and transportation companies, telecommunications firms, and others from diverse sectors of the economy. However, despite the downward trend, some companies managed to buck the trend, delivering gains to their shareholders. They attributed their resilience in the market to robust earnings, improved business models, and innovation in products and services in response to the rapidly changing economic landscape. These entities, though fewer than the negatively impacted corporations, succeeded in offering a glimmer of hope for investors. Overall, as the New Zealand sharemarket closes down today, it is vital for investors to remain aware of the global economic forces shaping their investment decisions. Although some local factors contribute to the NZX's success or failure, the external elements often play a more significant role. Investors should be looking out for investment opportunities, but with proper risk assessment, to construct a robust and well-diversified portfolio. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining whether the decline is a temporary fluctuation or a harbinger of more substantial changes in the New Zealand sharemarket. Nevertheless, market watchers and investors will remain vigilant in examining market trends and the potential impact on their portfolios. It is important to note that while external forces may create fluctuations, the sharemarket still represents an opportunity for long-term investments to grow, given the right conditions and strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by Celtic tribesmen. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury. Living at his uncle's estate near Calleva (modern Silchester) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the Picts, accompanied only by his slave, Esca. The son of a deceased chieftain of the Brigantes, Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an amphitheatre show. After several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the Selgovae tribe.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where in America is known for theaters? Possible A: new york city, shopping mall, downtown area, skating rink, military base Why is \\"new york city\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"New York City\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when considering the question \\"Where in America is known for theaters?\\" for a multitude of reasons. First and foremost, New York City is globally renowned for its vibrant performing arts scene, including Broadway, which is one of the most prestigious and well-known theater districts in the world. Broadway is synonymous with professional theater and has a long, storied history of producing some of the most successful and influential theatrical performances ever. As such, New York City stands out as a focal point for theater enthusiasts from all over the world. Secondly, New York City is not only famous for Broadway but also for a thriving scene of Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway theaters. These non-Broadway venues showcase a rich variety of productions, ranging from experimental plays to long-running hits. The sheer diversity and creativity of these productions make New York City a unique destination for theatergoers. The overall cultural impact of theater in New York City is immense, therefore making it synonymous with theater in America. Moreover, the other possible answers provided do not align with the human common sense interpretation of the question as well as \\"New York City\\" does. A shopping mall, while it may have a small performing arts space, is primarily known for its retail stores and commerce. Downtown areas, although they might have local theaters, are not singularly known for their theater culture across America, and do not possess the same international recognition as New York City does. Skating rinks, on the other hand, are associated with ice-skating or roller-skating, which are recreational sports and not theater-related activities. Finally, military bases are known for housing military personnel and equipment; their primary function is not to support theatrical performances. Taking all these factors into account, it is evident that \\"New York City\\" is the answer that aligns most closely with human common sense in terms of the relationship between theater and a location in America. The city's remarkable theater scene, including Broadway, is a significant reason for this strong association and sets it apart from the other potential answers provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The driver of the train that derailed in northwestern Spain was charged Sunday with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. At least 79 people died as a result of last week's crash. A court granted the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, conditional release. His train driver's license was suspended for six months. He must report to court weekly, and his passport was surrendered. Earlier Sunday, the driver, who was hospitalized for two days while under police guard, was transferred to court, officials said. He was in court for more than five hours. The data recorders from the train are still with police. Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening. The crash on the outskirts of the city, which is popular with tourists and Christian pilgrims, shocked the Galician region and the rest of the nation. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters Saturday there are \\"rational indications\\" that the accident was the fault of the driver. Pressed on what those are, he declined to provide details. 5 questions on high-speed rail. Identifying the bodies. The crumpled wreckage of the eight cars sent careering onto their sides when the train derailed has been removed from the tracks, but the grim task of identifying the dead continues. Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN late Friday that 75 victims had been identified. At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said. Also among the fatalities are two U.S. citizens -- Ana-Maria Cordoba of Arlington, Virginia, and Myrta Fariza of Houston -- and some Europeans and Latin Americans. Fariza and her husband were on their way to celebrate a Catholic festival. He was injured and later released from the hospital. \\"Myrta was our loving wife, mother, sister, mother-in-law, aunt and friend, and words cannot express our sense of loss,\\" her family said in a statement. \\"To all who knew her, Myrta provided irreplaceable love, compassion, courage, friendship and support. We will miss her dearly.\\" As they are identified, most of the bodies are being returned to their families, the regional justice department said. DNA testing will be conducted on some remains to establish their identity, it said. Police forensic experts said at a news conference Saturday there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known. The death toll rose to at least 79 on Sunday morning when another person died, a representative for the regional health department said. About 70 people who were injured in the crash remained in the hospital Sunday, about 22 of them listed in serious condition, the official said. At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. Local newspaper La Voz de Galicia said that a funeral service for the victims will take place Monday evening in the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. Spain train crash victim: 'It felt like a roller coaster' Going too fast? Spanish news agency Efe and the national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (about 120 mph). Elena Garcia, a spokeswoman for national railway Renfe, did not disclose Friday the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can move as fast as 250 kph. But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the \\"tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,\\" but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when the crash occurred, the state railway said. Security footage revealed how, as the train hurtled around a bend, its cars derailed and slammed on their sides into a concrete support structure for a bridge. Opinion: Why high-speed rail is safe, smart. Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete. \\"When I saw the rail car flip into the air, I imagined something just horrible had happened,\\" she said. She and husband Suso tried to help the injured, taking bed sheets to wrap around the injured and ropes to haul the survivors off the tracks. Firefighter Miguel Angel Bello said the first four minutes after he arrived on the scene were a desperate race against time. He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames. A young girl in the wreckage called out to him. \\"She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home,\\" he said. \\"But she died.\\" Survivor: We looked like the walking dead. Stephen Ward of Bountiful, Utah, who is in Spain serving on a Mormon religious mission, was one of the lucky ones. Still patched up and wearing a neck brace, he told CNN's New Day show of his ordeal -- and his relief that he made it out alive and without permanent injury. Ward, 18, blacked out when his car slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. It took him a couple of minutes to grasp that what he was seeing outside was not a dream -- and that people were dead. \\"They were helping out other people -- there were bodies, there was screaming, there was smoke.\\" The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said. \\"I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood. They've scrubbed most of it off me now, but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least.\\" Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast. \\"But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,\\" he said, \\"And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me.\\" The derailment came on the eve of a public holiday to celebrate a saint's day, when more people than usual may have been traveling in the region.

A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth.

The date format in the first sentence is changed from \\"8 November 1969\\" to \\"November 8, 1969\\" in the second sentence. This change still keeps the same date, just in a different format. 2. The addition of a comma before \\"and was demolished in 1971\\" in the second sentence. This is not altering the meaning or information but only slightly improves the readability. Considering these changes do not significantly impact the meaning or information conveyed, the sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other. Answer: yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Q: When a rock is altered by heat from a nearby magma, what occurs? A: A:","completion":"When a rock is altered by heat from a nearby magma, a process called metamorphism occurs, specifically thermal or contact metamorphism. This is a geological phenomenon by which the rocks change their mineralogical composition, texture, structure, and physical properties as a result of exposure to high temperatures and, to a lesser degree, the introduction of chemically-active fluids released from the magma. The transformed rock is referred to as a metamorphic rock. There are several key aspects to understanding how rocks alter when exposed to heat from nearby magma: 1. Temperature: The temperature gradient around the magma determines how the original rock, known as protolith, will be affected. Magma temperature typically ranges from 700°C to 1300°C (1300°F to 2400°F), causing the surrounding rocks to heat up. Generally, the closer the rock is to the magma, the higher the temperature experienced, resulting in more profound metamorphism. 2. Minerals: Different minerals will respond distinctively to the heat from the nearby magma. For instance, when clay minerals heated, they alter into mica, and eventually garnet. Similarly, calcite from limestone or marble may react with silica to produce wollastonite. The specific combination of heat, pressure, and mineral chemistry dictates which new minerals will form during metamorphism. 3. Texture and structure: The texture and structure of rocks transform under heat from nearby magma. Firstly, crystal size tends to increase due to the process of recrystallization. This might result in the development of an interlocking mosaic of crystals consistent in size. Secondly, new textural arrangements may emerge as minerals become more thermodynamically stable during the alteration. Thirdly, foliated or banded textures might form in some instances due to the magmatic heat's reorientation of pre-existing minerals. 4. Dehydration and fluid activity: The heat may cause chemical changes in the minerals within the rock, leading to the release of water or other volatiles. These expelled fluids can result in further alteration of the rock, in a process known as metasomatism. This exchange of chemical components can facilitate the formation of new minerals or help transport metal ions, concentrating valuable elements and contributing to the formation of ore deposits. 5. Level of metamorphism: The level of metamorphism experienced by a rock depends on its temperature exposure and proximity to the magma. Lower levels of metamorphism can result in changes in mineralogy and texture without significantly affecting the protolith's structure. In contrast, higher levels of metamorphism may result in complete recrystallization and transformation of the rock into new metamorphic forms. In summary, when rock is altered by heat from nearby magma, it undergoes metamorphism. This process significantly changes its mineralogical composition, texture, structure, and physical properties. The key factors at play include the magma's temperature and its proximity, minerals within the rock, and hydration or dehydration of the rock. The degree of metamorphism determines the type and scale of alterations experienced by the affected rock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - In the United States, a department of motor vehicles (DMV) is a state-level government agency that administers vehicle registration and driver licensing. Similar departments exist in Canada. The name \\"DMV\\" is not used in every state or province, nor are the traditional DMV functions handled by a single agency in every state, but the generic term is universally understood, particularly in the context of driver's license issuance and renewal. - Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.

New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other motor vehicles as well as licensing drivers in the U.S. state of Vermont . - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa.

Sources do not agree on a precise number of deaths from the war because of a lack of body counts for confirmation. The number of Japanese Army dead in combat or died of wounds is put at around 59,000 with around 27,000 additional casualties from disease, and between 6,000 and 12,000 wounded. Estimates of Russian Army dead range from around 34,000 to around 53,000 men with a further 9,000 - 19,000 died of disease and around 75,000 captured. The total number of dead for both sides is generally stated as around 130,000 to 170,000. China suffered 20,000 civilian deaths, and financially the loss amounted to over 69 million taels' worth of silver. During many of the battles at sea, several thousand soldiers being transported drowned after their ships went down. There was no consensus about what to do with transported soldiers at sea, and as a result, many of the ships failed or refused to rescue soldiers that were left shipwrecked. This led to the creation of the second Geneva Convention in 1906, which gave protection and care for shipwrecked soldiers in armed conflict.

First question: \\"What does the apparition of the eight kings represent in 'Macbeth' by William Shakespeare?\\" Second question: What does the italic part try to express? I mean, what does it means by “10 times more common as a percentage of the population”? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer the first question, I will provide an explanation of the apparition of the eight kings in \\"Macbeth\\" by William Shakespeare. Step 1: Establish the context of the apparition In Act 4, Scene 1 of Macbeth, the protagonist Macbeth consults the three witches to seek knowledge about his future and that of his reign. Step 2: Describe the apparition of the eight kings During their consultation, the witches conjure a series of apparitions or visions to offer Macbeth insight into his future. The final apparition is a procession of eight kings, followed by the ghost of Banquo, who appears carrying a mirror. Step 3: Explain the symbolism of the apparition The apparition of the eight kings represents the future lineage of the Scottish monarchy, descending from Banquo's lineage, not Macbeth's. It is a foreshadowing of Macbeth's ultimate downfall and the end of his bloodline on the throne. As a prophecy, it undermines Macbeth's ambitions and forces him to confront the idea that his attempts to change fate are futile. This prophecy also serves to heighten Macbeth's paranoia and insecurity, further pushing him into tyranny and violence. Having answered the first question, I will now proceed to analyze the second question and provide an explanation for the italicized part. The italicized part from the user's input reads: \\"10 times more common as a percentage of the population.\\" Step 4: Explain the meaning of the italicized part This phrase means that a specific occurrence or characteristic is 10 times more likely or prevalent among a particular group or population, when compared to either a baseline population or another group. In other words, if something is stated as being \\"10 times more common as a percentage of the population,\\" it means that the rate at which that thing occurs or is present in a given community is tenfold compared to a different community or the overall population. Now, I will address the last part of the user's query. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking about the same thing. The first question pertains to the symbolism of a specific scene in a literary work, specifically William Shakespeare's \\"Macbeth,\\" while the second question seeks to clarify the meaning of a phrase related to statistical representation or prevalence within a population.

If \\"A baseball batter awaits a pitch.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A baseball batter is getting ready to hit the ball.\\"?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements in both statements. Statement 1: A baseball batter awaits a pitch. Statement 2: A baseball batter is getting ready to hit the ball. Step 2: Assess the relationship between the key elements. In both statements, the key element is the baseball batter. In Statement 1, the batter is awaiting a pitch, which means the batter is expecting the ball to be thrown towards them by the pitcher. In Statement 2, the batter is getting ready to hit the ball, implying that the batter is preparing to swing at the ball when it is pitched. Step 3: Evaluate the logical connection between the two statements. Since awaiting a pitch is an action that occurs prior to attempting to hit the ball, and getting ready to hit the ball implies preparing for the moment when the ball is pitched, there is a logical connection between the two statements. The batter must be ready to hit the ball as they await the pitch. Step 4: Determine whether the connection is strong enough to say that one statement logically follows the other.

Direct effect: Introducing excess stomach acid can potentially break down food more quickly, which could lead to an imbalance in the digestion process. It can also damage the stomach lining, causing discomfort or potentially leading to ulcers. Indirect effect: An imbalance in stomach acid levels can affect the way other digestive enzymes and fluids are released into the small intestine. This can impact the effectiveness of breaking down food into the smallest molecules for nutrient absorption.

Question: Information: - The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion. - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10 11 erg s 1 cm 2 ( 2.4x10 14 W m 2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E 1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness . - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, we can perform a step-by-step analysis to answer the given question. Step 1: Determine the preservation method used for each bowl of fruits. - Bowl A contains glacé fruits, which are preserved using the sugar syrup process. - Bowl B contains non-glace fruits, which are not preserved using this method. Step 2: Analyze the preservation effectiveness of glacé fruit. - The sugar syrup process used for glacé fruits involves drenching the fruit in syrup, which saturates the fruit with sugar and prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to unfavorable osmotic pressure. - This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. Step 3: Compare preservation effectiveness between Bowl A and Bowl B fruits. - Bowl A fruits are preserved using the sugar syrup process, which retains their quality for up to a year. - Bowl B contains non-glace fruits that are not preserved using this method. Therefore, they are more likely to spoil faster due to the lack of additional preservation techniques. Conclusion: Bowl A fruits, which are glacé fruits preserved with sugar syrup, would be preserved longer than the non-glace fruits in Bowl B."},{"prompt":"Q:When someone who is in good health dies suddenly ,there is usually an inquest .A coroner will do it.His job is to find out exactly how a person died.

Fact 2: All parasites are harmful to their host, but some are beneficial to humans. Given the two facts above, some what are beneficial to humans? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts above, some parasites are beneficial to humans. While it is true that all parasites are harmful to their host to some extent, there are instances where their presence can provide a positive effect on human health. One example of a beneficial parasite is the hookworm. In small numbers, hookworms can help regulate the human immune system, which reduces the risk of developing autoimmune and allergic diseases. Research has shown that in some cases, the presence of hookworms can alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Similarly, some parasitic worms that live in our intestines may offer protection against inflammatory diseases by causing a shift in our immune system from an overly inflammatory state to a more balanced one. Another example is the bacterium Wolbachia, a parasitic microorganism that infects a variety of insects. When these bacteria infect mosquitoes, they limit the spread of diseases like dengue fever, Zika virus, and yellow fever, making them beneficial for human health. In conclusion, although parasites generally have harmful effects on their hosts, there are certain cases where these organisms can provide some benefits to humans, typically through immune regulation or limiting the spread of other dangerous diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

South Africa v England: Graeme Swann five-wicket haul inspires second Test victory By Steve James in Durban Published: 9:01AM GMT 30 Dec 2009 Job done: Graeme Swann, with the ball in his pocket, enjoys the celebrations with centurions Alastair Cook and Ian Bell Photo: PA Five-for: Graham Swann spins England to victory in second Test Photo: AP England have hammered South Africa in the second Test in Durban. It took them little more than an hour to take the remaining four South African wickets to record a famous victory to put them 1-0 in this series, with two Tests to play. Graeme Swann took his fourth five-for in Test cricket and, fittingly, took the final wicket of Dale Steyn to lead England off the field and, presumably, into an early New Year party. The significance of the result cannot be underestimated. England's last innings victory over South Africa was 45 years ago on this very ground in 1964 when Kenny Barrington made 148 not out and Jim Parks 108 not out, and then Fred Titmus and David Allen spun them to victory. And it was only the sixth time South Africa have lost by an innings since their reintroduction to Test cricket. South Africa began the day on 76-6; England began with their two destroyers from the fourth day, Stuart Broad from the Umgeni End, Swann from the Old Fort End. A first wicket was not long in coming. Indeed, Morne Morkel did not last beyond the fifth ball of Swann's opening over, the second of the day, to continue Swann's remarkable record of striking immediately in a spell. Morkel should, in fact, have gone to the fourth ball, edging low to slip where Andrew Strauss, rather than the incapacitated Paul Collingwood, failed to take the chance to his right. The ball scuttled away to the boundary, but to the next ball the tall, left-handed Morkel fatally played back. He was struck on the back leg, plumb in front. South Africa did not have either of their permitted two reviews left, but, had they done so, such a request would have only used up time. There was no doubt about the decision. England did have a review remaining, however, and they soon put it to good use. Mark Boucher appeared to glove a short Broad delivery down the leg-side to wicketkeeper Matt Prior. England's appeal was huge and concerted. But umpire Amiesh Saheba did not concur. TV replays showed clearly that the ball had made contact with Boucher's gloves. Off he went for 29: 108-8. England now made a mess of a review. Swann struck Steyn on the pads from around the wicket. The appeal was confident, especially from Swann, but not confident enough for Strauss to make the required T-sign for a review. Replays showed that the ball pitched in line and would have hit the stumps comfortably. South Africa should have been nine down. Paul Harris was his usual obdurate and awkward self at the crease. Broad bombed him with bouncers but somehow he remained. He edged high between the two slips and two gullies and survived two half-chances, on 27 and 31, off Swann, the first wide of slip and the second a sharp chance at short mid-wicket. James Anderson replaced Broad and found instant success, with his fourth ball persuading Harris to chip to mid-on where Broad, unable to be kept out of the game, took the catch. He had made 36 from No 9, South Africa's top score of the innings, an embarrassing statistic for a much-vaunted top order. It was 129-9. It was soon 133 all out. Steyn played all around a turning Swann delivery and Aleem Dar had no hesitation in raising his finger to cue raucous celebrations. Swann finished with innings figures of 21-3-54-5 and quite brilliant match figures of 56-6-164-9. Broad also finished proudly with 17-3-43-4. It was a wonderfully comprehensive win, one of English cricket's great days. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Graeme Swann's five-wicket haul inspires England to victory in the second Test against South Africa in Durban, putting them 1-0 up in the series with two Tests remaining.

How is \\"I'm doing better than I thought.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I'm doing better than I thought\\" can be translated as \\"Mám se lépe, než jsem si myslel\\" (for a male speaker) or \\"Mám se lépe, než jsem si myslela\\" (for a female speaker). Here's a detailed breakdown of this translation: 1. \\"Mám se\\" - Translates to \\"I am\\" or \\"I'm doing\\" in English. It is derived from the verb \\"mít\\" which means \\"to have\\" and coupled with the reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" it forms a phrase that refers to the state of well-being. 2. \\"lépe\\" - This word means \\"better\\" and conveys an improvement in the speaker's current condition. It's the comparative form of the adverb \\"dobře\\" (well), and refers to doing something better than before or better than someone/something else. 3. \\"než\\" - This word translates to \\"than\\" and is the conjunction used for comparison in this context. 4. \\"jsem\\" - This is the conjugation of the auxiliary verb \\"být\\" (to be) in the first person singular (I am). It is used in combination with the past participle of action verbs to create past tense constructions. 5. \\"si myslel\\" or \\"si myslela\\" - This phrase is the past participle of the verb \\"myslet\\" (to think). The additional pronoun \\"si\\" emphasizes that the thought or thinking is personal and connected to the subject. The variation in the ending \\"myslel\\" (for a male speaker) or \\"myslela\\" (for a female speaker) reflects the gender agreement in Czech grammar.

Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\". - WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw (often shortened to WWE SvR or SVR 2005 and known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 6: SmackDown! vs. Raw in Japan), is a professional wrestling video game released on the PlayStation 2 console by THQ and developed by Yuke's.

Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used.

Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state. - WWE SmackDown !

The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief. - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

AFSOC was initially established on 10 February 1983 as Twenty - Third Air Force ( 23 AF ) , a subordinate numbered air force of the Military Airlift Command ( MAC ) , with 23 AF headquarters established at Hurlburt Field , Florida . On 22 May 1990 , 23 AF was redesignated as AFSOC and became a separate major command ( MAJCOM ) responsible for all USAF special operations forces ( SOF ) , aircraft and personnel in the Regular Air Force , Air Force Reserve , and the Air National Guard ( ANG ) . - Special forces and special operations forces are military or police units trained to conduct special operations. NATO defines special operations as \\"military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, manned with selected personnel, using unconventional tactics, techniques, and modes of employment\\". - Air Combat Command (ACC) is one of ten Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in the United States Air Force, reporting to Headquarters, United States Air Force (HAF) at the Pentagon. - Special operations (S.O.) are military operations that are \\"special\\" or unconventional and carried out by dedicated special forces and other special operations forces units using unconventional methods and resources. Special operations may be performed independently of or in conjunction with, conventional military operations. The primary goal is to achieve a political or military objective where a conventional force requirement does not exist or might adversely affect the overall strategic outcome. Special operations are usually conducted in a low-profile manner that aims to achieve the advantages of speed, surprise, and violence of action against an unsuspecting target. Special ops are typically carried out with limited numbers of highly trained personnel that are adaptable, self-reliant and able to operate in all environments, and able to use unconventional combat skills and equipment. Special operations are usually implemented through specific, tailored intelligence. - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare. - Hurlburt Field is a United States Air Force installation located in Okaloosa County, Florida, immediately west of the Town of Mary Esther.

Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released in mid 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Most accounts of recording Blonde on Blonde, including those by Dylan scholars Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14-17 and March 8-10, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records. Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March, and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian Sean Wilentz observed that \\"with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', Blonde on Blonde entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll\\". The same day saw the successful takes of \\"Just Like a Woman\\", and \\"Pledging My Time\\", the latter \\"driven by Robertson's screaming guitar\\". According to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9-10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine\\", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\". The session atmosphere began to \\"get giddy\\" around midnight when Dylan roughed out \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; \\"That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band\\". Dylan replied; \\"Can you get one?\\" Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song. In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded \\"Obviously 5 Believers\\" and a final take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" powered by Robertson's lead guitar. The session concluded with \\"I Want You\\" on which, as Wilentz notes, \\"Wayne Moss's rapid-fire sixteenth notes on the guitar\\" are an impressive element of the recording.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Scientists are closely concerned with the structure of buildings and with the quality of building materials. The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer. The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer. Options: A To determine whether the land is firm enough for a building to be sited on. B To make sure that the land contains no radioactive material. C To make certain that the land releases no formaldehyde or other gases. D To check whether it contains any combustible materials.

May attended Caerleon Endowed Junior School in Newport. He spent his teenage years in South Yorkshire where he attended Oakwood Comprehensive School in Rotherham and was a choirboy at Whiston Parish Church. He was also at school with Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes actor Dean Andrews. Context: May was a co-presenter of the original Top Gear series during 1999. He first co-presented the revived series of Top Gear in its second series in 2003, where he earned the nickname \\"Captain Slow\\" owing to his careful driving style. Despite this sobriquet, he has done some especially high-speed driving - in the 2007 series he took a Bugatti Veyron to its top speed of 253 mph (407 km/h), then in 2010 he achieved 259.11 mph (417 km/h) in the Veyron's newer 16.4 Super Sport edition. In an earlier episode he also tested the original version of the Bugatti Veyron against the Pagani Zonda F. May, along with co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson and an Icelandic support crew, travelled by car to the magnetic North Pole in 2007, using a modified Toyota Hilux. In the words of Clarkson, he was the first person to go there \\"who didn't want to be there\\". He also drove a modified Toyota Hilux up the side of the erupting volcano Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland. He has also driven a 1.3-litre Suzuki SJ413 through Bolivia, along Death Road, and over the Andes to the Pacific Ocean in Chile. In Season 22 Episode 7, he drove a rallycross Volkswagen Polo, with the assistance of the Top Gear USA presenter Tanner Foust, who also lapped him in the final 30 seconds of the semi-finals in the rallycross, entering James into the Guinness World Records as the first person to get lapped in rallycross. Following the BBC's decision not to renew Jeremy Clarkson's contract with the show on 25 March 2015, May stated in April 2015 that he would not continue to present Top Gear as part of a new line-up of presenters.

In this sentence, the main components are: - Subject: \\"It\\" - Verb: \\"was\\" - Noun: \\"taboo,\\" \\"20 feet\\" - Preposition: \\"for\\" - Possessive pronoun: \\"us\\" - Pronoun: \\"to say\\" Step 2: Understand the meaning and context of the sentence. The sentence expresses that mentioning \\"20 feet\\" was considered a taboo for a group of people, so they were not supposed to say it. Step 3: Translate each component into Czech. - Subject: It = to - Verb: was = bylo - Noun: taboo = tabu, 20 feet = 20 stop - Preposition: for = pro - Possessive pronoun: us = nás - Pronoun: to say = říct Step 4: Arrange the Czech components into a coherent sentence.

Given the following context: Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.

The information provided shows that there is a recurrent scenario where the man arrives from work and finds someone else, likely his significant other or a close person, engrossed in soap opera viewing. Repeatedly finding himself in this situation has led to his repulsion for soap operas. However, while the hypothesis is drawn accurately from the premise, it is important to note that the explicit reason behind his distaste for soap operas isn't given in the premise. There isn't a clear causal link mentioned outright between his weariness with soap operas and finding her watching soap operas when he gets home from work. It's possible that he might just not like the content of soap operas itself or may simply be unhappy because the television is occupied when he returns from work, and he can't watch what he likes. But, as the hypothesis was made based on the straightforward viewpoint of the situation, it is indeed the most likely and sensible conclusion. Nonetheless, being a hypothesis means it is a proposed explanation and not undeniably a fact. The context of a situation and other unexpressed underlying feelings and thoughts could potentially offer alternative explanations. Furthermore, the extent to which he is \\"sick\\" of soap operas, whether it's a mild irritation or a serious frustration, is also not defined in the premise. Moreover, the timeline mentioned in the premise - about four years - likely suggests a chronic and sustained exposure to the situation, amplifying his sentiment of being \\"so sick.\\" Such a long period of a person consistently doing the same thing could indeed lead to feelings of discontentment, dissatisfaction, or in his case, being sick of soap operas.

Understanding the sentiment of a text often requires knowledge on natural language processing and understanding the subtleties of human language. Analyzing the given tweet: \\"Luckyyy. I only have one more week of school, but then i only get 2 weeks off I want longerrr!\\" we can divide it into two parts to understand the underlying sentiment. In the first half of the tweet, \\"Luckyyy. I only have one more week of school...\\", the user expresses a sense of cheerfulness and relief. This is conveyed especially through the word \\"Lucky\\", followed by the contentment towards having only one more week of school. This signifies a positive sentiment as it implies the user is looking forward to the conclusion of school, which likely represents the end of a stressful period for them. However, in the second half of the tweet, \\"... but then i only get 2 weeks off I want longerrr!\\", the sentiment shifts to a rather negative or discontent one. The user clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the duration of their break, indicating they yearn for a longer time off. The multiple usage of the letter 'r' in \\"longerrr\\" additionally amplifies the degree of dissatisfaction. Hence, this tweet contains mixed sentiment. It starts with a positive sentiment – happiness and relief towards the end of school, but then shifts to a negative sentiment, due to discontentment with the length of the scheduled break.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE DINNER AT BICKERSTAFF'S--HIFFERNAN AND HIS IMPECUNIOSITY--KENRICK'S EPIGRAM--JOHNSON'S CONSOLATION--GOLDSMITH'S TOILET--THE BLOOM-COLORED COAT--NEW ACQUAINTANCES--THE HORNECKS--A TOUCH OF POETRY AND PASSION--THE JESSAMY BRIDE In October Goldsmith returned to town and resumed his usual haunts. We hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author of Love in a Village, Lionel and Clarissa, and other successful dramatic pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman; somewhat idle and intemperate; who lived nobody knew how nor where, sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who was ever the vagabond's friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the dignity of a disease, which he termed _impecuniosity_, and against which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce had the author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but continued to read in a more elevated tone. The louder he read, the louder Hiffernan snored; until the author came to a pause. \\"Never mind the brute, Bick, but go on,\\" cried Goldsmith. \\"He would have served Homer just so if he were here and reading his own works.\\" 1.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) Review: From the moment I installed \\"Pixel Dungeon\\" (com.watabou.pixeldungeon), I knew that I was in for an unforgettable gaming experience. The game is an exceptional combination of engaging gameplay, inventive storytelling and polished visuals. Right off the bat, the game’s simplicity speaks volumes; it is easy to use, with an intuitive user interface that is easily navigable. But don't let the simplicity fool you, because underneath it hides layers of complex, challenging, and exciting gameplay. Every turn, every move requires strategic thinking, making it not only a game but a mental exercise as well. Pixel Dungeon stands out in the oversaturated market of dungeon crawler games, demonstrating a level of depth and complexity that is refreshing. The enemies are diverse and well-thought-out, each presenting their own unique challenge. The character progression system is comprehensive and enjoyable, allowing for some in-depth character building. Despite the high-level complexity, the game runs buttery smooth on my device, without any noticeable lagging or freezing issues. It is apparent that a lot of work has gone into optimizing the game for multiple devices. The app updates have also been consistent and substantial, bringing new features and fixing any minor hitches that pop up. Additionally, one of my favorite aspects of Pixel Dungeon is the pixel art design. This aesthetic brings a sense of nostalgia and adds to the game's overall charm. It’s remarkable how such simple graphics can present a wide variety of dungeons, items, and enemies so clearly and creatively. The developers of com.watabou.pixeldungeon have done a phenomenal job of crafting an immersive, challenging, and fun experience with their application. I commend them on their attention to detail and their commitment to maintaining an engaging game environment.

In this sentence, the speaker is indicating that they will be stopping for a duration of 30 to 45 minutes and will be having a meal on board the vehicle or vessel they are traveling in. This statement suggests that this sort of stop has taken place before as it uses the term \\"once again\\" or in the original German, \\"ein weiteres Mal.\\" It could be a regular occurrence during their travel or something they have done multiple times earlier on their journey. The phrase \\"30 bis 45 Minuten\\" signifies the range of time they expect their break to last. In English, the words \\"to\\" or \\"through\\" typically represent this range, so the phrase can be translated to \\"30 to 45 minutes.\\" Next, the terms \\"essen\\" and \\"an Bord\\" refer to eating and being on board, respectively. These words can be combined with the other components of the sentence to convey the intended meaning. When translated literally, the German text states \\"we are eating on board,\\" which can be smoothly incorporated into the English sentence. It is also important to mention that the context of this sentence may vary. They could be on a road trip and making a stop at a rest area, on a train that has designated times for eating meals, or aboard a boat or ship where they have scheduled breaks to dine. The mode of transportation or typeof journey is not explicitly defined in this sentence and can be inferred based on the broader context provided in the conversation. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Wir halten ein weiteres Mal 30 bis 45 Minuten und essen an Bord\\" can be translated as \\"Once again, we are stopping for 30 to 45 minutes and eating on board\\" in English. Thus, the original message communicates that the speaker and their companions will be stopping for a break lasting between half an hour to three-quarters of an hour and having a meal on their vessel or vehicle before continuing on their journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose more steam is produced happens, how will it affect MORE snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: more Justification: The query investigates what would happen if more steam is produced. Steam is essentially water vapor, and as the process mentions, water is a critical component of snow formation. 1. More Steam Production: If additional steam is produced, this implies that there's an increase in the quantity of water vapor in the air. 2. More Water Vapor: Given that water vapor is necessary for the formation of snow, more of it would enhance the chances for snow production. 3. Increased Ice Crystal Formation: As stated by the process, the initial stage in snow formation is when the water in the air forms tiny ice crystals. So, with additional water vapor (from the extra steam), one should expect an increase in ice crystal formation. 4. The Snowfall Process Continues: Once ice crystals are created, they carry on colliding and sticking with each other, growing in size, becoming heavy, and eventually transforming into snowflakes which fall to the ground as snow. In conclusion, the creation of more steam, leading to more water vapor in the air, should logically result in increased snowfall, presuming other crucial conditions for snow formation are also met (like the air being cold).

Migration, as the question states, is when animals move themselves from a cooler climate to a warmer climate for the winter. The primary purpose of migration in birds, such as geese, is to find suitable habitats where the availability of resources like food, nesting sites, and safety from predators is abundant. This behavior helps them avoid the harsh conditions of the colder regions, such as heavy snowfall, severe cold, and scarcity of food, that might impact their survival and reproduction. Thus, when geese migrate during late summer or early autumn, their primary goal is to find warmer areas that have a less severe winter climate, thereby essentially leading them to less snowy areas. Other options mentioned in the choices do not specifically address the primary objective of migration as based on the provided evidence. While geese might occasionally visit Florida (b), this choice cannot be generalized as birds might opt for other warmer regions depending on their specific range and distribution. Therefore, this option is not the most accurate answer. Taking a scenic route (c) rarely comes into play when determining the migratory paths of birds. Geese choose their migration routes based on factors like safety, energy conservation, and finding the most efficient paths. Although they might pass through scenic areas, it is not the primary driver behind their directional choices. Lastly, the migration patterns and group-style of geese (d) are not necessarily a direct result of moving from cooler to warmer climates. While it's true that geese often travel in groups called flocks or skeins, this behavior is more closely linked to their social structure and safety concerns rather than whether they're in search of a warmer climate or less snowy areas specifically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: President Obama departed from the draft of his speech far more than usual on Wednesday during an address on energy policy at Georgetown University. But the ad lib that got the biggest rise from students came when he gave a nod to his energy secretary, the Nobel laureate Steven Chu. “He actually deserved his Nobel Prize,” Mr. Obama quipped. The president’s joke, as the laughing students clearly knew, was on himself. In a month in which Mr. Obama has sent American forces to a third war zone, Libya, the seeming incongruity of his having won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 – less than nine months into his presidency – has been a matter of some discussion once again. As for Mr. Chu, he shared the 1997 prize for physics with two other scientists for their work using laser light to cool and trap atoms. The Nobel committee said the scientists’ advances had enabled closer study of atoms, which could lead to the development of more precise atomic clocks – for use in space navigation, for example – and to the manufacture of diminutive electronic components. Mr. Obama, in naming Mr. Chu as energy secretary, praised him as a leader in the search for alternative and renewable energy sources to arrest climate change; then and on several occasions since, he has cited Mr. Chu’s Nobel Prize. Mr. Obama won his Nobel for what the committee called his “vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.” But coming in October of his first year as president, the announcement shocked Mr. Obama and his top advisers, who foresaw that the award would be widely seen both as premature for a new president and as incongruous with his role as commander in chief of a nation withdrawing from one war, in Iraq, and ramping up another, in Afghanistan. Last week in El Salvador, with news of the allied assault in Libya against the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi stealing attention from Mr. Obama’s five-day visit to Latin America, the president was asked by CNN En Espanol to square his war-making with his peace prize. Mr. Obama acknowledged the apparent irony, as he had in his Nobel acceptance speech in regard to Iraq and Afghanistan. “I’m accustomed to this contradiction, of being both a commander in chief but also somebody who aspires to peace,” he said. In the case of Libya, Mr. Obama noted that the military action was a multinational effort sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. “And,” he said, “I think the American people don’t see any contradiction in somebody who cares about peace also wanting to make sure that people aren’t butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power.” ||||| President Obama gave a speech on energy today, but the most interesting part of the presentation was how much fun Obama had entertaining himself. In addition to laughing for a few seconds at one of his jokes, Obama even sarcastically hinted that he might not have deserved the Nobel Peace Prize he received. Obama praised the intelligence and skills of his Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, and mentioned that “Chu’s the right guy to do this, he’s got a Nobel prize in physics — he actually deserved his Nobel prize.” The audience exploded with laughter. Obama then went on to describe Chu as someone who likes to spend his free time on weekends in the garage figuring out how to extract natural gas. After picturing that image, Obama too couldn’t contain his laughter. Obama’s ability to engage in self-deprecating humor is likely to endear him to many, however, his fiercest critics might have a predictable, although still humorous, response of their own: “finally Obama speaks the truth.” Watch the clip below from today’s speech: Please enable Javascript to watch.

Write a text based on \\"rocket bomb threats to u.s. troops in eastern afghanistan\\" Text:","completion":"Rocket Bomb Threats to U.S. Troops in Eastern Afghanistan In Eastern Afghanistan, a rising unease has swept through the ranks of U.S. troops, as a series of rocket bomb threats loom large. The region, already beleaguered by years of pervasive conflict between insurgent groups and Afghan security forces, has become an even more precarious, volatile ground due to these new terror risks. The increased threats are reportedly the handiwork of insurgent groups and terrorist networks operating within the country, particularly the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the local Islamic State affiliate, ISIS-K. Along with these insurgents, there are also unverified reports of clandestine malign forces underpinning the destabilizing efforts to realize deeper geopolitical consequences. Rocket bombs, as a weapon of choice, bear the potential capacity to cause extensive damage. The choice of this high-impact explosive weapon indicates a severely escalated terror threat level, underlining the tactical sophistication and upgraded capacities of these insurgent groups. The U.S. troops stationed in the eastern regions near the porous Afghan-Pakistan border have been the primary focus of these threats. The frontline troops, which work closely with Afghan security forces and also shoulder the massive responsibility of training the local forces, are highly vulnerable to these attacks. The life and work of military personnel, under these threatening circumstances, are fraught with uncertainty and danger. Besides the obvious physical threat, the rocket bomb risks also carry significant strategic implications for U.S. interests in the region and otherwise. Approximately, 2,500 U.S. service members remain in Afghanistan, their presence a vital cog in the complex machinery that's striving to guarantee peace and security in the country. If the threats escalate into actual attacks, a considerable portion of the U.S. force could be at stake, Moreover, this security ordeal traps the United States in a diplomatic and policy-making quandary. The Pentagon has to reevaluate their troop withdrawal strategy set forth earlier. Concentrated withdrawals or significant reductions in this volatile situation could invite further instability. Additionally, these rocket bomb threats embody a significant test for the Afghan government and security infrastructure. They are now grappling with the formidable task of countering these terrorist activities while upholding the elongated peace efforts. Finally, these threats would feasibly echo concern across NATO partners and countries hosting boots on Afghan soil alike. The U.S., along with its partners, has been particularly insistent on supporting the fledgling Afghan democracy against any assault that these insurgent groups may mount. Nevertheless, any impending attacks might serve as catalysts for geopolitical destabilization across the region. In conclusion, the rocket bomb threats against U.S. troops in Eastern Afghanistan signal an alarming surge in the level of violence and instability in the region. The situation obliges a stern reaction from the global community and principled solidarity in the face of terror. Only time will tell how these threats will translate on the ground and shape up future U.S. strategies and policies in Afghanistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mepham High School. His parents divorced when he was five years old (the documentary Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth claims he was eight years old), and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. Context: On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity at the Jazz Workshop in San Francisco; he had used the word cocksucker and riffed that \\"to is a preposition, come is a verb\\", that the sexual context of come is so common that it bears no weight, and that if someone hearing it becomes upset, he \\"probably can't come\\". Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under charges of obscenity. Bruce was arrested again in 1961, in Philadelphia, for drug possession and again in Los Angeles, two years later. The Los Angeles arrest took place in then-unincorporated West Hollywood, and the arresting officer was a young deputy named Sherman Block, who later became County Sheriff. The specification this time was that the comedian had used the word schmuck, an insulting Yiddish term that is an obscene term for penis. The Hollywood charges were later dismissed. On December 5, 1962, Bruce was arrested on stage at the legendary Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago. The same year he played at Peter Cook's The Establishment club in London, and in April the next year he was barred from entering England by the Home Office as an \\"undesirable alien\\". In April 1964, he appeared twice at the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village, with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with the club owners, Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance to take place. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities. A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant D.A. Richard Kuh, with Ephraim London and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon were both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from - among other artists, writers and educators - Woody Allen, Bob Dylan, Jules Feiffer, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, William Styron, and James Baldwin, and Manhattan journalist and television personality Dorothy Kilgallen and sociologist Herbert Gans. Bruce was sentenced on December 21, 1964 to four months in a workhouse; he was set free on bail during the appeals process and died before the appeal was decided. Solomon later saw his conviction overturned; Bruce, who died before the decision, never had his conviction stricken. Bruce later received a full posthumous gubernatorial pardon. Question: Any other words that were considered to be \\"obscene\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are numerous other words that have been considered \\"obscene\\" throughout history, and many that are still regarded as such today. Obscenity standards have evolved over time, shaped by social, cultural, and legal contexts. Here are some examples of words and phrases that have been considered obscene at various times: 1. The \\"seven dirty words\\": In the 1970s, comedian George Carlin listed the \\"seven words you can never say on television\\" in a routine that became well-known and controversial. These words were considered to be highly obscene during that time and included: shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. 2. Sexual slang and profanity: Words and phrases related to sexual acts and body parts have often been deemed obscene, including terms such as sodomy, buggery, fellatio, cunnilingus, masturbation, penis, vagina, and anus. The use of these words has historically led to censorship, as well as legal repercussions. 3. Racial slurs and derogatory terms: Words meant to insult and demean people based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality have been considered obscene and offensive. Examples of these words include the \\"N-word\\" and various slurs targeting other racial and ethnic groups. 4. Religious profanities: Taking the name of a deity or religious figure in vain, as well as using religious terms to curse or insult, have been considered obscene. This includes phrases such as \\"goddamn\\" or \\"Jesus Christ\\" when used in a derogatory manner. 5. Scatological language: Swear words related to excrement, urine, and other bodily functions have been deemed obscene, such as \\"shit,\\" \\"piss,\\" and \\"crap.\\" 6. Vulgar slang and colloquialisms: Some words and phrases that are considered informal, crude, or offensive may be regarded as obscene, depending on the context and the audience. This might include terms like \\"ass,\\" \\"bastard,\\" \\"bitch,\\" and \\"son of a bitch.\\" 7. Obscenities in other languages: Different languages have their own sets of obscene words and phrases, shaped by each culture's unique historical, social, and religious contexts. For example, Spanish has various curse words that are considered taboo, such as \\"joder,\\" \\"coño,\\" and \\"cabrón.\\" Over the years, societies and legal systems have had varying standards of obscenity, and what might have been considered obscene in the past may not be seen as such today. Similarly, what is deemed obscene in one culture might not be regarded as offensive in another, highlighting the subjectivity of obscenity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the person who met Busoni in Leipzig? from the following article ? While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate...

Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch.

An investigation into the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, initially scheduled for completion this month, is only likely to be finished in September, FIFA said in a statement on Monday. 'We expect to deliver our report to the adjudicatory chamber by the first week of September 2014,' said a statement issued by FIFA on behalf of its ethics committee. Former United States attorney Michael Garcia has been leading an internal probe by FIFA's ethics committee into allegations of corruption in the run-up to the vote in December 2010, which awarded the tournament to the Gulf state. Under scrutiny: FIFA investigator Michael Garcia has delayed the announcing of his report until September. No association: The Qatar 2022 World Cup committee bid denies that Mohamed Bin Hamman was associated with the bid process for hosting the World Cup. Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup. Garcia, who began his investigation 18 months ago, had said in June that he expected to deliver his report by the end of this month. When complete, Garcia's report will be handed to German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the ethics committee's adjudicatory chamber, and if he finds corruption, Qatar could face a challenge to its position as host either through a re-vote or other processes. Shortly before the World Cup in Brazil, The Sunday Times reported that some of the 'millions of documents' it had seen linked payments by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam to officials to win backing for Qatar's World Cup bid.

She then put down the toilet lid and conducted the experiment again, and the potato bounced harmlessly off the lid. That's because (A) the saran wrap is thinner (B) the toilet lid is thinner","completion":"The answer your students should choose in this logic test is (A) the saran wrap is thinner. This logic test presents a situation involving an experiment conducted by Sue. In the experiment, she covers the toilet bowl with saran wrap and drops a potato on it. The potato falls straight through the saran wrap. She then repeats the experiment with the toilet lid in place of the saran wrap, and the potato bounces harmlessly off the lid. These observations are designed to test the students' ability to understand the relationship between the thickness of a material and its ability to resist deformation and withstand force. When Sue places the saran wrap on the toilet bowl, its thin and flexible nature allows for the potato to break through it easily. This suggests that the saran wrap does not provide much resistance against the force exerted by the potato upon impact. It is unable to hold the weight of the potato, and thus, the potato falls straight through. On the other hand, when Sue places the toilet lid down and repeats the experiment, the potato bounces harmlessly off the lid. This indicates that the toilet lid is more robust and resistant to the force exerted by the falling potato. The toilet lid is able to successfully hold the weight of the potato, keeping it from falling into the toilet bowl. This suggests that the toilet lid is thicker or more rigid than the saran wrap, providing greater resistance and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the saran wrap is thinner, as it offers less resistance to the force applied by the potato and fails to hold its weight. In comparison, the toilet lid is thicker and sturdier, effectively handling the force exerted by the potato and preventing it from falling through."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group made a fire from smaller particles? Two groups of teens studied fire for the physics class. Group S made a fire using large logs, while group F made a fire using small twigs and sawdust. Both groups used the same volume of wood. Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. A:","completion":"From the paragraph, we can deduce the following steps: 1. Identify the group that used smaller particles. 2. Relate smaller particles to greater surface area. 3. Understand the relationship between greater surface area and quicker reactions. Step 1: The paragraph mentions that group S made a fire using large logs, while group F made a fire using small twigs and sawdust. Step 2: Since group F used small twigs and sawdust, they were using smaller particles, which leads to greater surface area. Step 3: An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction, meaning the group with the smaller particles would have a more quickly burning fire. Based on the information provided and the steps taken to understand the scenario, the answer to the question is: Group F made a fire from smaller particles."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The Doors Movie plot: California, 1968. In a dark recording studio, Jim Morrison, lead singer for the rock band, The Doors, drinks whiskey while recording spoken-word versions of his poetry. The engineer (a cameo appearance by Doors drummer, John Densmore) plays a pre-recorded music track and Jim begins to recite his work \\"An American Prayer\\".In a flashback to 1949, a young Jim and his family are seen driving across the Southwestern United States in New Mexico. They pass the scene of a car accident involving two families; one family are American Indians. An old Indian man lies dying on the side of the road. Jim watches until his family has driven out of sight.The film then jumps to 1965. Jim is seen hitchhiking to California and is picked up by a motorist. In Los Angeles Jim attends UCLA's film school. His student film, an artistic and surreal collection of haunting images, is heavily criticized by both his classmates and his professor (a cameo by director Oliver Stone). His future band mate, Ray Manzarek, tells Jim that his movie is commendable, despite the criticism. When the professor asks Jim to defend the film, Jim says simply \\"I quit.\\"Jim takes up residence in Venice Beach and meets Pamela Courson, his future wife. The two spend a romantic evening on a rooftop and they have sex. Jim later meets Manzarek on the beach, interrupting him while he meditates. Jim shows Ray poetry he has written that he believes can be recorded as a song (\\"Moonlight Drive\\"). Ray is astounded and the two set out to form a band, the name being inspired by Aldous Huxley's memoirs, The Doors of Perception. They recruit John Densmore as their drummer and Robby Krieger on guitar. Their first rehearsals are held in Ray's apartment, where they perform \\"Break on Through\\". Robby plays a song he'd been working on which becomes \\"Light My Fire\\". The band finds themselves on LA's famous Sunset Strip, performing as an opening act in one of the Strip's many clubs. The band is approached by a talent agent who wants to sign them. The same man later tries to talk to...

Ahondando más en esto, podemos enfocarnos en varios aspectos: En primer lugar, la democracia es una piedra angular de este sistema que se está creando. Implica la participación activa de todos los miembros del sistema internacional, donde todas las voces se escuchan y se toman en cuenta en la toma de decisiones. No sólo se trata de garantizar que las naciones y sus ciudadanos tengan una voz, sino también garantizar la transparencia en todos los procesos, que son elementos cruciales en un sistema democrático. En segundo lugar, la igualdad de oportunidades es vital en este sistema. Esto significa que todas las naciones y culturas deben tener las mismas oportunidades para intercambiar y apreciar los beneficios económicos, culturales y sociales. También implica que debemos tratar de rectificar los desequilibrios existentes en el reparto de los beneficios del comercio y las relaciones culturales. Debe haber esfuerzos conscientes para asegurar que la riqueza y los beneficios se distribuyan de manera equitativa para poder alcanzar un mundo más justo y equitativo. Respetar las diferencias es otra faceta esencial de este enfoque. Cada nación, cada cultura tiene su propia manera única y valiosa de ver y entender el mundo, sus propias tradiciones y maneras de vida. Esto debe ser apreciado y respetado en lugar de ser ignorado o subestimado. Sólo de esta manera se puede fomentar una verdadera comprensión y respeto entre diferentes naciones y culturas. Además, el diálogo total entre culturas es crucial para el éxito de este sistema. Esto significa que debe haber un intercambio de ideas y experiencias abiertas y sinceras entre diferentes culturas y países. Es a través de tal intercambio y diálogo que podemos aprender unos de otros, superar malentendidos y trabajar juntos para alcanzar objetivos comunes. Finalmente, todo esto debe ser guiado por la consolidación y promoción de una cultura de paz. Esto implica fomentar actitudes y comportamientos que favorezcan la paz y la armonía, la no-violencia y la cooperación en lugar de conflictos. Esto se traduce en el respeto de los derechos humanos, la resolución pacífica de conflictos, y el promover una cooperación global en temas como el cambio climático, la pobreza y las desigualdades sociales. Por lo tanto, este sistema de intercambio económico y cultural internacional que estamos buscando debe ser uno que respete y promueva principios democráticos, la igualdad de oportunidades, el respeto de las diferencias, el diálogo continuo entre culturas y la consolidación de una cultura de paz.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... I am facing a new situation today: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which would be lighter, item A or item B? A:","completion":"Item A (the Earth) would be heavier than item B (the surface rock sample).

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A large rocky area is formed - The rocky area has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas - Water from precipitation falls in the area - The water forms a stream - The stream flows towards lower elevation - The stream becomes a river - The river continues to flow along the same path for a long time - The river erodes the rocky area that it touches Answer:","completion":"The final step of this process is the formation of a river valley or canyon due to the long-term erosion and the transportation of sediments caused by the river's continuous flow. In the beginning, a large rocky area is formed, which has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas. This elevated area serves as the headwaters for the river system. When water from precipitation falls in the area, it accumulates and forms a stream, which flows towards lower elevation areas. As the stream collects more water, it turns into a river. Over time, the river continuously flows along the same path sculpting the landscape around it. The river's fast-moving water erodes the rocky areas that it touches by breaking down the rocks into smaller pieces. This process is known as erosion, and it can happen through various mechanisms such as abrasion, attrition (collision of sediment particles), and hydraulic action (pressure exerted by the water on the rocks). As the rocks and sediments break down, the river transports them downstream, further shaping the landscape. Simultaneously, the gradient of the river (the rate of change in elevation) decreases as the river flows towards lower elevations. The river's flow can also be influenced by various factors such as the underlying geology, tectonic activity, and climatic conditions. The continual erosion and transportation of sediments by the river eventually lead to the formation of a river valley, where the river flows between steep, eroded walls. Over time, this widening and deepening process can potentially create a canyon. A famous example of this process is the Grand Canyon, formed by the Colorado River over millions of years. In conclusion, the final step in this process is the formation of a river valley or canyon as a result of the river's dynamic force of erosion and transportation of sediments over an extended period. The shape and extent of the river valley or canyon are determined by the interplay of numerous factors such as the initial landscape, geology, climatic conditions, and tectonic forces acting on the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A celebrated descent from antiquity (the Bagratid \\"line\\") begins with Arsaces. Arsaces or Ashk has also given name to the city of Ashkabad. - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - Mithridates III of Parthia ( Persian : ) ruled the Parthian Empire c. 57 -- 54 BC. Mithridates was a son of Phraates III , whom he murdered in 57 BC , with the assistance of his brother Orodes .

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising.

To do this, first move the constant term (990) to the other side of the equation by subtracting 990 from both sides: 0 - 990 = 198*w + 990 - 990 This simplifies to: -990 = 198*w Step 3: Solve for w.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. After reading the above, is \\"1517\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many AmerIndians were said to be living in the land of \\"land of wood and water\\" by the time Columbus arrived?\\"?

Would \\"Piper PA-25 Pawnee , agricultural aircraft\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: A. No. B. Yes.","completion":"A. No. The arrival of the horse affected the Pawnee Indians in significant ways, but the \\"Piper PA-25 Pawnee, agricultural aircraft\\" is not a reasonable answer to this question. The Piper PA-25 Pawnee is named after the Pawnee tribe, but it is an aircraft used for agricultural purposes and not related to the historical impact of horses on the Pawnee Indians. The introduction of the horse to the Pawnee Indians transformed their way of life in various aspects: 1. Mobility and hunting: Before the arrival of the horse, the Pawnee people primarily relied on dogs as their means of transportation. With horses, they were able to cover much greater distances and hunt large game like bison with increased efficiency. The horse allowed them to become more nomadic, expanding their territory and resources. 2.Power balance: The tribes who acquired horses first gained an advantage against others in battles and raids. Horses increased the military capabilities of the Pawnee, which ultimately affected power dynamics among rival tribes. 3.Social structure: Horses were considered valuable assets, so having a significant number of horses increased an individual's or family's social standing within the community. 4.Trade and Economy: Horses facilitated long-distance trade. This enhanced the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies among different tribes and ultimately contributed to the cultural development of the Great Plains tribes, including the Pawnee. 5.Culture: The Pawnee incorporated horses into their ceremonies, spirituality, and artistic expressions, which expanded their cultural landscape. Horses became a defining aspect of their identity and daily life. In summary, the arrival of the horse had a profound impact on the Pawnee Indians and their society. It improved their mobility and economic opportunities, changed their social structure, affected their power relations, and transformed their culture. The Piper PA-25 Pawnee agricultural aircraft is unrelated to these historical changes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

What is the answer?","completion":"Succotash is a traditional Native American dish that primarily consists of corn (maize) and beans. The beans used in this dish are typically lima beans. The word \\"succotash\\" is derived from the Narragansett word \\"msíckquatash,\\" which means \\"boiled corn kernels.\\" This hearty dish has its origins in the northeastern United States, particularly in the regions inhabited by the Native American tribes, and it gained widespread popularity during the colonial era. The combination of corn and lima beans provides a well-rounded source of nutrients, as maize is rich in carbohydrates and some vitamins, while lima beans are an excellent source of protein, fibers, and minerals. Additionally, some variations of succotash may also include other ingredients, such as tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and garlic, which provide an extra burst of flavor and nutrients. To make succotash, follow this recipe: Ingredients: - 2 cups of fresh or frozen corn kernels - 2 cups of fresh or frozen lima beans - 1 medium onion, diced - 1 red bell pepper, diced - 2 cloves of garlic, minced - 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil - 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable broth - Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste - Optional: cherry tomatoes, cut in half, and chopped fresh herbs such as parsley or cilantro for garnish Instructions: 1. In a large skillet or saucepan, heat butter or olive oil over medium heat. 2. Add the diced onion and cook for about 5-7 minutes until softened and translucent. 3. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Make sure to stir constantly to avoid burning the garlic. 4. Stir in the diced red bell pepper and cook for another 3-4 minutes. 5. Add the corn kernels and lima beans to the skillet, mixing them well with the other ingredients. 6. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and simmer the mixture for about 10-15 minutes until the beans are cooked through. If using fresh corn and lima beans, the cooking time may be a bit longer. If you'd like a more tender dish, you can let it cook longer as well. 7. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper according to your taste. 8. Optional: for additional flavor and color, add the cherry tomatoes and chopped fresh herbs during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. Mix them well with the succotash. 9. Serve the succotash as a side dish or incorporate it into other recipes such as casseroles, salads, or stuffed peppers. Succotash is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed during different seasons and in various ways. The combination of corn and lima beans, along with the other flavorful ingredients, creates a delicious and nutritious dish that showcases the culinary heritage of Native American cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: More and more birds are flying to settle at Qinghai Lake, one of the highest inland lakes in China, thanks to the protection efforts of local governments. Covering an area of over 4,000 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is also the country's biggest salt-water lake. Located in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, the lake is famous for the two islands at its northwest point--Cormorant Island and Egg Island. The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake. To protect this paradise for birds and support calls for ecological protection, China set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone at the end of 1997. Meanwhile, the State has pointed out the Bird Islands and Spring Bay of the Qinghai Lake as central protection zones. Inspection officials and management employees often patrol the lake, improving local residents' knowledge of related laws and spreading knowledge about animal protection to visitors. They are making great efforts to call on people to love and protect the birds. At the same time, they have built special fences around the island area, to prevent wolves, foxes and other carnivorous animals, as well as illegal hunters from breaking up the birds' nest-building, egg-laying and breeding. As a result, more and more birds are coming to the islands for sheltering and breeding. Why are more and more birds coming to the biggest salt-water lake in the Great Northwest?

Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience? from the following article ? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

Bring in the bottom line In 2011, Dell executive Aongus Hegarty was looking to build out his team. The newly-appointed president of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) asked for the names of the company’s best senior leaders. After some time, he received 15 names. Just one belonged to a woman. “It was then that I realized that my team wasn’t as successful as it could be,” Hegarty said in an interview with Fortune at the annual Dell World conference in Austin, Texas. “Leaders tend to bring people in that have similar experiences, but to excel you need a really diverse team.” Hegarty, who now also co-leads Dell’s EMEA women’s network, says diversity is good for Dell not just from an ethical standpoint. He champions bringing in more female leaders because he can see the results in the company’s financial statements. In 2011, roughly 7% of his leadership team was female. Now, women make up a third of his team, and he believes that Dell’s business in the region has benefited tremendously from the diversity. “I see it in our business, our results and our performance,” he said. “It’s there. No question.” Hegarty’s comments were echoed in a subsequent panel discussion on closing the gender gap in IT. Nasrin Rezai, chief technology risk officer at financial services firm State Street, said if men are going to take gender diversity seriously, you need to show them how it can increase performance. Having worked with mostly male execs for her entire career, Rezai says men are very transaction-focused. If you show them that investing in more female talent will generate a higher return, they will most likely be interested. Anna Beninger, director of research at Catalyst, said Hegarty’s and Rezai’s personal experiences are both spot on with what she sees in her studies. Companies with women on boards and in executive leadership positions have been found to . Once male executives leaders realize they could lose market share by not making their teams as diverse as their customers or clients, they start to listen. To get more men actively thinking about diversity and gender inclusion, Catalyst launched an online community called Men Advocating For Real Change. MARC also offers a six-month program for men committed to achieving gender equality in their workplaces. Dell is the first (and only) IT company to sign on to Catalyst’s initiative (so far). “When you’re a white male, it’s hard to know what it’s like to be anything other than a white male,” said Beninger. “This program goes beyond awareness to action.” Hegarty acknowledges that Dell and the IT industry have a long way to go. Yet each time he has a conversation on the topic, he says he makes sure to push himself to learn more about experiences outside of his own. After all, his bottom line could very well depend on it. “We won’t stop until we have 50% women in leadership,” he said. “That’s when we know we truly share our customers’ experiences.” To subscribe to Caroline Fairchild’s daily newsletter on the world’s most powerful women, go towww.getbroadsheet.com.

We told the doctor to let him order whatever glasses he wanted and that we would pay for them.

The statement and the scenario provided can be consistent with each other, but there is not enough information in the sentence to draw a definite conclusion that the woman is walking along the beach. Various factors come into play when evaluating the logical connection between the two statements: 1. Ambiguity of the location: In the given scenario, it is only mentioned that the woman is walking in front of water. This description may include a wide range of possible locations such as a beach, a lake, a river, or even a pool. Without more information, it is not possible to determine where exactly the woman is. 2. Interpretation of words: The term \\"beach\\" is a more specific location compared to the term \\"water.\\" A beach typically refers to a sandy or pebbly shore, whereas water can refer to any body of water, including oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and ponds. The limited information provided makes it difficult to establish a more precise connection between the woman's location and whether she is walking along a beach. 3. Additional context: More context would be required to draw a conclusion that the woman is walking along the beach. For example, if it was stated that the woman was walking along a sandy shoreline, it would provide more evidence for the conclusion. However, without additional contextual information, it is not logical to assume that the woman is on a beach. In conclusion, while the scenario and the statement can be consistent with each other, the limited information provided does not allow for a logical and definite conclusion that the woman is walking along the beach. The presence of water simply implies that she is walking near a body of water, and without more information about the nature of the water or the location, any assumption regarding her walking on a beach would be speculative rather than logical."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Don't avoid the subject. Before you have the talk, take some time to think about where you stand on the issues. For example, ask yourself if you are comfortable with teens having sex. If not, think about how you will encourage abstinence. You can also think about whether or not you believe in birth control for teens. Let your teen know that you are happy to talk to them about sex. In fact, you can even initiate a conversation. You could say something like, “Lauren, since you're heading to college, I wanted to talk about ways to practice safe sex. Is now a good time?” You want your teen to know that they can come to you for help and support. In order for communication to work, you need to be honest. That doesn't mean that you have to reveal your entire sexual history to your teen. It just means that you should be prepared to answer questions like, “Did you wait until you were married to have sex?” If you're honest, you're providing your teen with helpful information that can help them make good choices. Your teen might also ask things like, \\"What should I do if I'm feeling pressured to have sex?\\" or \\"Can I get pregnant from oral sex?\\" Your teen might not feel comfortable talking to you about sex. That's normal! Just make sure that you encourage them to get educated about safe sex. If there is an optional sex ed class at their school, encourage them to sign up. If their school doesn't offer that, check with your local community center or hospital. They might have some community classes. You might also need some more information yourself. You want to be informed when you answer questions. Check out Planned Parenthood's site, or ask your doctor for some current literature. And don't hesitate to head to the local library! Make a point to know who is in your teen's life. If they are dating, ask them to introduce you to their partner. You can also ask your teen questions like, “You and Katie seem to be getting serious. Have you two talked about sex?” If you have any concerns about the relationship, talk to the teen about them. Try not to be judgmental. You don't want your teen to feel embarrassed to talk to you. For example, don't say, \\"Oh, you're not really in love. You're just a kid!\\" Share concerns instead of judgments. Say, \\"It worries me that Tom seems a little controlling. How do you feel?\\" instead of \\"I hate Tom.\\"","completion":"Before talking to your teen about sex, think about your own views on topics like abstinence and birth control. Tell your teen you're open to talking about sex, and even start the conversation yourself. Be honest when answering questions but don't feel like you need to share everything about your past. Encourage your teen to learn about safe sex and make sure you're informed too. Get to know their friends or partners and ask questions about their relationships.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff.

(CNN) -- In an effort to galvanize support for a new pair of rail tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey, two U.S. senators from the Garden State announced Monday that Amtrak would bear some of the costs. The 13.5 billion Gateway Tunnel project would add high-speed and commuter rail service between the two states by 2020, replacing an earlier project that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, rejected after citing budget concerns. \\"New Jersey is facing a transportation crisis,\\" Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg said Monday. He said residents were \\"fed up\\" with train delays and \\"endless traffic\\" on New Jersey highways. Christie said that there was obligations potentially for the taxpayers of","completion":"New Jersey to come up with a 70% funding for the project, which he deemed unreasonable and unaffordable. However, the new proposal has Amtrak taking up a significant portion of the costs, making it more feasible and potentially alleviating the burden on New Jersey taxpayers. Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Bob Menendez, both Democrats, are working tirelessly in bringing this project to fruition, as they believe it is essential for the continued growth and economic development of not only New Jersey but also the entire region. There are several reasons why the Gateway Tunnel project is necessary and beneficial for both states: 1. Increased capacity: The new pair of rail tunnels would dramatically increase the rail capacity between New York and New Jersey, as they would allow more trains to pass under the Hudson River. Currently, there are only two rail tunnels that connect the two states, which severely limits the number of trains that can move between them. This has created a bottleneck situation, leading to frequent delays and congestion. 2. Enhanced transportation options: The Gateway Tunnel project would provide better commuting options for residents of both states. With the growing population and increasing demand for public transportation, the project is expected to improve the overall quality of life for those who commute between New York and New Jersey. Improved transit options would also encourage more people to rely on public transportation instead of personal vehicles, which could help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions. 3. Economic growth and development: The Gateway Tunnel project is expected to create thousands of jobs during its construction phase and subsequent operation. Furthermore, it will also contribute to the overall economic growth of both states by making it easier for businesses to operate across state lines, attracting new investment, and fostering a more interconnected regional economy. 4. Aging infrastructure: The current rail tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey were built over a century ago and have suffered from years of wear and tear, as well as damage from natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The Gateway Tunnel project would provide much-needed upgrades to the aging infrastructure, ensuring the safety and reliability of rail transit between the two states. 5. High-speed rail: One of the key features of the Gateway Tunnel project is the integration of high-speed rail service that could significantly reduce travel time between major east coast cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Improved intercity connections would make it easier for people to travel for work or leisure, further boosting the region's economic growth and development. Despite the initial concerns raised by Gov. Chris Christie, the new proposal for the Gateway Tunnel project has gained traction and support due to Amtrak's willingness to share in the project's costs. This major infrastructure initiative could potentially transform the region's transportation landscape and provide much-needed upgrades to existing facilities. As a result, the Gateway Tunnel project is poised to become a vital part of the region's infrastructure, enhancing both the quality of life and economic growth for the citizens of New York and New Jersey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels.

A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf.

We bear a sacred responsibility to honor America's varied faith traditions and to promote a culture of mutual respect and the assurance of religious freedom for all. In advance of the ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we announce a new era of interfaith cooperation. While the original impetus for the meeting was the rising tension over the Park 51 Islamic Community Center planned for two blocks north of Ground Zero, the determination of a Florida church to burn the Quran on the anniversary of 9/11 also spurred the leaders outrage. We are profoundly distressed and deeply saddened by the incidents of violence committed against Muslims in our community, and by the desecration of Islamic houses of worship. We stand by the principle that to attack any religion in the United States is to do violence to the religious freedom of all Americans. The threatened burning of copies of the Holy Qu'ran this Saturday is a particularly egregious offense that demands the strongest possible condemnation by all who value civility in public life and seek to honor the sacred memory of those who lost their lives on September 11. As religious leaders, we are appalled by such disrespect for a sacred text that for centuries has shaped many of the great cultures of our world, and that continues to give spiritual comfort to more than a billion Muslims today.

Their statement said, in part, All of us must ensure that our conversations on this matter remain civil, that our approaches to each other are marked with respect, and that our hearts stay free of bitterness. Can interfaith voices for calm, tolerance and reflection -- the love and morality taught by world religions -- overcome headlines for a church planning to burn the Quran? The Dove World Outreach Center, a tiny Florida church, is burning up the headlines with its plan, still on, according to On Deadline, to build a bonfire for the holy book of Islam, on September 11th. General David Petraeus has warned, in an e-mail to the Associated Press, that images of the bonfire is provoking international protests and could endanger U.S. troops. Meanwhile U.S. Muslims who would, in other years, have celebrated the conclusion of the Ramadan fast with Eid al-Fitr, three days of community parties, family feasts and gifts, have been cowed into dulling the bright days because they coincide with the September 11th terrorist attack's ninth anniversary. They fear being seen as celebrating the attacks, as if all believers were complicit with the political terrorists. And Feisal Abdul Rauf, the Sufi imam with a plan to build a community center and prayer room two blocks north of Ground Zero, has cut short a State-Department-backed speaking tour abroad to face the clamor back home. Is there any chance that anyone is listening to Gov. David Paterson? Confronted with the tensions of the Park 51 center plans, he looked at his calendar and mused, Perhaps we might think more in terms of supporting those families who are on both sides of this issue as all of us are and maybe all step back and try to devote a week of peace. A lifetime of peace would be more what the clergy who met today would hope. According to their press release, the summit meeting includes: Rev. Dr. Michael Kinnamon, general secretary of the National Council of Churches; Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington; Bishop Mark Sisk, the Episcopal Church's Bishop of New York; and Rabbi David Saperstein from the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. Leadership from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, The Foundation For Ethnic Understanding, the Archdiocese of New York and Archdiocese of Washington are also expected to participate. Who's missing? Well, for one, the folks from Florida with the matches. Terry Jones, pastor of the provocative Gainesville, Fla., church told CNN that even though they are praying and weighing their upcoming bonfire-without-a-permit, the protest he says is aimed at radical Islam is still on. Jones said, Once in awhile, you see that in the Bible, there are instances where enough is enough and you stand up. Who is standing up against Dove? Is anyone planning to show up at the Florida bonfire with fire hoses and buckets? Would you join such a water brigade? Can religions' words of love douse political and social flames -- even for a week, as the N.Y. governor suggests? Summary:","completion":"A group of clergy and religious leaders from various faiths held a summit in response to a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States. They asserted the importance of standing together against derision, misinformation, and bigotry directed at any religious group. The summit participants denounced the discrimination against America's Muslim community and sought to promote a culture of mutual respect and religious freedom. The planned burning of the Quran at a Florida church on September 11th was met with strong condemnation by the religious leaders at the summit, who expressed distress at violence committed against Muslims and desecration of Islamic houses of worship. Moreover, they emphasized that attacking any religion in the country violates the religious freedom of all Americans. The summit aimed to call for compassion, solidarity, and increased interfaith collaboration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Strange Brew Context: Bob and Doug McKenzie (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) are two dim-witted and unemployed \\"hosers\\" living in Toronto, Ontario who find themselves in a bind when they squander their father's beer money and then run out of beer. The brothers place a live mouse in a beer bottle in an attempt to blackmail the local beer store into giving them free Elsinore beer, but are told to take up the matter at the Elsinore brewery instead. After presenting the mouse to management at the brewery, the brothers are given jobs on the bottling line inspecting the bottles for mice. They take this opportunity to drink lots of free beer off the line; later, they present their parents with a van full of free Elsinore beer products as part of their payment with their new jobs.Meanwhile, the evil owner of the brewery, Brewmeister \\"B.M.\\" Smith (Max von Sydow), is perfecting a secret plan to take over the world by placing a mind-control drug in Elsinore beer which, while rendering the consumer docile, also makes him or her attack others when stimulated by certain musical tones. Smith tests this adulterated beer on patients of the conveniently located Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane, which is connected by underground tunnels to the brewery. The effects of the tainted beer are demonstrated in an extended sequence during which the mental patients don armored Star Wars-style hockey garb and, after consuming the beer, respond to synthesizer music by variously playing hockey, skating together in sync, and brawling on the ice.It seems the former brewery owner John Elsinore has recently died under mysterious circumstances and his daughter, Pam (Lynne Griffin), having recently turned 21, has been given full control of the Elsinore brewery. Pam's incompetent uncle Claude (Paul Dooley), in the interim, had married her widowed mother and is reluctant to give up his recently-gained control of the brewery.

John Winston Ono Lennon (9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter and peace activist who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group achieved worldwide fame during the 1960s. In 1969, Lennon started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono, and he continued to pursue a solo career following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970. Born John Winston Lennon in Liverpool, he became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Further to his Plastic Ono Band singles such as \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and \\"Instant Karma!\\", Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as \\"Working Class Hero\\", \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\". After moving to New York City in 1971, he never returned to England again. In 1975, he disengaged himself from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release. Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. From 1971 onwards, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. By 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He had 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer or performer.

Introduction: If you have been scrolling through social media or flipping through your local newspaper lately, there's a good chance you've come across the heartwarming story of Mike and McKenzie Carey. The inspirational Indiana couple have been making headlines for their unwavering commitment to each other and their unshakable determination to overcome incredible odds together. In this exclusive interview with People.com, we delve into the couple's extraordinary journey, exploring how perseverance, exceptional love, and a supportive community can make the seemingly impossible possible. Meet Mike and McKenzie Carey: Mike Carey, 33, and McKenzie Rattray, 29, met back in 2012 through a mutual friend. At that time, the two had no idea that their relationship would blossom into a deep and meaningful connection born out of love and a shared sense of purpose. What brought them together in such a unique and incredible partnership was a devastating circumstance - McKenzie's battle with the rare neurological disorder, called Devic's (Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or NMOSD). When their paths crossed, Mike was studying business management, and McKenzie, a vibrant and lively young woman, was a professional model. Much to everyone's surprise, they instantly clicked, and just a few months later, the couple was inseparable. They fell head over heels in love, and their emotional bond only grew stronger, despite the diagnosis that would change their lives forever. Facing the Challenges Together: The beauty and strength of their relationship were tested when McKenzie, an aspiring model, began experiencing symptoms that soon spiraled, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down and blind in one eye. Devic's disease, an autoimmune disorder, is similar to Multiple Sclerosis and attacks the body's spinal cord and optic nerves. The prognosis was dire, but Mike refused to let it define their relationship. In the face of this adversity, Mike became McKenzie's full-time caregiver, never wavering in his devotion and providing the unwavering love and emotional support McKenzie needed to face the harrowing challenges. They didn't allow the pressing odds to stand between them. Together, they began an uphill battle, determined to fight for McKenzie's health and ability to walk again. From Hospital to Home and the Community's Support: The couple spent considerable time in hospitals and rehabilitation centers, taking on the challenge with tenacity and courage. Throughout this journey, they gained immense support from well-wishers and members of their community. They received countless heartfelt messages and acts of kindness from friends, family, and total strangers who were touched by their love story and resilience. The local community held fundraisers, and multiple GoFundMe campaigns took off, seeking the necessary funds to cover McKenzie's medical bills and ongoing physiotherapy treatments. This wave of solidarity helped the couple navigate the financial stresses and unexpected costs that accompanied the devasting diagnosis. Making Progress and Achieving Milestones: Despite the odds, Mike and McKenzie have achieved a series of milestones together. Their countless hours of hard work and sheer determination are paying off. McKenzie is now able to stand with the assistance of leg braces and has made substantial progress in her rehabilitation. Part of their story that went viral on social media was the breathtaking moment when Mike and McKenzie shared their first dance at a friend's wedding. With Mike's support, McKenzie was able to stand, and the couple swayed to the music as guests wiped away the tears. This emotional and symbolic moment truly encapsulated the power and resilience of the human spirit. Conclusion: The love story of Mike and McKenzie Carey is a testament to the power of love, determination, and unwavering support. Their journey has shattered the boundaries of what many deemed impossible and has inspired countless others facing similar challenges in their lives. Through their ability to believe and fight beyond limits, Mike and McKenzie have shown the world that as long as there is hope, love, and commitment, there's always a chance for a miracle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The two attackers, whom are presumably agents of another military power, make off with a box containing samples of 'Death One'.

The other accidently infects himself by touching the fluid leaking from the case, but manages to escape to a nearby hotel. He checks in and holes up in his room, seriously ill.

Answer the following question: Where were infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end. Answer:","completion":"The infant mortality rates were as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century on the islands visited by Norman Heathcote, specifically Hirta, which is part of the St Kildan archipelago. The context confirms that the high infant mortality rates were due to previously unknown diseases brought by steamers, especially tetanus infantum. This high infant mortality rate occurred despite the economic benefits that came with the arrival of the steamers, such as the sale of tweeds and bird's eggs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To continue, your doctor may also recommend stool softeners if you have recently given birth and are experiencing difficulty with your bowel movements. Common brands of stool softeners which might be suggested by your doctor include Col-Rite, Colace, DSS, Diocto, Dulcolax, Docusil, and Fleet Sof-Lax. The targeted use of stool softeners isn't limited to a specific age group or condition. Postpartum women often struggle due to the increase in progesterone levels during pregnancy that drastically slow down the transit of food through their digestive tract, leading to constipation. Similarly, individuals suffering from hemorrhoids or any other bowel issues are also likely beneficiaries of stool softeners. Hemorrhoids are a common ailment which can be caused by straining during bowel movements, obesity or pregnancy. The recommended stool softeners relieve the discomfort caused by these conditions by retaining fluids in the stool and making it easy and painless to pass. Stool softeners are also likely to be beneficial to the elderly, who often suffer from chronic constipation due to slowed gut activities triggered by a variety of factors like decreased physical activity, inadequate fiber or fluid intake, or certain medications. However, it's worth stressing again that you should only start taking these medicines after receiving a proper prescription from your qualified healthcare provider. Professionals have the authority and knowledge to keep track of your health status and adjust your medication type or dosage as needed. While some stool softeners can be purchased over the counter, a prescription from your doctor ensures you use the right drugs that are not only effective but also safe for your current health condition. In all cases and for all patients, the instructions provided by the doctor should be meticulously followed. Misuse or overuse of stool softeners could lead to unpleasant or dangerous side effects. So, always ensure you adhere strictly to your doctor’s instructions regarding the use of these medications. In summary, stool softeners are a widely recommended and effective treatment for various conditions that affect bowel movements. Whether you’re a new mom trying to cope with postpartum bowel irregularities, or a patient suffering from hemorrhoids, taking prescribed stool softeners can considerably alleviate your discomfort, make bowel movements easier, and improve your overall quality of life.

To do that, we'll subtract 93 from both sides of the equation. -3*z + 93 - 93 = 120 - 93 -3*z = 27 Step 2: Now we have -3*z = 27. We need to find the value of z, so we will divide both sides of the equation by -3. (-3*z) / -3 = 27 / -3 z = -9 There you go! We found the value of z, which is -9.

Robert Black from the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Marylandwas the leading writer of the research. He says more than 3.5 million mothers and children under five die in poor countries each year because of hunger. He says more than two million children die from underdevelopment, either before or after birth. Millions of others who survive face a lifetime of disabilities or early death. And the effects are not just physical. Poor brain development can limit economic success as children become adults. Then the cycle of poverty and hunger often repeats for their children. Doctor Black says hungry children are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease as adults. He says the studies show that food programs need to place the greatest importance on the first two years of life. Hungry children can suffer the whole life damage from age two.

What is the title of this article: The Christian population of the empire, owing to their higher educational levels, started to pull ahead of the Muslim majority, leading to much resentment on the part of the latter. In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology. In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy. In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks. Of course, it would be a mistake to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of this dynamic. The preponderance of Christian merchants owed not to any innate business sense on their part, although plenty of European observers were keen on making this point. In fact, in many cases, Christians and also Jews were able to gain protection from European consuls and citizenship, meaning they were protected from Ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their Muslim comrades.

Stephen Arthur Stills (born January 3, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Beginning his professional career with Buffalo Springfield, he composed one of their few hits \\"For What It's Worth,\\" which became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills, Furay, and Young reunited in Los Angeles and formed the core of Buffalo Springfield. Legend has it that Stills and Furay recognized Young's converted hearse on the streets of LA and flagged him down, a meeting described in a recent solo track \\"Round the Bend.\\" The band would release three albums: Buffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield Again, and Last Time Around, and enjoy only one hit single, the Stills-penned \\"For What It's Worth\\" before disbanding. A Stills song from their debut album, \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You,\\" was a minor hit for the Mojo Men in 1967. During the disintegration of Buffalo Springfield, Stills played on the Super Session album with Al Kooper and joined up with David Crosby, who had recently been ejected from the Byrds in the autumn of 1967. At a party in Laurel Canyon, Crosby was introduced to Graham Nash by a mutual friend, Cass Elliot (formerly of the Mamas and the Papas), and Nash found himself soon joining in singing with Crosby and Stills. Renditions of the latter's \\"You Don't Have to Cry,\\" led to the formation of Crosby, Stills & Nash. Several of Stills's songs, including \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" and \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\" on the debut album were inspired by his on-again-off-again relationship with singer Judy Collins. In a 1971 interview in Rolling Stone the interviewer noted, \\"so many of your songs seem to be about Judy Collins.\\" Stills replied, \\"Well, there are three things men can do with women: love them, suffer for them, or turn them into literature. I've had my share of success and failure at all three.\\" The cover photo pictured on the debut was taken on the back porch of a house in West Hollywood, which was torn down the next day. Wanting to be able to tour and needing additional musicians, the band invited Neil Young to join them for their subsequent tour and second album to make the group the quartet Crosby Stills Nash & Young. Having played at the Monterey Pop Festival with Buffalo Springfield, and both Woodstock and Altamont with CSNY, Stills performed at all three of the iconic U.S. rock festivals of the 1960s. Did the group ever break up?","completion":"Yes, the group Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) experienced multiple breakups and reunions throughout their history. The group initially formed in 1968 with the core trio of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash, with Neil Young joining later that same year. Following the release of their second album \\"Déjà Vu\\" in 1970, tensions between the band members started to rise, primarily due to creative differences and personal issues. In 1970, Neil Young began focusing on his solo career and collaborating with other musicians. This marked the beginning of the band's numerous lineup changes over the years. After the release of their live album \\"4 Way Street\\" in 1971, the group went on an indefinite hiatus, with each member pursuing solo projects or collaborations with other musicians. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young officially disbanded in the early 1970s after the hiatus. However, this was not the end of their story. The band members, individually or in various combinations, continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects throughout the 1970s. In 1974, the group briefly reunited for a successful stadium tour, but tensions between the members persisted, and they did not release another album as CSNY for over a decade. In 1988, the band (with Neil Young) reunited again and released the album \\"American Dream.\\" Unfortunately, the album received mixed reviews, which seemed to hinder the group's motivation to continue working together. CSNY, as a group, again disbanded after that release. Since then, the members have continued to work individually and occasionally, in different configurations, have reunited for performances or short tours. In 1999, they released the album \\"Looking Forward,\\" but it failed to achieve the same level of success as their earlier work. There has not been a full-scale reunion or new material from all four members since then. To summarize, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young broke up multiple times due to creative differences, personal tensions, and a desire to work on individual projects. Despite occasional reunions and sporadic collaborations, the group never managed to consistently stay together or recreate the success of their earlier work. However, the individual members still maintain a significant impact on the music industry and have had notable careers on their own."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To begin building structure, teens need love and trust. They need to know their parents arc there to give them needed love and support .Teens want to be sure that nothing can prevent parents from shouldering their responsibility for them -- not their growing maturity ,misbehavior, nor anger at something they have done. Teens want parents to keep control while allowing them to make some decisions. There are some ways you can help your teens create reasonable structure and remain close. One way is to spend time together. Parents often mistake their teens' increased interest in friends for a disinterest in the family. Teens would like to spend more time doing things with their parents, but watching TV is not counted as spending time together. As your teens mature, it is important for you and your teens spend time alone together, one to one. Your teens need time to talk to you alone without any other family member present. Talk with your teens about their interests and concerns. Make sure you really show interest in what is happening. When talking with your teens, give full attention and do not stop them. The way to help your teens become adults is to let your teens into your world. Sharing your emotions and concerns with your teens is important. Avoid causing needless worry. Trust your teens. Don't expect the worst. Hope for the best. Telling your teens you don't like their friends will cause the teens not to bring their friends home. If something should go wrong, believe that your teens didn't do it on purpose. It is very important that you treat your teens with respect.

Mechanics work with repairing and maintaining vehicles, not cleaning them. So, option A is less suitable. B. oil engine - An oil engine refers to an engine that uses oil as a fuel. While a mechanic might work with engines, this option is quite specific and doesn't encompass the broader duties of a mechanic. So, option B is less suitable. C. servicing airplane - Airplane mechanics or aircraft technicians do service airplanes, but the question does not specify what kind of mechanic we're discussing. Since the term \\"mechanic\\" is broad and can include various types of mechanics, option C is less suitable. D. machine parts - Mechanics work with a wide range of machine parts to diagnose, repair, and maintain various types of machines like cars, trucks, and other vehicles. This option is more general and applies to the broader scope of a mechanic's duties. So, option D is more suitable. E. machine tool - While mechanics may use machine tools during their work, it is not the primary focus of their duties.

Son apparente défaillance morale est amplifiée par le fait qu’au même moment, la Russie menace de stopper l’approvisionnement en gaz de l’Ukraine si celle-ci ne cède pas aux exigences tarifaires de Gazprom, le géant gazier propriété d’État du Kremlin. Translate to English.","completion":"The perceived moral failure appears to be magnified by the fact that, at the same time, Russia is threatening to halt gas supplies to Ukraine if it does not yield to the pricing demands of Gazprom, the state-owned gas giant of the Kremlin. In this context, the issue of apparent moral failure possibly refers to the behavior of a political figure, a government, or an organization in connection to the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine. The situation is described as being exacerbated due to the Russian government, through Gazprom, using its control over gas supplies as leverage against Ukraine. This action is perceived as morally questionable, as it puts additional pressure on Ukraine and may have consequences on the country's energy security and the well-being of its citizens. Gazprom, as a state-owned company, acts in accordance with the interests of the Russian government, which is led by the Kremlin. The Kremlin's influence over Gazprom and its actions in the European energy market is a matter of concern for many, as it can be used as a tool for political pressure on other countries, especially those that rely heavily on Russian gas. In this particular case, the moral failure lies in the fact that, in an attempt to achieve its objectives related to the gas supply to Ukraine, Russia is resorting to tactics that are considered as having negative consequences for the affected country. By exploiting Ukraine's reliance on Russian gas and pushing for potentially unfavorable pricing conditions, Russia may be viewed as violating principles of international cooperation and good neighborly relations. This kind of behavior also raises concerns about energy security and diversification of energy supply in Europe, as such moves by Russia could have broader implications for the entire region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"The first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks is the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. This natural process takes place when rocks are exposed to various environmental factors such as air, water, wind, temperature fluctuations, and other geological phenomena. Over time, these elements work together to cause the breakdown and loosening of the rock's minerals and particles. During weathering, rocks are chemically or mechanically altered and broken down into smaller fragments, such as sand, pebbles, silt, or clay. Chemical weathering occurs when reactions between water, air, or other substances lead to the dissolution or disintegration of rock minerals. Mechanical weathering, on the other hand, is the physical abrasion or breaking apart of a rock due to temperature changes, the action of ice, or the force of wind and water. After weathering breaks down the rocks, erosion comes into play. The disintegrated rock particles, collectively called sediment, are transported by agents such as water, wind, or ice. This process often takes a considerable amount of time and can span large distances, depending on the erosion agent and specific regional or geographical conditions. The sediment will then be deposited in another location, typically where the transporting agent loses its energy or encounters a barrier. Over time, layer upon layer of sediment accumulates, gradually becoming compacted and cemented together under pressure and natural chemical reactions. This process, known as lithification, eventually transforms the deposited sediment into sedimentary rock. In summary, the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is the weathering of pre-existing rocks, which leads to the erosion and transport of sediment. This complex geological process incorporates a series of steps that ultimately result in the creation of new rocks formed from the broken-down material of older rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium and allow to simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beets are tender. Strain the water from the beets into a clean pot. I recommend this choice because, by simmering the beets until they are tender, you will be able to extract more sugar from them. When the beets are hard, they will not release as much sugar into the water, resulting in a less concentrated sugar solution. Here is the detailed process to make beet sugar from sugar beets: 1. Preparation: Wash the sugar beets thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. You can use a vegetable brush to clean them properly. Once cleaned, remove both the root end and the leafy top from the beets, and discard them. 2. Dicing the beets: Using a sharp knife, cut the beets into small, evenly-sized cubes. Dicing the beets will help to release the sugars more efficiently during the cooking process as it increases the surface area. 3. Cooking the beets: Place the diced beets into a large pot and fill it with water until the beets are completely covered. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium and allow it to simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beets are tender. Regularly check the beets and add more water if necessary, ensuring they remain submerged throughout the cooking process. 4. Straining step: Once the beets are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the water from the beets into a clean pot using a fine mesh strainer. Press the beets with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. The liquid you obtain, known as beet juice, is the basis for making beet sugar. 5. Concentrating the juice: Place the pot with the beet juice on medium heat and let it simmer, stirring occasionally. Let the juice reduce down, evaporating the water and concentrating the sugar content. This process may take a few hours. Once it reaches a syrupy consistency, remove the pot from heat. 6. Crystallizing the sugar: Allow the syrup to cool down to room temperature, and then cover it with a clean cloth or plastic wrap. Place it in a cool dark place and let it stand undisturbed for several days, allowing the sugar to crystallize. 7. Harvesting the sugar: Once you've got a layer of sugar crystals formed on the surface and at the bottom of the pot, you can start collecting them. Use a clean spoon or spatula to gather the sugar crystals, and then spread them on a clean paper or a baking sheet to air dry for a day or two. 8. Storing the beet sugar: Once completely dried, transfer the beet sugar to an airtight container and store it in a cool, dry place. You can now use this homemade beet sugar as a natural sweetener in recipes, just like regular granulated sugar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A police cruiser draped in black banners and topped with a rose sat in front of the Jupiter, Florida, police department Monday morning, paying testament to a 20-year department veteran killed Sunday while helping escort President Barack Obama through Palm Beach County. Officer Bruce St. Laurent, 55, was traveling with the presidential motorcade around 4:45 p.m. Sunday southbound on Interstate 95 through West Palm Beach when he pulled his motorcycle onto an on ramp, so he could stop traffic from accessing the highway, according to a statement released Monday by Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera. The statement said St. Laurent drove into the path of a 1994 Ford F150 driven by Susan Holloway, 56, of West Palm Beach, as she was accelerating to merge onto the interstate. Holloway hit the brakes to avoid the crash, but she hit St. Laurent's motorcycle, knocking the officer from his motorcycle and trapping him under her pickup when the vehicles came to rest, the statement said. Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzerow said St. Laurent was transported to nearby St. Mary's Medical Center, where he died Sunday. Barbera told CNN the statement details preliminary findings, and the ongoing investigation \\"could take months.\\" When the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Highway Patrol complete their investigation, state attorneys will determine whether any charges will be filed in the case.

Coming off their win over the Redskins and subsequent bye week, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. A 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to tight end Julius Thomas in the first quarter gave the Broncos the early lead. Two second-quarter field goals by Chargers' placekicker Nick Novak &#8212; from 26 and 40 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Broncos lead. However, the Broncos struck back, with Manning connecting on three touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas &#8212; an 11-yarder, a 7-yarder just before halftime and a 34-yarder on the opening possession of the second half, which increased the Broncos' lead to 28-6. On the Broncos' next possession, Chargers' linebacker Tourek Williams forced a fumble off Manning deep in Broncos' territory, and the Chargers immediately capitalized two plays later, with quarterback Philip Rivers throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Danny Woodhead. The Chargers further narrowed the Broncos' lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back Ryan Mathews rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to pull to within 28-20 with 10:44 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Chargers' defense forced a punt on the Broncos' next possession, and with 6:43 left in the game, the Chargers tried to rally, however, the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt with 3:37 remaining, and the Broncos' offense subsequently ran out the clock.

First, let's break down the phrase \\"the ball was in Lucy's court\\" and then analyze each of the provided options before explaining why \\"gymnasium\\" serves as the most suitable answer. The phrase \\"the ball was in Lucy's court\\" refers to a situation where Lucy has the power or responsibility to take the next action or decision. In this particular context, it is also mentioned that Lucy plays handball all the time. Handball is a competitive, fast-paced sport that involves two teams throwing, catching, and bouncing a small ball within a specially designed court. Now let's consider each of the given options: 1. Field: Although some sports, like soccer or football, are played on a field, handball is an indoor sport with a specific court. So, a field would not be an appropriate location for Lucy to play handball. 2. Street: Handball is not typically played in the street. Streets are common places for more informal games like street basketball, soccer, or skateboarding. Handball requires a specific court with marked boundaries and goal areas. 3. Playground: While playgrounds are designed for recreational activities, they generally do not have the appropriate facilities, such as the specialized handball court and goal structures, for organized sports like handball. 4. Bearing: Bearing is a term not related to a location where a sport can be played, as it refers to the direction or position of something, or to a part in a machine that supports rotation. Thus, it is not a possible answer to the question. 5. Gymnasium: A gymnasium is an indoor facility designed for various sports and physical activities, often including a variety of courts and equipment. Handball is typically played in a gymnasium with the specific, marked court necessary for the sport. Given the context and analysis of each option, a human would choose \\"gymnasium\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most appropriate location for Lucy to play handball. It offers the correct facilities, suitable environment, and is a common place to find sports like handball being played. The gymnasium caters to Lucy's athletic needs and provides the proper setting for a handball court, making it the optimal choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth.

Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers.

Here is a news article: For most of the past six weeks, the biggest story out of Silicon Valley was Apple's battle with the FBI over a federal order to unlock the iPhone of a mass shooter. The company's refusal touched off a searing debate over privacy and security in the digital age. But this morning, at a small office in Mountain View, California, three guys made the scope of that enormous debate look kinda small. Mountain View is home to WhatsApp, an online messaging service now owned by tech giant Facebook, that has grown into one of the world's most important applications. More than a billion people trade messages, make phone calls, send photos, and swap videos using the service. This means that only Facebook itself runs a larger self-contained communications network. And today, the enigmatic founders of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, together with a high-minded coder and cryptographer who goes by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike, revealed that the company has added end-to-end encryption to every form of communication on its service. Michael Friberg for WIRED This means that if any group of people uses the latest version of WhatsApp—whether that group spans two people or ten—the service will encrypt all messages, phone calls, photos, and videos moving among them. And that's true on any phone that runs the app, from iPhones to Android phones to Windows phones to old school Nokia flip phones. With end-to-end encryption in place, not even WhatsApp's employees can read the data that's sent across its network. In other words, WhatsApp has no way of complying with a court order demanding access to the content of any message, phone call, photo, or video traveling through its service. Like Apple, WhatsApp is, in practice, stonewalling the federal government, but it's doing so on a larger front—one that spans roughly a billion devices. \\"Building secure products actually makes for a safer world, (though) many people in law enforcement may not agree with that,\\" says Acton, who was employee number forty-four at Internet giant Yahoo before co-founding WhatsApp in 2009 alongside Koum, one of his old Yahoo colleagues. With encryption, Acton explains, anyone can conduct business or talk to a doctor without worrying about eavesdroppers. With encryption, he says, you can even be a whistleblower—and not worry. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment for this story. But many inside the government and out are sure to take issue with the company's move. In late 2014, WhatsApp encrypted a portion of its network. In the months since, its service has apparently been used to facilitate criminal acts, including the terrorist attacks on Paris last year. According to The New York Times, as recently as this month, the Justice Department was considering a court case against the company after a wiretap order (still under seal) ran into WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption. \\"The government doesn't want to stop encryption,\\" says Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in cybercrime and has represented various law enforcement agencies backing the Justice Department and the FBI in their battle with Apple. \\"But the question is: what do you do when a company creates an encryption system that makes it impossible for court-authorized search warrants to be executed? What is the reasonable level of assistance you should ask from that company?\\" WhatsApp declined to discuss any particular wiretap orders. But the prospect of a court case doesn't move Acton and Koum. Espousing an article of faith that's commonly held among Silicon Valley engineers—sometimes devoutly, sometimes casually—they believe that online privacy must be protected against surveillance of all kinds. \\"We're somewhat lucky here in the United States, where we hope that the checks and balances hold out for many years to come and decades to come. But in a lot of countries you don't have these checks and balances,\\" says Koum, dressed in his usual T-shirt and hoodie. Coming from Koum, this is not an academic point, as most of WhatsApp's users are outside the US. \\"The argument can be made: Maybe you want to trust the government, but you shouldn't because you don't know where things are going to go in the future.\\" Michael Friberg for WIRED Acton and Koum started adding encryption to WhatsApp back in 2013 and then redoubled their efforts in 2014 after they were contacted by Marlinspike. The dreadlocked coder runs an open source software project, Open Whisper Systems, that provides encryption for messaging services. In tech security and privacy circles, Marlinspike is a well-known idealist. But the stance he has taken alongside Acton and Koum—not to mention the other WhatsApp engineers who worked on the project and the braintrust at Facebook that's backing the effort—is hardly extreme in the context of Silicon Valley's wider clash with governments and law enforcement over privacy. In Silicon Valley, strong encryption isn't really up for debate. Among tech's most powerful leaders, it's orthodoxy. And WhatsApp is encryption's latest champion. It sees itself as fighting the same fight as Apple and so many others. WhatsApp, more than any company before it, has taken encryption to the masses. What makes this move even more striking is that the company did this with such a tiny group of people. The company employs only about 50 engineers. And it took a team of only 15 of them to bring encryption to the company's one billion users—a tiny, technologically empowered group of individuals engaging in a new form of asymmetrical resistance to authority, standing up not only to the US government, but all governments. \\"Technology is an amplifier,\\" Acton says. \\"With the right stewards in place, with the right guidance, we can really effect positive change.\\" But of course, positive change is in the eye of the beholder. And these are technological stewards in the style of Silicon Valley: billionaires in cargo shorts and T-shirts who did something massive because they wanted to. And because they could. Connecting the World Like so many tech startups, WhatsApp's success seems a bit accidental. Acton and Koum originally conceived of their app as a way for people to broadcast their availability to friends, family, and colleagues: Could they talk or text at that very moment or not? But it soon morphed into a more general messaging app, a way to trade text messages via the Internet without using the SMS networks operated by cellular phone carriers like Verizon and AT&T. But the real genius of the app is that very early on, Acton and Koum targeted the international market. In the startup's first year, they offered the service in German, Spanish, French, and Italian, among other languages, and it rapidly took off overseas, where SMS text fees are much higher in than US. Today, the company offers the app in more than 50 languages, and it has grown into the primary social network in so many of the world's countries, including Brazil, India, and large parts of Europe. In many places, local wireless carriers have signed deals with WhatsApp to offer the service directly to their customers, undermining their own texting services but driving more people to use the wider Internet through their wireless networks—and thus driving more revenue. By February of 2014, WhatsApp had reached about 450 million users, and Facebook shelled out 19 billion to acquire the startup, with its staff of only 50 people. Since then, with only a slight expansion of staff, WhatsApp has come to serve more than a billion people across the globe. WIRED But the app's two founders, for all their success, have remained in the shadows. They almost never speak with the media. Koum, in particular, is largely uninterested in press or publicity or, for that matter, any human interaction he deems extraneous. \\"Clearly, you can't believe everything you read in the press,\\" he tells me, a reporter. Although the company runs one of the world's largest online services—and is owned by the world's biggest social network—it continues to operate almost entirely on its own in an unmarked building in Mountain View that's fronted by unusually diligent security. And because the app is far more popular overseas than in the US, the typically fervent Silicon Valley tech press has largely left them alone. As a result, the American public hasn't quite grasped the enormous scope of the company's encryption project or the motivations behind it. Koum and Acton share a long history in computer security. They first met at Yahoo while doing a security audit for the company. During this time, Koum was also part of a seminal security collective and think tank called w00w00 (pronounced \\"whoo whoo\\"), a tight online community that used the old IRC chat service to trade ideas related to virtually any aspect of the field. Koum grew up in the Ukraine under Soviet rule before immigrating to the US as a teenager, so he has some intimate familiarity with the challenges of maintaining privacy in the face of an intrusive government. But Koum says that the bigger force behind encrypting WhatsApp was Acton, a comparatively outgoing individual who grew up in Florida. \\"Brian gets a lot of credit for wanting to do it earlier,\\" Koum says of WhatsApp encryption. Michael Friberg for WIRED Indeed, it was Acton who first launched an effort to add encryption to WhatsApp back in 2013. \\"I don't really want to be in the business of observing conversations,\\" he says, adding that people were constantly asking the company for full encryption. \\"This is something our users wanted. Maybe not your average mom in middle America, but people on a worldwide basis.\\" At the start, however, the effort was little more than a prototype driven by a single WhatsApp intern. The project didn't really take off until Moxie Marlinspike remembered a WhatsApp guy—an engineer who worked on the version of WhatsApp for Windows phones—he had met at his girlfriend's family reunion. Meeting Moxie Moxie Marlinspike's girlfriend comes from a family of Russian physicists, and in 2013, she held a family reunion at the apartment she shared with Marlinspike. The guest list included about 23 Russian physicists and one American guy who worked as an engineer at WhatsApp. (He had married into the family.) Marlinspike chatted briefly with the engineer at the reunion. Then, about a year later, Marlinspike decided it was time to add encryption to WhatsApp, one of the world's largest messaging services. He sent the guy an email, asking for an introduction to the company's founders. The debate over encryption has only grown more intense. When I meet Marlinspike at WhatsApp headquarters, he is somewhat reticent to explain his motivations, which seems typical of the man—at least in interviews with the press. Online, however, he's not shy about his views. In the past, he has written that encryption is important because it gives anyone the ability to break the law. But in Mountain View, he is more laconic. \\"WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world,\\" says Marlinspike, who is not just a coder and cryptographer but a sailor and a shipwright. \\"I wanted to get in touch.” Given the reclusive proclivities of WhatsApp, knowing someone who knows someone is particularly important when it comes to making connections there. After the engineer helped make an introduction, Acton met Marlinspike at the Dana Street Roasting Company—a popular meeting place for Silicon Valley types. Then, a few weeks later, Marlinspike met with Koum. The two men, it turned out, had plenty in common. Marlinspike had come up in the same world of underground security gurus before joining Twitter in 2011—and promptly leaving the company to form Open Whisper Systems. \\"We talked about the IRC days,\\" Koum says of their meeting. \\"How things used to be.\\" The bond seemed to stick. Soon, Marlinspike was helping to build end-to-end encryption across all of WhatsApp, alongside Acton and Koum and a small team of WhatsApp engineers. Acton says that they got \\"lucky\\" in meeting Marlinspike and that they probably wouldn't have rolled out full encryption if they hadn't. It's part of an intriguing casualness to the way Acton and Koum discuss their seemingly earthshaking undertaking—not to mention the way Marlinspike stays largely silent. They met. They had the means. And they built it. It would take about two years. Michael Friberg for WIRED An Intensifying Debate The encrypting of WhatsApp was supposed to be finished by the middle of January 2016. Koum and company wanted to unveil a completely encrypted service at the DLD tech media conference in Munich, where he was set to give a proverbial fireside chat. Germany is a country that puts an unusually high value on privacy, both digital and otherwise, and Koum felt the time was ripe to make WhatsApp's plans known to the world. Just recently, a Brazilian court had ordered a temporary shutdown of WhatsApp in the country after the company failed to turn over messages to the government that had been sent across a part of the service that was already encrypted. In Germany, Koum could make his counterpoint. But by the middle of December, it was clear the project wouldn't be finished. The team was intent on encrypting everything on every kind of phone. \\"The last piece was video,\\" Koum says. \\"You need to build for a situation where somebody on Android can send a video to an S40 user. Or somebody on a Blackberry can send to a Windows phone.\\" So the company postponed the announcement. In Germany, Koum talked about WhatsApp's new business model instead. As Koum sees it, slipping a backdoor into an encrypted service would defeat the purpose. In the meantime, the debate over encryption has only grown more intense. On February 16, Apple CEO Tim Cook released an open letter refusing the court order to unlock a phone that belonged to one of the two shooters who killed 14 people and seriously injured another 22 during a December attack in San Bernardino, California. That day, Acton turned to Koum and said: \\"Tim Cook is my hero.\\" About two weeks later in Brazil, authorities arrested a Facebook vice president because WhatsApp wouldn't turn over messages after a court order. Apparently, the authorities didn't realize that the Facebook employee had nothing to do with WhatsApp—or that WhatsApp, thanks to end-to-end encryption, had no way of reading the messages. Two days later, WhatsApp joined Facebook and several other companies in filing an amicus brief in support of Apple in its fight against the FBI. Clearly, WhatsApp has the support of its much larger parent company. Facebook declined to speak specifically for this story. But Koum, after the WhatsApp acquisition, became a member of the Facebook board. \\"If they were not supportive of us, we wouldn’t be here today,\\" he says. But this also wasn't something Facebook imposed on WhatsApp. This is a decision WhatsApp made on its own, before it was acquired. By the time Facebook paid billions of dollars for the company, the transformation was already under way. No Backdoor Many lawmakers have called for companies like WhatsApp to equip their encryption schemes with a backdoor available only to law enforcement. There's even been talk of a law that requires these backdoors. But as Koum sees it, slipping a backdoor into an encrypted service would defeat the purpose: you might as well not encrypt it at all. A backdoor would just open the service to abuse by both government and hackers. Besides, if you did add a backdoor, or remove encryption from WhatsApp entirely, that wouldn't stop bad actors. They'd just go elsewhere. In the age of open source software, encryption tools are freely available to everyone. \\"The encryption genie is out of the bottle,\\" Koum says. Indeed, even some of those exploring legislation to require backdoors to encrypted digital services acknowledge that the issues in play aren't that simple. \\"If we require our companies to build in a door, do we need to let China through the door? Or do we have to build doors for them when these services are used in their countries?\\" asks Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \\"And what does that mean in terms of stifling dissent in authoritarian countries that may use it for non-law enforcement purposes?\\" When asked about reports that terrorists used WhatsApp to plan the attacks on Paris—reports that politicians have used to back calls for a backdoor—Koum doesn't budge. \\"I think this is politicians, in some ways, using these terrible acts to advance their agendas,\\" he says. \\"If the White House thinks that Twitter can solve their ISIS problem, they've got (a lot of problems).\\" WIRED Koum is right that encryption is widely available to anyone motivated to use it, but WhatsApp is pushing it much farther into the mainstream than anyone else. Apple, for instance, encrypts the data sitting on an iPhone, and it uses end-to-end encryption to hide the messages that travel over its own iMessage texting service. But iMessage is only available on iPhones. Over the years, Apple has sold about 800 million iPhones. But it's hard to know how many are still in use, or how many people who have them are communicating via iMessage anyway. WhatsApp runs on just about every kind of phone. Plus, Apple's techniques have some gaping holes. Most notably, many users back up their iMessages to Apple’s iCloud service, which negates the end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp, meanwhile, has a billion users on its service right now. Pundits have also made much of the encryption offered by Telegram, a messaging service built by a Russian entrepreneur who travels the world in self-imposed exile. But Telegram doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. And it doesn't do end-to-end encryption for group messaging. And it has only a fraction of the audience of WhatsApp. The New Status Quo In pushing back against end-to-end encryption, the US government argues that it's merely trying to maintain the status quo—that it has long had the power to issue a warrant for communications data. \\"This is the same principle applied to a different set of facts,\\" says DeMarco, the former federal prospector that has helped law enforcement agencies back the Justice Department against Apple. \\"This is about what companies should do when the government had gone to court and gotten a court order, either a search warrant or a wiretap or a data tap.\\" When I float this argument to Koum and Acton, they defer to Marlinspike—at first. Though the cryptographer is somewhat reticent to speak, when he does, he speaks with an idealist's conviction. \\"In some ways, you can think of end-to-end encryption as honoring what the past looked like,\\" he says. \\"Now, more and more of our communication is done over communication networks rather than face-to-face or other traditionally private means of communicating. Even written correspondence wasn't subject to mass surveillance the way that electronic communication is today.\\" Dressed in his standard uniform of T-shirt and cargo shorts, Acton agrees. \\"The phone is one hundred, one hundred and ten years old,\\" he says. \\"There was a middle period where the government had a broad ability to surveil, but if you look at human history in total, people evolved and civilizations evolved with private conversations and private speech. If anything, we're bringing that back to individuals.\\" Acton and Koum and Marlinspike believe all this no matter what the government might do or say. They're just doing what they want to do, and they're doing it because they can. Though The New York Times indicates that WhatsApp has received a wiretap order over encrypted data, Acton and Koum say they have had no real interaction with the government. But they probably will soon enough. Acton and Koum have almost complete control of one of the largest communication networks on Earth. They've met Moxie Marlinspike. The three of them share Silicon Valley's standard belief in online privacy. And now the government has to contend with something much bigger than a locked iPhone: secrecy for a billion people. Update: This story has been updated to clarify that Telegram does not do end-to-end encryption by default. It does use other encryption by default, but this does not provide the same level of security as end-to-end. ||||| In the wake of Apple’s encryption battle with the FBI, the latest version of Facebook’s popular messenger tool will add strong encryption to texts and calls WhatsApp is updating its messenger app so that every text and voice call on one of the world’s most popular apps will be protected with strong encryption – potentially putting millions more conversations outside the purview of authorities. The development at the messenger company, which is owned by Facebook, is striking given Silicon Valley’s recent staredown with authorities over user data privacy. The FBI dropped a court battle with Apple over its iPhone encryption, and Brazilian police recently arrested a Facebook executive because WhatsApp couldn’t provide messages sent by a criminal suspect. None of that appears to have deterred WhatsApp founder Jan Koum, who grew up in Soviet-era Ukraine amid surveillance fears and has said that he often heard his mother say things like, “This isn’t a telephone conversation.” “The desire to protect people’s private communication is one of the core beliefs we have at WhatsApp, and for me, it’s personal,” Koum wrote in a blog post published Tuesday. “I grew up in the USSR during communist rule and the fact that people couldn’t speak freely is one of the reasons my family moved to the United States.” The Guardian reported on WhatsApp’s plans in March. All of WhatsApp’s 1 billion users, when running the latest version of the app on iPhone, a Google Android device, Nokia or Blackberry, will send and receive messages, attachments and voice calls that engineers say can only be deciphered by the intended recipient, said Moxie Marlinspike, an encrypted messaging developer at Open Whisper Systems, whose technology forms the backbone of WhatsApp’s encryption. This means WhatsApp shouldn’t be able to facilitate a wiretap of the contents of users’ messages, even if faced with a court order. It’s unclear if the company will be able to help authorities intercept data on when they use WhatsApp or with whom they communicate. Additionally, WhatsApp will take the unusual step for a consumer app of notifying users if messages are encrypted, Marlinspike said. If several users are trading texts in a group message and one of the users is running an older version of the app that doesn’t support encrypted group messages, the others will be able to tell which person is causing the session to remain unencrypted. This is a departure from other mainstream technology companies, which have typically not highlighted security features for fear of provoking authorities or irritating disinterested consumers. WhatsApp appears to be betting that three years after Edward Snowden’s revelations rekindled a global debate over digital surveillance, consumers do care about data security as a deciding issue in which apps they will use. Telegram, a Berlin-based messaging service that has grown dramatically since 2013, has made similar bets as it offers privacy features. Meantime, Google and Snapchat both are exploring their own encrypted messaging services. WhatsApp and Facebook representatives did not immediately return requests for comment. WhatsApp began adding strong encryption as a default for some messages in late 2014, but it only worked for users on certain phones or in certain situations. Users also did not know if the encryption was or was not engaged, making the technology undependable for those most concerned about digital privacy, such as human rights works, dissidents and whistleblowers. WhatsApp has spent 18 months discreetly expanding encryption throughout its service. Marlinspike is a San Francisco-based developer who runs Signal, an encrypted messaging app similar to WhatsApp and popular among privacy advocates. He described the challenge as stark, being recruited to help WhatsApp’s engineering team add complicated encryption features to a service used by one billion people. The programmer said he plans to help other apps add his encryption in the future, though he declined to state who he may or may not be working with. “We’re going to keep doing stuff like this,” he said. There is also some irony in WhatsApp’s move given the current political debate. Marlinspike developed his encryption tools with a grant from Radio Free Asia, which is funded by Congress. On Monday, Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said he planned to soon unveil legislation that would regulate encrypted communications. In the blog post, Whatsapp acknowledged the recent controversy around encryption but downplayed any political implications of its most recent update. Rather, it said it was trying to protect consumers from hackers and “oppressive regimes.” “All you need to know is that end-to-end encrypted messages can only be read by the recipients you intend,” the company said. ||||| The news that Facebook’s(fb) WhatsApp now supports encryption across all its apps is nothing short of seismic. There have always been those who were keen on using encrypted communications — politicians trying to avoid the gaze of their rivals and foreign spies, corporate executives trying to protect their trade secrets, activists trying to organize opposition to oppressive regimes and, yes, criminals trying to evade law enforcement. But, in the big picture, these are fringe cases. Before Edward Snowden told the world about the extent of state surveillance in 2013, few “normal” people were interested in adding heavy protections to their communications. Soon, over a billion of them will be using this facility without even trying. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. For privacy advocates, this marks an enormous victory that few would have predicted would come so soon after Snowden’s revelations. The problem was this: Generally speaking, good end-to-end encryption, where users rather than service providers hold the keys, is a pain to use. Most people don’t adopt technologies that aren’t easy to use. Encrypted email has been around for decades, and once it is set up, it’s not that tricky. But setting it up requires a degree of technical knowledge that most people do not have. Recently, encrypted-messaging apps have made the process of protected communications much simpler. However, none of them has the immense reach of WhatsApp, and security experts are suspicious of the quality of the technology in some of them, or the fact that some default (Telegram) or occasionally switch (iMessage) to non-encrypted modes. I respect @durov, but Ptacek is right: @telegram's defaults are dangerous. Without a major update, it's unsafe. https://t.co/pbBt2rHr5x — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 19, 2015 An important factor in WhatsApp’s encryption push is the pedigree of the people behind the technology. The outfit is called Open Whisper Systems and it’s led by a very highly regarded cryptographer who uses the name “Moxie Marlinspike” and was once a key member of Twitter’s(twtr) security team (Twitter bought an earlier company of his, Whisper Systems, to beef up its own security). Open Whisper Systems created an app called Signal that provides encrypted text messaging and voice calls (functions that were originally marketed on Android as TextSecure and RedPhone respectively). It is this technology that is now incorporated into WhatsApp, across all its mobile platforms — iPhone(aapl), Android(goog), Windows Phone(msft), Nokia(nok) S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry(bbry) and BB10. The tech is state-of-the-art and uses clever tricks such as “forward secrecy” — each conversation uses a new key, so if an attacker steals the key, they cannot decrypt earlier conversations (a big problem with encrypted email). The code is open-source and has been audited. Users can even verify the security of their conversations by comparing their “security codes”. Snowden himself promotes it. All of this is now coming to a billion people’s pockets without them having to do anything about it. They don’t have to choose it — they already use WhatsApp, and this is just what the latest upgrade contains. The system will default to encryption and, once they have an encrypted conversation with someone over WhatsApp, it won’t ever fall back to non-encrypted mode. Users don’t need to consider the arguments about having “nothing to hide” and the balance between national security and privacy. They don’t need to turn to specialists with expensive secure handsets, like Silent Circle and Blackphone. This is now simply what their communications app of choice does. For more on the debate, watch: For Facebook/WhatsApp, it’s a timely move. Rivals such as Telegram, which now has 100 million users, have been gaining popularity because of their overt focus on security. WhatsApp has been offering Signal’s encryption technology to its Android users since late 2014, but on other platforms it was just regular old WhatsApp, with its biggest selling point being the fact that everyone you knew was already on it. Now there’s much less reason to look elsewhere. Interestingly, Marlinspike and his team got U.S. government funding for the development of their technology, from the same Open Technology Fund that threw cash at Tor, the anonymization tool. This fund came out of a policy, pushed by erstwhile secretary of state Hillary Clinton, to help pro-freedom activists across the world communicate without the authorities listening in. US taxpayers have spent 2.25 mil to develop the crypto used by WhatsApp. An amazing return on our investment. https://t.co/VrGK8hdSKk — Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) April 5, 2016 Ironically, this is the same Hillary Clinton who recently called for a “Manhattan-like project” to break encryption, to make sure the authorities can listen in. You can’t have trustworthy and breakable encryption at the same time and, now that the world’s biggest messaging platform has opted for trustworthiness, the debate has shifted yet again. There is still scope for spies and criminals to bypass encryption by hacking into phones and seeing what people are typing, but that’s a different matter. High-grade encryption is now the norm in app-based mobile communications, and it would be very difficult to stuff that genie back in the bottle. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service, has introduced end-to-end encryption for all communications on the latest version of its mobile app, meaning that WhatsApp will not be able to comply with court orders demanding access to the content of any messages, phone calls, photos or videos travelling through its network. The move comes in the wake of Apple's encryption battle with the FBI and could put millions more conversations outside the surveillance of authorities. For strong encryption to become available to the masses reflects an enormous victory for privacy advocates, just three years after Edward Snowden's revelations sparked the global debate over digital surveillance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Erin, on the other hand, was able to balance her busy schedule with her newfound relationship. Step 1: Identify the focus of the story. The main focus of the story is on Erin and Betty and how having a boyfriend suits Erin but not Betty due to their differing amounts of free time. Step 2: Develop the characters and their background. Erin was a student pursuing her degree, and she excelled in managing her time. She was proficient in organizing her tasks, which allowed her to maintain her studies and her relationship without feeling overwhelmed. Betty, on the other hand, worked a demanding full-time job. She was always at the office, attending meetings, and networking, leaving her little time to devote to her personal life. Step 3: Introduce a challenge or conflict. Despite their different lifestyles, Erin and Betty remained close friends. They often talked about their experiences and even discussed whether Betty should consider finding a partner amid her busy life. The challenge for Betty was figuring out if she could make room in her life for a relationship without compromising her work. Step 4: Develop the characters' responses to the conflict. Erin encouraged Betty to prioritize self-care and find a work-life balance that would allow her to have a healthy and happy personal life. She suggested ways Betty could better manage her time or look for a partner who understood her demanding schedule. Meanwhile, Betty was hesitant and unsure if she could commit to a relationship while her career stood at the forefront of her priorities. Step 5: Reach a resolution or growth for the characters. After much thought and discussion with Erin, Betty realized that perhaps it was time to reassess her priorities. She experimented with cutting back her working hours and tried a few dating apps in hopes of finding a compatible partner. The results were mixed, but the process did help Betty to start establishing a better work-life balance. In the end, both Erin and Betty learned valuable lessons about the importance of balancing their personal lives with their professional responsibilities. Through mutual support and understanding, they navigated life's challenges together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine are inhabited, including the mainland St. Vincent and the Grenadines islands: Young Island, Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Union Island, Mayreau, Petit St Vincent and Palm Island. - Station Hill is a town located on the island of Mayreau , which is part of the Grenadines island chain . - Canouan (pronounced \\"can - ah - wan\\") is an island in the Grenadines Islands belonging to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is a small island, measuring only 3.5 miles (5.6 km) by 1.25 miles (2 km). The population is about 1,700 people - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Mayreau is the smallest inhabited island of the Grenadines, with an area of about 1.5 sq. miles and a population of about 271. The population is centered in an unnamed village, located on Station Hill, a hilltop in the south-west of the island. It is an isolated community, accessible only by boat. Electricity was only recently (2002) provided by a central generator located on Saline Bay. There is a single-lane concrete road leading from the wharf on Saline Bay through the village to Saltwhistle Bay. The top of the island is crested with the small elementary school; the telecommunications building; the brick and stone Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception, christened on May 12, 1930, and a Pentecostal church. From the crest of the hill behind the Catholic Church, there is an overlook of the Tobago Cays, Canouan and Union Island. - Grenada is an island country consisting of Grenada itself and six smaller islands at the southern end of the Grenadines in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Grenada is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela, and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

It only provides information about the Duke of Edinburgh's posting in Malta during that time. To address the question properly, we need to focus on Elizabeth's residence in London after 1949. After her marriage to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1947, Princess Elizabeth and her husband initially resided at the newly built Clarence House, located in St. James's, London. The couple moved into this residence in 1949, making it the place where Elizabeth lived in London after 1949. The royal couple resided at Clarence House until her ascension to the throne in 1952, after which they moved to Buckingham Palace, the main London residence and administrative headquarters of the British Monarch. During their time at Clarence House, Elizabeth and Philip undertook numerous official duties and engagements, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, as mentioned in the statement, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in Malta for some time during their tenure at Clarence House. Elizabeth joined her husband at various points during his time in Malta, but their primary residence in London remained to be Clarence House. It is worth noting that while the Duke of Edinburgh's stationing in Malta is indeed an important aspect of their lives during this period, it does not directly answer the question about where Elizabeth lived in London after 1949.

The main institutionalised forms of recognition for those who have made a significant contribution in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, as well as for those working for peace (and more recently in the area of economics), are the Nobel prizes. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Nobel prizes are only handed out for peace\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that Nobel prizes are only handed out for peace based on the given paragraph. The paragraph clearly mentions that Nobel prizes are awarded for significant contributions in various fields, including physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and more recently, economics. The mention of peace refers to one specific category of the Nobel Prize rather than representing the entire range of awards. The Nobel Prizes, named after the Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, were established according to his will after his death in 1896. The prizes have since become some of the most prestigious awards in the world and aim to honor individuals and organizations that have made significant strides in their respective fields or have made efforts to promote peace. The prizes are intended to recognize endeavors that benefit humanity and inspire future generations to continue making positive contributions to society. The Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the field of physics. It can encompass discoveries or inventions that help advance our understanding of the physical world, from the infinitesimal scale of subatomic particles to the vast expanses of the universe. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognizes exceptional achievements in the field of chemistry, including innovations in chemical reactions, synthesis, and the discovery of new elements or compounds. This award has the potential to impact various areas of our daily lives, from medicine and technology to agriculture and environmental preservation. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is granted to individuals who have made significant discoveries or advancements in the fields of medical science or physiology. These accomplishments can influence healthcare, the treatment or prevention of diseases, and contribute to our understanding of the human body and how it functions. The Nobel Prize in Literature is given to authors, poets, and playwrights who have produced outstanding work in the realm of literature. It considers a wide variety of forms and styles, including novels, plays, essays, and poetry, with the aim of celebrating those who have enriched the world with their imagination and creativity. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to individuals and organizations that have made significant efforts to establish, promote, and maintain peace in the world. The award typically recognizes those who have advocated for peaceful resolution of conflicts, promoted human rights, provided humanitarian aid, or pursued disarmament initiatives. Lastly, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, more commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics, was added in 1968. It is given to economists who have contributed to our understanding of various economic phenomena, developed groundbreaking theories, or offered practical solutions to global economic problems. In conclusion, Nobel Prizes celebrate achievement and advancement in various fields, and peace is just one of the many categories they honor. The given paragraph does not imply that they are only handed out for peace; on the contrary, it highlights the diversity and scope of the Nobel Prizes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the farmer's market, Erin chose a lemon while Rebecca chose watermellon, because OPTIONS: [+] Erin was craving something sour. [+] Rebecca was craving something sour.","completion":"The sentence could end in either of the two ways depending on what each individual, Erin and Rebecca, was craving for. However, the different fruits chosen by the two suggest that each had their unique preferences which were dictated by their cravings at that particular time. Option 1: \\"At the farmer's market, Erin chose a lemon while Rebecca chose a watermelon, because Erin was craving something sour.\\" In this ending, it clarifies that Erin chose a lemon because she had a craving for something sour. Lemons are known for their high acidity and sour flavor that makes you pucker when you eat them. This kind of craving is significant because it drives her choice for fruit at the farmer's market, leading her to opt for a lemon rather than a different fruit. Sour cravings are not unusual, and they can be driven by various factors. For example, they could be a sign of inadequate vitamin C intake, because sour fruits like lemons are rich in this essential vitamin. Additionally, cravings can also be influenced by personal preference or mood in general. So in this case, Erin’s choice can be seen as an expression of her personal taste or a need that her physical body is communicating. Option 2: \\"At the farmer's market, Erin chose a lemon while Rebecca chose watermelon, because Rebecca was craving something sour.\\" This ending gives the impression that Rebecca’s choice of watermelon is linked to a craving for something sour. However, this may appear puzzling as watermelons are popularly known for their sweet and refreshing flavor rather than a sour taste. It's possible that particular watermelon variety could be less sweet, or that the quality of the watermelon available at the market was not optimum, causing it to taste slightly sour. Alternatively, Rebecca's palate may be unique, and what tastes sweet to others might taste sour to her. In rare instances, it could even suggest a health issue. Some medical conditions can alter the perception of taste, causing something normally sweet to taste sour. Still, this ending appears less likely considering common taste properties of the chosen fruits. Yet it is plausible if you were to factor in different perceptions, tastes, and possible health conditions. In a nutshell, both endings highlight the cravings of the characters but these cravings are associated with contrasting types of tastes; sour versus sweet. The reasons for their particular cravings are left open for interpretation and may vary from simple personal preferences to nutritional needs or potential health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me break down the answer step-by-step: 1. The Admiral Kuznetsov is a Russian aircraft carrier designed for short take-off and landing (STOVL) operations. The ship is equipped with a ski-jump ramp on the front side of the flight deck. The ski-jump ramp is an upward-curved portion of the flight deck that helps aircraft take off with a shorter runway. 2. The SU-33 is a Russian carrier-based twin-engine, heavy, all-weather fighter aircraft designed for air superiority and maritime strike missions. It has a STOVL capability, which means it can take off and land on short runways or aircraft carriers. 3. The SU-33 achieves successful short take-offs using a combination of features: a. The SU-33's powerful engines produce enough thrust for the aircraft to accelerate quickly and become airborne in a short distance. b. The aircraft carrier's flight deck has blast deflectors that can be raised behind the SU-33, which redirect the jet's exhaust in a safe manner, protecting crew and equipment on the deck. c. The aircraft's wings are designed with a high-lift configuration, providing better lift-to-drag ratio during short takeoffs. d. The ski-jump ramp on the Admiral Kuznetsov's flight deck aids the take-off process by providing an upward curve, further reducing the amount of runway needed and helping the SU-33 gain altitude more quickly. In conclusion, the Russian SU-33 is able to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov through a combination of its STOVL capability, powerful engines, high-lift wing configuration, and the ski-jump ramp on the carrier's flight deck. The provided statement addresses the disadvantages of ski-jump ramps in mixed flight deck operations with helicopters, but it does not directly explain how SU-33s are successfully launched from Admiral Kuznetsov."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

The","completion":"frustration stemming from this lack of storage capacity began to build up within me, as I contemplated the various options I could pursue in order to rectify the situation. The importance of these new files, teeming with essential information and content vital to the progress of my personal and professional projects, left me keenly aware of the urgency in finding a solution to this digital dilemma. As I weighed the different alternatives that stood before me, the thought of investing in an external hard drive crossed my mind, offering a portable yet somewhat expensive method of expanding my storage capacity. Adding more weight to this option was the growing demand for secure and reliable data backup, especially given the potentially devastating outcome of any unforeseen hardware failures or cyber threats that lurked in the modern digital world. Of course, cloud-based storage services represented another viable avenue for addressing this issue. Services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive provided not only additional storage but also the significant advantage of remote access, allowing me to retrieve my files from any internet-connected device. The convenience offered by these platforms was difficult to ignore, yet the concern of placing sensitive or confidential information in the hands of large corporations, with the subsequent risk of data breaches or privacy abuses, left me somewhat hesitant to commit fully to this option. An upgrade of my computer's internal hard drive was yet another solution worth considering, as it would result in a more seamless integration of new storage with minimal impact on my everyday computer usage. The downside of this approach lay in the necessity to either reinstall software and transfer files from the existing drive or clone its contents onto the new one, a proposition potentially mired with complications and technical hurdles. Ultimately, it was the realization that a combination of these solutions could prove to be the most effective and comprehensive approach to addressing my storage woes that led me to formulate an action plan. By investing in a dependable external hard drive for backup purposes and subscribing to a reputable cloud storage service for remote access convenience, I could ensure the security, accessibility, and expansive capacity required to accommodate my growing collection of files. This plan would be further enhanced by the future prospect of upgrading my computer's internal storage, thus affording me peace of mind and an environment conducive to the efficient management of my digital assets."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process involving an unstable isotope and its eventual decay can be broken down and explained in detail as follows: A: The isotope is unstable. Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that share the same number of protons in their atomic nucleus but have a different number of neutrons. Due to this difference in neutron count, some isotopes can be unstable. This instability arises from an imbalance between the nuclear forces that are acting on the protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. There are two fundamental forces at work within an atomic nucleus: the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. The strong nuclear force acts as a binding force between protons and neutrons, while the electromagnetic force causes repulsion between the protons because they all carry a positive charge. When there is a relative imbalance between these two forces, the nucleus may become unstable, resulting in an unstable isotope. To achieve a more stable state and minimize the energy within the nucleus, the isotope undergoes a series of transformations. These transformations occur through a process known as radioactive decay, where the unstable isotope releases energy in the form of radiation and/or atomic particles to achieve a more stable nuclear configuration. The first step in this entire process is, therefore, the existence of an unstable isotope, which sets the stage for the subsequent series of events: emission of radiation, decay, loss of atomic particles, transformation into a different element, and ultimately, the cessation of radiation emission when the isotope reaches a stable state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: how do you space things out?","completion":"To properly answer this question, I need to provide an understanding of spacing and its significance. Spacing is an essential feature in design, visual content, and written communication, that aids in enhancing clarity and improving overall aesthetics. Spacing is about organizing elements in a way that ensures balance, legibility, and the effective communication of visual or written information. There are several methods and techniques for improving spacing, and those will be the primary focus of this discussion. After a thorough analysis, I will provide a suitable recommendation for a more effective solution. Here are two possible solutions for the given goal: 1. Manual Adjustment: This method involves manually setting the amount of space between elements. This can be done through direct manipulation by dragging and dropping, adjusting line spacing, changing margins, and more. Manual adjustment typically offers excellent control over every detail of spacing, but it requires an understanding of design, composition, and typography principles. This approach may take more time, but it may provide a more tailored and precise appearance. Pros: - High level of control over precise spacing - Ability to fine-tune details for optimal presentation - Can be effective with strong design sensibilities Cons: - Time-consuming, especially for complex layouts - Requires expertise in design principles - May not yield consistent results across various platforms 2. Automatic Layout and Grid Systems: This solution relies on pre-built layout systems or grid structures that evenly distribute space between elements. Most design software and content management systems offer these features, such as Adobe InDesign's grid system or WordPress' block editor. Automatic layout systems create a consistent visual effect, facilitating both legibility and aesthetics. It is the go-to solution for beginners and designers alike, as it saves time and ensures coherency across different platforms. Pros: - Faster implementation than manual adjustment - Consistent spacing and alignments in a layout - Suitable for various levels of expertise - Ensures legibility and professional appearance - Can be customized to meet specific needs Cons: - Sometimes lacks the fine-tuning control offered by manual adjustments - May require learning new software or layout systems - Some grid systems can be inflexible or challenging to modify Considering the pros and cons for each solution, the recommended choice for efficient spacing would be using Automatic Layout and Grid Systems. This solution provides a balance between time-efficiency, consistency, and professional results, regardless of skill level. While it may have some limitations compared to manual adjustments, automatic layout systems remove a significant portion of human error and subjectivity to produce uniform, visually appealing, and easy-to-read content. Automatic layout systems are ideal for most users because they streamline the spacing process, ensuring a consistently organized layout regardless of the project's size or complexity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \\"12345678\\"or \\"QWERTY\\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \\"I don't care\\", \\"Whatever\\", \\"I love you\\" or their opposite, \\"I hate you\\". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol. Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the perfect password is easy for you and hard for others. ,,.

When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I nearly had a heart attack... I was concerned that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. I needn't have been concerned. The makers of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. That actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of \\"Strangers in a Strange Land\\" to the overall horror. Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch. Buffy actually does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. There are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to American horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed.

Question 1: How can I prepare for CAT 2017? Question 2: What should be strategy for CAT 2017?

Question 1 focuses on the preparation aspects for CAT 2017, whereas question 2 emphasizes the strategy to be implemented for CAT 2017. Let me provide detailed answers to both questions for better clarity: Question 1: How can I prepare for CAT 2017? To prepare for CAT 2017, consider the following approach: 1. Understand the CAT exam pattern and syllabus: The first step is to familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and syllabus. CAT comprises three sections: Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR), and Quantitative Aptitude (QA). Knowing the type of questions and topics will help you strategize effectively. 2. Develop a study plan: Dedicate a fixed number of hours daily to preparing for each section. Divide your available time between concept building, practice, and revision. Allocate more time to your weak areas and keep revisiting your strong areas. 3. Self-assessment: Take regular mock tests and assess your performance. Mock tests will also help you get used to the CAT exam pattern, improve your time management skills, and reduce exam anxiety. 4. Focus on building concepts: Start with basic concepts and gradually progress to more advanced topics. Use standard books and reliable online resources to enhance your conceptual knowledge. 5. Practice is the key: Spend a considerable amount of time solving problems from a wide range of difficulty levels. Practice with sectional quizzes, online timed tests, and topic-wise exercises. 6. Strengthen your vocabulary and reading skills: Read newspapers, magazines, and books to improve your vocabulary and comprehension skills. This will significantly help in the VARC section. 7. Join study groups and forums: Interacting with peers and experienced individuals can help you build your knowledge, exchange ideas, and stay motivated. 8. Keep your preparation balanced- Be consistent with your preparations and don't emphasize one section over another. Focus on each section and divide your time accordingly. Question 2: What should be the strategy for CAT 2017? Now that we've addressed preparation, let's discuss the strategy for CAT 2017: 1. Time management: Develop a time management plan for each section. Allocate a specific duration for each section depending on your proficiency and comfort level. 2. Attempt easy and moderate questions first: During the exam, focus on solving easy and moderately difficult questions before attempting the more difficult ones. This will help boost your confidence and ensure you get as many correct answers as possible from your strong areas. 3. Read questions carefully: Skim through each question carefully and understand what is being asked. This will prevent any misinterpretation and subsequent loss of marks. 4. Develop shortcuts and tricks: During your preparation, develop and learn shortcuts and tricks for faster calculations and problem-solving. 5. Stay calm and composed: Exam anxiety can be detrimental to your performance. Try to remain calm, composed, and confident throughout the examination process. 6. Flexibility: Be open to adapting your strategy during the exam if required. For example, if you are struggling with a particular section, switch to another and come back later, if time permits. 7. Review and confirm your responses: Before submitting the test, make sure to review your responses and double-check your answers, especially if there are tricky questions. Therefore, while both questions are related, question 1 specifically enquires about the process of preparing for CAT 2017, whereas question 2 aims to outline the approach to be taken while writing the actual exam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 2000 U.S. Census in the write-in response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various write-in responses for automatic placement within the framework of the U.S. Census's enumerated races. Whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races, there remains some write-in responses which fall into the \\"Mixture\\" heading which cannot be racially categorized. These include \\"Bi Racial, Combination, Everything, Many, Mixed, Multi National, Multiple, Several and Various\\". What does the \\"mixture\\" heading mean?","completion":"The \\"mixture\\" heading in the 2000 U.S. Census refers to an umbrella category used to classify write-in responses for those who feel that their racial identity does not fit within one of the five enumerated races defined by the Census Bureau. These categories are: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. The focus of this \\"mixture\\" heading is to identify and classify individuals who self-identify as being of mixed racial origin or those who feel strongly connected to more than one defined racial or ethnic group. As mentioned, common write-in responses classified under the \\"mixture\\" heading include terms such as \\"Bi Racial, Combination, Everything, Many, Mixed, Multi National, Multiple, Several, Various\\" which denote an individual's inclination to express their multi-racial or multi-ethnic background or beliefs. Such a system addresses the growing diversity and complexity of the American population by acknowledging and recognizing the various racial and ancestral combinations that constitute the United States. It is imperative to understand that the \\"mixture\\" heading in the 2000 US Census serves multiple purposes: 1. Inclusivity: By providing an option for individuals who do not fall strictly into one of the five enumerated races, the Census Bureau demonstrates an effort to be more inclusive and attentive in understanding the multifaceted racial dynamics of the U.S. population. 2. Data Collection and Analysis: Although such write-ins cannot be neatly placed into one of the main racial categories, they still offer valuable insights. The data collected can be used to identify emerging trends in the American population and can inform policymakers and researchers about shifts in racial and ethnic demographics. 3. Race and Ethnicity Consciousness: The \\"mixture\\" heading allows respondents who identify with more than one race or ethnicity to articulate and express their self-identified racial mix, enabling a more accurate representation of personal identity in the Census data. 4. Evolving Definition of Race: By capturing a wider range of racial and ethnic identities, the Census Bureau implicitly recognizes the ever-evolving meaning of race in contemporary America, where race and ethnicity are becoming more fluid and complex due to factors such as immigration and intermarriage. While the \\"mixture\\" heading in the U.S. Census's write-in responses for race seeks to encompass individuals from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds, it is important to note that this categorization method is continually reviewed and updated. Following the 2000 U.S. Census, changes were made in subsequent censuses to better handle responses pertaining to multiracial or multi-ethnic identities, further refining the measures the Census Bureau employs to ethically and accurately capture the rich tapestry of American racial and ethnic identities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of each answer Now, I will examine the potential reasons for people to board a ship: - Heading east: People may board a ship to travel in an eastward direction, either for work, leisure, trade, or exploration. - Run aground: This is not a reason for people to board a ship but rather a situation a ship might face. - Near shore: This suggests the proximity of the ship, but it does not provide a reason for people to enter the ship. - List to port: Like the \\"run aground\\" option, this describes a situation the ship may face, rather than a reason for people to board the ship. - Party: While a party could explain why people might enter a crowded ship, it only covers a single purpose and doesn't consider other potential reasons. Step 4: Choose the best answer Out of the given options, \\"heading east\\" seems like the most comprehensive and clear reason for people to go into a ship, as it suggests movement and a purpose. Conclusion: Based on the steps detailed above, \\"heading east\\" is indeed the best choice that answers the question \\"Why would people go into a ship?\\" since it implies a clear purpose for boarding (i.e., traveling eastward)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer. We usually go to Lake Arrowheads for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested us go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful. I' m sure we would enjoy a trip like that, but of course it's impossible. First, it would be rather expensive, and second, there would not be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. In fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it would be good to stay home and not to go to any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I would like to work instead of taking two weeks off: then maybe my boss would suggest that I should be given four weeks' vacation instead of two weeks.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man and a woman, both wearing hiking gear, are standing on the edge of a large canyon.\\" if \\"A man and woman are on a date at a restaurant.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not possible to directly conclude that \\"A man and a woman, both wearing hiking gear, are standing on the edge of a large canyon\\" if \\"A man and woman are on a date at a restaurant.\\" These are two separate scenarios, with different settings and activities involved. However, I will elaborate further on both scenarios to give you a better understanding of why these situations cannot be concluded from one another. In the first scenario, \\"A man and a woman, both wearing hiking gear, are standing on the edge of a large canyon,\\" there are specific details shared that help create a mental image and context. The presence of hiking gear indicates that the man and woman are likely participating in an outdoor hiking activity or adventure. The large canyon suggests the geographical feature or landmark they are exploring, and standing on its edge means they might be admiring the surrounding scenery or preparing to descend or navigate through the canyon. This scenario clearly illustrates an outdoor physical activity, with elements of nature and adventure. Hiking is the main theme here, indicating that the man and woman might share common interests in fitness and outdoor exploration. On the other hand, in the second scenario, \\"A man and woman are on a date at a restaurant,\\" we see a completely different context. Here, the focus is on a romantic or social interaction, with the setting being a restaurant. This suggests that the couple is engaging in a more typical dating experience, centered around food, conversation, and possible emotional connection. The restaurant setting gives an indication that the date would involve enjoying a meal together, discussing various topics, and getting to know each other in a more casual and comfortable environment. This scenario is more about the interpersonal relationship than any physical or adventure-related activity. In summary, the two scenarios describe distinct situations with different contexts, settings, and activities. They cannot be concluded from one another, as the first scenario revolves around outdoor hiking and the exploration of a canyon, while the second scenario takes place in a restaurant and focuses on a typical date. Although it is possible that the couple in the restaurant might, at some other time, enjoy outdoor activities together, it cannot be concluded from the specific restaurant date scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Your teacher may have given you specific requirements, and if so, you should follow those. There are two basic ways to organize a book report: Organize the book report by chapter. If you organize your book report this way, you will move from chapter to chapter. You'll probably need to cover multiple chapters in each paragraph. Pro: You can go in chronological order, which could be helpful when you're summarizing books with a lot of plot elements. Con: This kind of organization can be more difficult to figure out if you need to talk about multiple chapters in one paragraph. Organize the book report by type of element (\\"thematic\\" organization). If you organize your book report this way, you could have a paragraph about the characters, a paragraph or two about plot summary, a paragraph about main ideas, and a paragraph that sums up your opinion of the book. Pro: You can tackle a lot of plot summary in very little space. The paragraphs are clearly divided, so you know what to cover in each one. Con: This may not be appropriate if your assignment is mostly to summarize the book rather than give your opinions about it. This will help you draft your summary. Put your notes into outline form depending on how you decided to organize your paragraphs. For chronological order: Give each chapter or section of the book its own section. Write down the most important story elements and character developments that happened in each chapter. For thematic organization: Put your notes about the various elements, such as characters, plot, and main ideas, into separate sections. Each will become a paragraph. When you write your first draft, think about what elements move the story forward, because those will probably be the most important. You can give more detail as you revise, if you want. For example, many things happen in Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games, but you can't talk about them all. Instead, focus on the overall movement of the story. Begin by explaining what the Hunger Games are and how Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are chosen. Then you would summarize their time in the Capitol, including information on how sponsorship works. Following that, you would summarize the most important moments from the Games, such as Katniss injuring her leg in the fire, the attack by tracker-jackers, Rue's death, the kiss in the cave, Cato's final battle, and the decision to eat the poisonous berries. Then, you would conclude by wrapping up the most important moments from the book's ending. Your introduction should give the reader a basic idea of what the book is about. It should also give a little bit of information about its main characters and/or ideas. You don't have to go into a lot of detail here; you just need to give enough information that your reader knows what to expect from the rest of the report. Give publication information for the book, including the book's title, author, year of publication, and genre. Your teacher may ask you to include other information. If your book was written by someone important, won an award, or is a best-seller, give that information too. For example, a short overall summary of Lois Lowry's The Giver might look something like this: “Lois Lowry's young-adult novel The Giver was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 1993, and it won a Newbery Medal in 1994. It is set in what appears to be a utopian society that thrives on 'Sameness.' There is no hunger, sadness, or poverty in this society. However, this utopia depends on keeping its people from feeling true emotions. This lack of emotion causes serious issues for the main character, Jonas, once he is chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory.” For a nonfiction book, summarize the author's main idea or purpose for writing the book. State what you think their thesis is. For example, a short overall summary for the book I Am Malala might look like this: “The youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Malala Yousafzai tells her incredible true story in I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. This book was published by Little, Brown and Company in 2013. Malala wants to inspire other young people to believe in their power to change the world by sharing her own experience about the value of education and peaceful protest.” Working from your outline, develop body paragraphs that summarize the most important elements of the book. Unless you're dealing with a very short book, you almost certainly won't be able to summarize every detail or even every chapter in your final draft. Instead, focus on what seemed most important to you about the story and the characters. For nonfiction, your summary should focus on what you think the author's main idea is and how that idea is developed in the book. What important points does the author make? What evidence or stories from their personal experience do they use to support their points? If you've chosen to organize your book report chronologically, think about how the plot moves along. What are the major events in the plot? Where do things change? Where are the surprises or cliff-hangers? Break up your paragraphs based on where the important events happen. For example, if you were summarizing J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit, you might organize your paragraphs this way: Introductory paragraph: summarize the book in general and gives the publication information. Body paragraph 1: summarize Gandalf's plot to get Bilbo Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin Oakenshield and the party of Dwarves. End with Bilbo's choosing to go on an adventure (because this is a major changing point for the character). Body paragraph 2: summarize the adventures Bilbo and the Dwarves have, such as almost being eaten by trolls, getting kidnapped by goblins, and Bilbo finding Gollum and the One Ring. There are a lot of adventures, so you wouldn't talk about them all; instead, pick the most important points. You might end with the Dwarves being captured by the Wood-Elves, because this is another \\"turning point\\" in the story. Bilbo has to decide whether he is brave enough to rescue everyone. Body paragraph 3: summarize the interactions between the Dwarves and the Lake Town people, Bilbo getting into the Lonely Mountain and talking to Smaug, Smaug destroying everything and getting killed (spoiler!), and the many groups of Dwarves, Elves, and Men deciding to fight over the spoils. This is a good place to stop this paragraph, because it's the climax of the story and your reader wants to know the resolution, or how everything turns out okay. Body paragraph 4: summarize how Bilbo tries to stop the fighting, the argument Bilbo and Thorin have, the outcome of the battle, and Bilbo coming home to discover all of his stuff is being sold off. You can also talk about how the main character, Bilbo, ends up as a different character than the way he started off. That would be a good transition into... Conclusion paragraph: talk about the main ideas of the book and what you learned. You might talk about how important it is to learn to be brave, or how greed is criticized in the book. Then, wrap up with your opinion about the book overall. Would you recommend it to a friend? If you've chosen thematic organization, you can develop your paragraphs according to topic instead of letting the plot determine your paragraphs. You'll want a paragraph (or two) of plot summary, a paragraph about the characters, a paragraph about the book's main ideas or themes, and a paragraph that sums up your overall opinion. Begin with a VERY brief plot summary. Talk about the type of book it is, where the book is set (Hogwarts, outer space, a mythical past), what the main character is trying to do or learn, and how the plot ends up. The paragraph about characters should talk about the main character (or characters). Who are they, and why are they important? What do they want to do or learn? What flaws and strengths do they have? Do they end the book as different in some way than how they began?For example, a paragraph about the characters in The Hobbit would probably focus the most on Bilbo Baggins, the \\"protagonist\\" or hero of the novel. It would probably also need to talk a little bit about the other important characters: Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the wizard. This paragraph would consider Bilbo's character development from someone who starts off afraid of new things to someone who ends up being brave and saving his friends. The paragraph about the main ideas or themes might be the hardest one to write, but your notes should help. Think about what lessons the characters have learned. What did this book make you think about? Did it make you ask questions? For example, if you were writing about The Giver, you might want to discuss the importance of feelings in human lives. You could also talk about the idea that in order to experience life fully, you have to experience pain as well as pleasure. Another big theme is the idea of becoming your own person: the hero Jonas has to learn how to reject the \\"Sameness\\" of society to follow his own path. Your conclusion should wrap up by reviewing the main points of the book and giving your opinion of the book. Did you like it? Was it enjoyable? Do you agree with the author's ideas or ways of writing? Did you learn something you didn't know before? Explain your reasons for your reaction, using examples to support your claims. Imagine your conclusion as a way of telling others whether they should read the book or not. Would they enjoy it? Should they read it? Why or why not?","completion":"The article outlines two basic ways to organize a book report: organizing it by chapter (chronological order) or by the type of element (thematic organization).

The primary focus is on the dissatisfaction with the food quality, slow service, and limited beer options, reflecting the negative sentiment. The reviewer found the hot wings and fries to be average and unimpressive, highlighting disappointment in their dining experience. The service aspect adds to the negative sentiment, as the reviewer communicates frustration over having to take their tab and find the waitress to cash out. This level of inconvenience indicates dissatisfaction with the attentiveness and efficiency of the staff in handling customer needs. Furthermore, the lack of diverse beer options, with only Miller and Coors on tap, is another point of discontent for the reviewer. This limited selection creates a sense of disappointment for customers who expect a broader range of alcoholic beverages. However, there are a couple of slightly positive elements present in the review. The mention of drinks and bottled beer being generally satisfactory somewhat mitigates the negativity, but it is not enough to offset the overall tone of dissatisfaction.

Process: - Owls have specially adapted eyes that see better at night - Owls sit at high points in trees and look around - When an owl spots a rodent they track it - When the rodent is standing still the owl swoops down - The owl grabs the rodent with their tallons - The owl uses their beak to eat the rodent. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the soil is polluted happens, how will it affect trees will be shorter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If the soil is polluted, this can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process involving owls hunting rodents. Direct effects on the process due to soil pollution: 1. If soil pollution causes trees to be shorter, it will impact the owls' hunting strategies. Owls perch at high points in trees to scan for prey; shorter trees may make it more difficult for them to spot potential prey from an elevated vantage point. 2. Soil pollution can lead to a reduction in vegetation growth, which can result in lower levels of biodiversity in the ecosystem. A reduced plant biodiversity can negatively impact the availability of hiding spots and food for rodents, leading to a decline in their population. This can pose a challenge for owls, as there will be a lower number of prey for them to hunt. 3. Soil pollution can also have detrimental effects on the health of trees within the area, making them more prone to diseases or even death. This can lead to a decline in the number of suitable perching spots available to owls. Indirect effects on the process due to soil pollution: 1. If soil pollution leads to the death of trees and a decline in vegetation, other predators and competitors of owls may also experience a decline in available food sources. This can potentially lead to increased competition among predators, forcing owls to adapt their hunting strategies or relocate to an environment that is more conducive to their hunting needs. 2. Soil pollution can also negatively impact the population dynamics of rodents, as well as their behavior and physiology. Pollutants in the soil may enter the food chain, affecting the health and reproductive success of rodents and leading to a decline in their population. This can have a downstream effect on owls, as there will be fewer prey available for them to hunt. Additionally, soil pollution may cause rodents to exhibit altered behavior or avoid certain habitats, making them more difficult for owls to locate and catch. 3. If the decrease in suitable tree perching locations causes owls to move closer to human populations, this could potentially lead to an increase in human-wildlife conflicts, such as predation on domestic animals. This may then result in a negative perception of owls by humans, potentially leading to actions (such as hunting, disturbing nesting sites, or destroying habitat) that further exacerbate the challenges faced by owls in a polluted environment. In summary, soil pollution has the potential to have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls and their prey, mainly through the reduction of suitable perching spots for hunting and the decline in rodent populations. Owls may need to adapt their hunting strategies or relocate to less polluted areas in order to cope with these changes in their environment."},{"prompt":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music? Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The water will turn into water vapor - Collect the water vapor - Allow the water vapor to cool - The water vapor will turn into liquid water - The salt will be separated from the water. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is heating the salt-water mixture. The entire process can be described as a simple distillation method used to separate salt from water, which involves the following steps: 1. Heat the salt-water mixture: The first step in this process is heating the salt-water mixture to increase the water's temperature. This can be done using a heat source like a stove or a Bunsen burner. Place the mixture in a container made from heat-resistant material, such as a glass beaker or a metal pot. Gradually increase the temperature until the water starts boiling. 2. The water will turn into water vapor: As the salt-water mixture is heated, the water molecules gain energy and begin to move faster. Eventually, they reach the boiling point and transform from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, creating water vapor. The salt particles, being non-volatile, do not evaporate and remain in the container. 3. Collect the water vapor: To collect the water vapor, a condensation apparatus is required. This typically consists of a cooling system such as a condenser or a coiled tube, which allows the passage of a cold fluid (water or air) around the tube where the water vapor flows. The water vapor passes through the tube, leaving the salt behind in the original container. 4. Allow the water vapor to cool: As the water vapor comes into contact with the cold surface of the condenser or coils, it loses energy, causing the temperature to drop. The cooling process facilitates condensation – the change of phase from the gaseous state back to the liquid state. 5. The water vapor will turn into liquid water: When the water vapor cools down sufficiently, it condenses back into liquid water, leaving the gaseous state. The liquid water is collected in a separate container, like a flask, while leaving the salt behind in the initial container. 6. The salt will be separated from the water: After the distillation process is complete, the two components of the initial salt-water mixture, the solid salt, and the liquid water, are now separated. The salt remains in the original container as the water evaporates, and the evaporated water is collected in a separate container. This produces purified water that is free from dissolved salt and other impurities. In summary, the missing first step in this process is heating the salt-water mixture. Once the mixture is heated, it initiates a series of reactions that ultimately lead to the separation of salt from the water through evaporation, condensation, and collection of the purified water in a separate container."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

During the procedure itself, trust the transplant team to do their job. You can help by ensuring that all of the recipient's medical records and insurance information are ready for the hospital's consideration.","completion":"After the surgery, your loved one will require constant care and support, both physical and emotional, as they undergo the recovery process. Here are some ways you can assist in the post-transplant period: 1. Monitor the medication regimen: One of the most crucial aspects of recovery is ensuring that the recipient takes their prescribed medications on time and according to the doctor's instructions. These medications prevent organ rejection and help maintain their overall health. Develop a system for tracking their dosages and daily routines, including any potential side effects or health concerns to consult with the healthcare team. 2. Attend follow-up appointments: Accompany the transplant recipient to their follow-up appointments and help them keep track of important dates and recommendations. Be an active listener and advocate during these visits, taking notes and asking relevant questions regarding their recovery and long-term care. 3. Monitor and maintain hygiene: Encourage and help them maintain good hygiene practices, as proper hygiene reduces the risk of infection. This might include providing assistance with bathing, dressing changes, and daily cleanliness routines. 4. Encourage a healthy diet: Help the kidney transplant recipient establish and follow a diet that meets their specific nutritional requirements for optimal healing. This may include a balance between protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, as well as monitoring their fluid intake to ensure proper kidney function. 5. Facilitate regular exercise: As their energy levels improve, encourage the recipient to engage in light physical activities, such as walking, stretching, or gentle yoga. Regular exercise is essential for overall well-being and can help stimulate circulation, build strength, and improve mental health. Always consult with the healthcare team before beginning a new exercise routine. 6. Provide emotional support: The emotional aspects of recovery should not be underestimated. Be there for the kidney transplant recipient by encouraging open communication, offering reassurance, and listening to their feelings and concerns about the process. Encourage them to share their emotions and seek additional support from mental health professionals if needed. 7. Organize and maintain a support network: Reach out to friends, family, and other supportive individuals in the recipient's life to create a network of assistance. Coordinate schedules to ensure that everyone is able to contribute to their recovery and day-to-day needs, such as grocery shopping, transportation to appointments, or help with household chores. 8. Assist with daily tasks: Depending on the kidney transplant recipient's level of independence and mobility, they may require assistance with various everyday tasks. Helping them with chores, meal preparation, and administrative tasks like bill payments can reduce their stress and aid in their recovery journey. 9. Educate yourself about transplantation and kidney care: As a caregiver and supportive figure, it's essential to understand the kidney transplant process, potential complications, and long-term care requirements. The more informed you are, the better you can support the recipient and provide the care they need. 10. Celebrate milestones and recognize progress: Recovery can be a challenging and slow journey for many kidney transplant recipients. Acknowledge their hard work and perseverance by celebrating the small victories they achieve. Positive reinforcement and encouragement can make a significant difference in their emotional well-being and motivation. By implementing these strategies, you can assist a kidney transplant recipient in their recovery and help them navigate the various challenges and adjustments they may encounter. Being a dedicated and compassionate support system is an essential part of ensuring a successful and smooth recovery process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Burmese too had begun to assemble their invasion force, starting during their new year celebrations in April 1759, gathering troops from all over Upper Burma, including from recently conquered northern Shan States and Manipur. By late 1759, Alaungpaya had massed a force of 40 regiments at Yangon. Of the 3000 cavalry, 2000 were Manipuri \\"Cassay Horse\\", who had just been press-ganged into Alaungpaya's service after the Burmese conquest of Manipur in 1758. The Burmese battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along the Three Pagodas Pass-Ayutthaya corridor. They selected a longer but less defended route: Go south to Tenasserim, cross the Tenasserim Hills over to Gulf of Siam, and turn north to Ayutthaya. To that end, the Burmese had assembled a fleet of 300 ships to transport a portion of their troops directly to the Tenasserim coast. Alaungpaya was to lead the invasion personally, and his second son Hsinbyushin was his second-in-command. His first son Naungdawgyi was left to administer the country. Also in his service were his top generals including the likes of Minkhaung Nawrahta who like all Burmese leadership had plenty of military experience.

The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Ellie witnesses a man being executed with a shot to the head, and in her horror retreats too quickly, being spotted by a searchlight. They flee but are pursued by soldiers into the backyard of a house. Ellie, using Kevin's singlet, lighter and the fuel tank of a ride-on lawn mower, creates an explosion that eliminates the squad.On return to Corrie's house, they find that Lee and Robyn are missing. Ellie and Corrie witness an RAAF jet fighter being shot down by enemy aircraft. Whilst the group gathers inside to plan for their return to Hell, an enemy helicopter performs a close examination of the house.

Question: where is the largest ice sheet in the north Context: Glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers. Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice tongue, like Mertz Glacier.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at a campaign event with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Janesville, Wis. (AP) Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, one of the party’s young conservative stars, said Monday he won’t run for president in 2016. The 44-year-old Ryan was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2012. His announcement comes just a few days after his then-presidential running mate, Mitt Romney, said he is considering a 2016 White House bid. Ryan is the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, trade, Social Security and health care. He said Monday that he wants to focus on his work in Congress and that running the committee will require his undivided attention. \\"Our work … over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward,” Ryan said. \\"It's clear our country needs a change in direction. And our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative. So I'm going to do what I can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory.\\" Ryan, when chairman of the House Budget Committee, became a favorite among conservatives for developing detailed plans for reining in federal spending. However, those plans have also made him a villain among many Democrats and liberal groups. The Democratic National Committee said after Ryan’s announcement that he might be out of the running but his policy ideas live with such 2016 GOP White House hopefuls as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. “Even as Ryan removes himself from the primary race, the dangerous ideas in his budget plan will live on through each of the other potential GOP 2016 candidates,” the group said.

Lord Turnbull said he could not grant an order against the camp until he was satisfied it was proportionate. He ordered a hearing to \\"identify the scope of further procedure\\". The camp was set up in late November by independence activists, who said they intended to stay in place until Scotland was declared independent. The Scottish Parliament took legal action to oust them, arguing that they were camping without permission, taking up space which could be used by others, and potentially risking the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate. In a lengthy legal argument in March, camp representatives put forward arguments for why they should stay based on the 1707 Treaty of Union and the Declaration of Arbroath. In his written judgement, Lord Turnbull said these arguments had \\"no legal foundation\\" but also said he did not consider that the camp posed a security risk or was \\"inhibiting\\" the use of the parliamentary estate by others. The judge said he could not find in favour of the parliament until he was satisfied that an eviction order was proportionate. He said: \\"The question of the proportionality of granting the order has been raised, in oral submissions at least, and in my judgement this is sufficient in the circumstances to bar me from granting the order sought until satisfied on this manner. \\"I will therefore refuse to grant the prayer of the petition...and I will make an order requiring the case to call at a procedural hearing in order to identify the scope of further procedure.\\" He added: \\"The proportionality of granting the order sought by the petitioner is not something which has been closely focused on by the respondents to date. They no doubt directed their attentions to what seemed to them to be the grand or more interesting arguments, as influenced by their underlying political views. \\"In my opinion, none of these arguments had any validity.\\" Lord Turnbull went on to say that he anticipated a hearing would be fixed where the parliament and the camp could present witnesses and evidence to support their respective cases. A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: \\"We welcome Lord Turnbull's opinion today which recognises that the protesters camp constitutes trespass and an encroachment on parliament land, and that the parliament may seek an order for the removal of a trespasser who refuses to leave. \\"Today's opinion provides a positive step forward in the resolution of the issue and we are happy to comply with Lord Turnbull's request for information on the sole remaining issue of proportionality.\\" .

Article: Throughout time, people have loved music for its ability to transport them into a world of rhythm and melody. Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . After each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. Therapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . Music therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. Jose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. \\"I was searching for my pain.\\" He says of his experience, \\"but it was gone.\\" While Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. In addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. Even perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms.

Girls are more likely to talk to a guy if they are not complete strangers. Catch her eye in class and smile, nod at her in the school hallways, or make an effort to sit near her at lunch.","completion":"The most logical next event after becoming familiar with the girl and getting her to notice you would be engaging her in conversation. This will help build a deeper connection and provide opportunities for you both to learn more about each other's likes, dislikes, and interests. Here is a step-by-step approach to engaging a girl in conversation after making yourself familiar to her: 1. Find the right time and place: Look for an appropriate time and setting to initiate conversation. Ideally, choose a moment when she seems receptive and relaxed, such as during a break between classes, during lunch, or after school. Avoid approaching her when she is busy, stressed, or with a large group of friends, as this may make her feel uncomfortable or pressured. 2. Approach her confidently: Confidence is attractive, so maintain good posture, make eye contact, and smile as you approach her. This will signal to her that you are friendly and genuinely interested in getting to know her. 3. Use open-ended questions: The key to engaging someone in conversation is to ask open-ended questions that cannot be answered with just a 'yes' or 'no.' This encourages the person to share more information and keeps the conversation flowing. For example, instead of asking \\"Do you like this class?\\", try asking \\"What do you think about this class?\\" or \\"How do you feel about the subject?\\" 4. Listen actively: When she speaks, pay close attention to what she is saying and respond thoughtfully to show that you are genuinely interested in her thoughts and feelings. Listening actively not only demonstrates respect but also helps you gather information that can be used to further the conversation and ask more in-depth questions. 5. Share information about yourself: Opening up about yourself is essential to building a connection. Share some personal stories or anecdotes that relate to the conversation, but be careful not to dominate the discussion. 6. Find common ground: Discovering shared interests, values, or experiences can help create a bond and provide more topics for conversation. If you come across a common interest during the conversation, delve deeper into that subject to keep the conversation engaging and interesting. 7. Be respectful and considerate: Treat her with kindness and respect throughout the conversation. Avoid interrupting and making inappropriate comments or jokes. Additionally, be attentive to her body language and verbal cues, as these can indicate whether she is enjoying the conversation or feeling uncomfortable. 8. Know when to end the conversation: A good conversation should leave both parties wanting more. Therefore, it's essential to recognize when a conversation has run its course or if she seems to be in a hurry or disinterested. When it's time to end the conversation, do so gracefully by thanking her for her time and expressing interest in continuing the conversation in the future. 9. Follow up: If the conversation went well, consider following up with her at a later time to show that you are still interested in getting to know her better. This could be via a text, a message on social media, or another in-person conversation. By taking this approach to engage a girl in conversation after becoming familiar with her and getting her to notice you, you will be well on your way to developing a strong connection and potentially forming a meaningful relationship. Remember to be yourself, and let the conversation flow naturally, as authenticity and honesty are the cornerstones of any successful relationship."},{"prompt":"This article: The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I read this background article the other day: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. I am facing a new situation today: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which camera would have higher beam quality?

Answer the following question: I can use this background: There is worldwide concern about the relationship between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues. Electrochemical processes are at the heart of these new technologies. Now, I have a new situation: Two countries used different fuels as power sources for their activities. Alsacia used fossil fuels, while Lorena devised more advanced energy storage devices, therefore relying on electricity. Answer this question please: Which country contributed less to the irreversible damage our environment? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background provided, it is clear that Lorena contributed less to the irreversible damage of our environment. There are several reasons for this conclusion, which are detailed below. 1. Use of Fossil Fuels vs. Advanced Energy Storage Devices: Alsacia used fossil fuels as their primary power source, which are known to release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere during their combustion in vehicles and power plants. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures and climate change. This increased warming contributes to extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other environmental damages. In contrast, Lorena relied on electricity generated by advanced energy storage devices. These devices typically store energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, which produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during electricity generation. By using these advanced energy storage technologies, Lorena significantly reduced their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the associated environmental damage. 2. Finite Resources and Sustainable Development: Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources, meaning that they cannot be replenished within a human timescale. Continued reliance on these finite resources can lead to resource depletion and geopolitical conflicts over access. As fossil fuel reserves become more scarce, extraction methods also become more environmentally damaging, exacerbating the negative impacts on the environment. On the other hand, advanced energy storage devices can store and distribute energy from renewable sources, which are virtually inexhaustible. This sustainable energy strategy ensures that future generations will continue to have access to clean, abundant energy without depleting the earth's natural resources. 3. Encouraging Technological Advancements: Lorena's investment in advanced energy storage devices indicates that they are pursuing innovative solutions to tackle the global challenge of climate change. By promoting research and development in this field, Lorena helps drive improvements in energy storage technologies, making them more accessible, affordable, and efficient. In turn, this contributes to the global effort in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. In conclusion, Lorena's reliance on electricity generated by advanced energy storage devices significantly reduced their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the associated irreversible damage to our environment. By embracing innovative and sustainable energy solutions, Lorena is better-positioned to address the global challenges posed by climate change and the depletion of non-renewable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men (out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000) during the reign of Antiochos III. The rest of the army was made up of native troops. Antiochus III the great conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of Seleucus I. After being defeated by Ptolemy IV's forces at Raphia (217), Antiochus III led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces (212-205) including Bactria, Parthia, Ariana, Sogdiana, Gedrosia and Drangiana. He was successful, bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers. After the death of Ptolemy IV (204), Antiochus took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to conquer Coele-Syria in the fifth Syrian war (202-195). He then began expanding his influence into Pergamene territory in Asia and crossed into Europe, fortifying Lysimachia on the hellespont, but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BCE). In the Treaty of Apamea which ended the war, Antiochus lost all of his territories in Anatolia west of the Taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents. Q: Who defeated Antiochus III at Raphia?","completion":"Antiochus III was defeated by Ptolemy IV's forces at the Battle of Raphia in 217 BCE. Ptolemy IV was the Pharaoh of Egypt at that time, and his victory over Antiochus III helped maintain Egyptian control over Coele-Syria.

Please answer the following question: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects? Hint: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. Answer:","completion":"Jill had a field that attracted fewer insects. This is because her plants relied on wind-spread pollen for fertilization, whereas Joy's flowering plants evolved traits, such as brightly colored petals, to attract insects for pollination and offered nectar in exchange. Insects play a crucial role in the fertilization process for Joy's plants, making her field more attractive to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

No. The statement provided discusses the impact of contraception on various aspects of society, including women's lifestyle choices and changing social norms. However, it does not specifically contain the correct answer to the question, \\"Discussing contraception sometimes led to prosecution under what laws?\\" To answer that question, we must look into the historical context surrounding the discussion of contraception and the laws that wielded influence over those discussions. In the United States, the Comstock Act of 1873 was a federal law that made it illegal to send any \\"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\\" materials through the mail—including information pertaining to contraceptive methods. The Act also prohibited the distribution of any related materials or devices and extended to discussions about abortion. Several states in the U.S. enacted their own laws modeled after the Comstock Act, further restricting access to and discussion of contraception. The Comstock Act significantly affected the dissemination of information about contraception, as individuals advocating for reproductive rights sometimes faced prosecution under these laws. It was not until the early 20th century, with the efforts of activists such as Margaret Sanger, that the movement to repeal and challenge these laws began to gain traction. Significant legal cases, like the 1918 case People v. Sanger, which led to a reinterpretation of the New York Comstock Law, and the 1936 case United States v. One Package, which further weakened the Comstock Act—both played crucial roles in laying the groundwork for expanded access to contraceptives. The social and legal landscape surrounding contraception continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, with other landmark decisions like Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965. This case struck down state laws prohibiting the use of contraceptives by married couples and recognized a constitutional right to privacy that included contraceptive use. This right was later extended to unmarried individuals through the 1972 case Eisenstadt v. Baird. In summary, the statement provided does not answer the question about the laws under which discussing contraception sometimes led to prosecution. The correct answer to that question would refer to the Comstock Act of 1873 and similar state laws which criminalized the distribution and discussion of contraception."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: General Sir David Richards, Chief of. the Defence Staff, also pays token rent on apartment at Kensington Palace - at yearly cost of around £256,000 to taxpayer. By. Mark Nicol and Nick Craven. PUBLISHED:. 19:17 EST, 15 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 06:01 EST, 20 June 2013. Head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, is paid £180,000 and has a. flat in London as his official residence. Britain’s military top brass should sacrifice their ‘lavish lifestyles’ and move into council flats, a former government economist has said. In an attack on the ‘grotesque’ culture of grace-and-favour privileges enjoyed by senior officers – including heavily subsidised luxury apartments – the former Chief Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Defence says up to £1 billion can be saved. This could be done by cutting ‘questionable’ allowances to senior officers, axeing up to one in three posts above the rank of brigadier (or equivalent) and by procuring new aircraft carriers and submarines more efficiently. Neil Davies, who retired last year, rubbished suggestions by the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, that any further cuts to the £34billion defence budget would jeopardise Britain’s ability to win wars. Mr Davies said: ‘Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? As the head of the Army, General Wall is paid £180,000 and has a flat as his official residence. 'This is a lavish lifestyle and it is shared by a number of very senior officers in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. 'Senior officers say they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they can be summoned to advise the Prime Minister at any time. 'In that case they could be found a council flat in Vauxhall – the point being that other properties could fill the same geographic criteria. General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, pays a. token rent on Princess Diana's former apartment in Kensington Palace and. can live there with his wife Caroline (above) for the duration of his. time in office. The property reportedly costs the taxpayer £256,000 a. year to run. Favours: General Sir David Richards (circled left) and General Sir Peter Wall (circled right), with the Queen and the military top brass at the Armed Forces Parade and Muster in Home Park, Windsor, last year. ‘At the same time, many junior ranks’ accommodation resembles council estates. Some of these flats and houses are abysmal and the comparison between the treatment of those at the top and bottom ends of the Armed Forces is grotesque.’ General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, pays a token rent on Princess Diana’s former apartment in Kensington Palace and can live there with his wife Caroline for the duration of his time in office. The property reportedly costs the taxpayer £256,000 a year to run. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas – the most senior officer in the Royal Navy – has a luxury apartment in Admiralty Arch, just off Trafalgar Square. Remarkably, none of these Service chiefs is reported to pay more than £750 a month to rent these properties, and there are many other such officers in luxury properties. They may also claim for domestic assistance and some enjoy the services of personal chefs and drivers. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Davies described visiting an eight-bedroom house at the Royal Naval base in Devonport, Plymouth, which was maintained for entertaining guests by the Rear Admiral commanding ‘FOST’ – the Flag Officer Sea Training establishment. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas - the most senior officer in the Royal Navy - has a luxury apartment in Admiralty Arch, just off Trafalgar Square. He said it was fitted out with antiques and grand paintings like a country hotel, all at public expense. ‘The Rear Admiral admitted he and his wife hadn’t liked living there so they had moved to a much smaller place nearby, but their huge house was maintained for guests of FOST,’ he said. ‘What we have is a relic of the 1920s class system in the Armed Forces that is perpetuated through a package of privileges and remuneration to senior officers which they couldn’t maintain in civilian life and is denied even to senior officials in the diplomatic service.’ Mr Davies also said many of these officers were doing little more than ‘manning desks’ in Whitehall and that one in three could be removed from the command chain without remotely damaging Britain’s chances of winning future wars. He said: ‘All three Services are top-heavy with senior officers, even in comparison to the US military, which is hardly an example of efficiency. Many are replicating each other’s jobs. ‘We would be better off amalgamating the three Services at the level of high-ranking commanders to end this duplication. This would mean the Armed Forces wouldn’t need to retain and promote so many officers in order to compete for the top jobs.’ The MoD's ex-Chief Economic Adviser, Neil Davies, said: 'Senior officers say. they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they. can be summoned to advise the PM at any time. In that case they could. be found a council flat in Vauxhall'. Above, Kensington Palace. Mr Davies said politicians and civilian officials were reluctant to challenge the generals and admirals over their packages because they would have to put their own pay deals and perks under similar scrutiny. ‘At the end of the last Labour government a report was commissioned into these privileges. It was intended to highlight the cost of official residences and vehicles and the lifestyles but it was never published and effectively buried,’ he said. On procurement, Mr Davies suggested the MoD was restricted by its relationship with the British defence industry, with companies such as BAE Systems enjoying a ‘feather-bedded monopoly’. ‘BAE won a contract to build the Astute attack-class submarines after offering a price that it simply could not afford. So it went cap in hand to the MoD claiming that it would have to default on the order unless the MoD coughed up more money. BAE are untouchable.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Senior ranks do not just fulfil command positions in the three services, they also hold senior management roles . . . as well as positions in UK embassies, NATO and other coalition headquarters around the world.’ ... as No. 10 goes to war on 'luxury' Army budget. Britain can no longer expect to punch ‘way above its weight’ on military spending, David Cameron has told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. The warning comes as the MoD fights to avoid deep cuts in this month’s spending review. Mr Hammond has angered No10 by refusing to sign up to any reductions that might damage frontline capabilities. Britain can no longer expect to punch 'way above its weight' on military spending, David Cameron has told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (right) But he has been warned in stark terms by Mr Cameron that the MoD’s £34 billion budget should be regarded as generous because it is the fourth largest in the world – even though the UK economy is only sixth. The French, who are sixth in the defence pecking order, spend £8 billion less than the British. America accounts for 40 per cent of global defence spending with an annual £436 billion budget. China is second, with £106 billion, while Russia is third on £57 billion. Mr Cameron said that the Chancellor is demanding ‘just’ £1.6 billion to be trimmed from the MoD. Mr Hammond responded by saying he would try to find ‘efficiency savings’ but would not slash deep into manpower or equipment budgets. The exchanges between Mr Cameron and Mr Hammond took place as negotiations continue between the MoD and the Treasury ahead of the spending review on June 26. A Whitehall source said: ‘Mr Cameron is proud of that fact we have such powerful, well-resourced Armed Forces. But he wanted Philip to be aware that it is something of a luxury when there is a such a pressing need to trim spending.’ The MoD has been at the centre of some of the most public, and acrimonious, exchanges about the spending review, with the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, warning that cuts could endanger soldiers’ lives. Sir Peter argued it would be dangerous to lose more troops when the Army is already being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel. ‘Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive,’ he said. An earlier version of this article said General Sir Peter Wall had an apartment at Kensington Palace. In fact his Army accommodation in London is at a different location. Nor does he have a country residence as was stated. We apologise for these inaccuracies.","completion":"Here's the story for you, buddy!

Article: Fitness Trackers: Good at Measuring Heart Rate, Not So Good At Measuring Calories Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine Sleek, high-tech wristbands are extremely popular these days, promising to measure heart rate, steps taken during the day, sleep, calories burned and even stress. And, increasingly, patients are heading to the doctor armed with reams of data gathered from their devices. \\"They're essentially asking us to digest the data and offer advice about how to avoid cardiovascular disease,\\" says cardiologist Euan Ashley, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center and Stanford Hospital and Clinics in northern California. And, being somewhat near Silicon Valley, he says he gets a lot of tech-savvy patients bringing fitness-tracker data to appointments. The problem, he says, is that he just didn't know how reliable that data was. So, he and colleagues decided to study seven of the most popular devices and compare their accuracy to the gold-standard tests that doctor's use. They looked at two metrics: heart rate and calories burned. For heart rate, the fitness trackers were compared to findings from an electro-cardiogram, or EKG. It turned out the devices were \\"surprisingly accurate\\", says Ashley. \\"Most devices most of the time were 'off' by only about 5 percent.\\" However, when it came to measuring how many calories a person burned, the findings were way off, says Ashley, showing a degree of inaccuracy that ranged from 20 percent to 93 percent, meaning 93 percent of the time the worst-performing device was wrong. Researchers compared the findings of the wrist devices to a sophisticated system of calculating metabolism which measures oxygen and carbon dioxide in people's breath. \\"This is a very well-designed and well-done study,\\" says Dr. Tim Church, a professor of preventative medicine at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University who was not involved in the study. Church routinely consults with companies about how to introduce wellness strategies into the workplace. Being wrong 93 percent of the time means the findings from the fitness tracker are more \\"fiction than fact,\\" he says, which can actually undermine a healthy diet. \\"It's just human nature. People are checking these inaccurate counts and they think they've earned a muffin or earned some ice cream and they're sabotaging their weight-loss program.\\" Church points to a study last year which found participants in a weight-loss program who also wore fitness trackers actually lost less weight than participants who didn't wear the trackers. \\"It's an instance of no information is probably better than having bad information,\\" he says. The Stanford study was published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine. It was relatively small, with 29 men and 31 women. In addition to the primary results, there were some other interesting findings. In certain groups of people — for example, those with darker skin, higher BMIs and men — the error made by devices was actually greater than for Caucasian women with a more healthy weight. Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine \\"So, for those for whom it might matter the most, who are trying to lose weight, the error was actually greater,\\" says Ashley, who doesn't know why this may be the case. He speculates that it could be that companies use a fairly narrow group of people for testing the equations they use to measure heart rate and calories burned. The study didn't look at how well devices count steps or monitor sleep or stress. The take-home message, says Ashley, is to not rely on the devices to measure total calories burned. Instead focus on eating what we know is a healthy diet, which is low in sugar and high in fiber, and to \\"eat not until you're full but until you're no longer hungry.\\" And, of course, people should exercise, he says, adding, \\"we have no more important intervention than exercise for the prevention of any number of diseases.\\" Makers of two devices, Fitbit and PulseOn say they remain confident in the performance of the trackers both in measuring heart rate and calories burned. In a statement, PulseOn questioned the study's methodology, saying that the high errors for calorie measurements \\"suggest that the authors may not have properly set all the user parameters on the device.\\" Mark Gorelick, the chief science officer at the device-maker Mio Global, says, \\"we agree that more accurate calorie estimation is important for the industry as a whole, since most individuals are monitoring calorie deficits for weight loss.\\" The other device makers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ||||| Abstract http://precision.stanford.edu/ The ability to measure physical activity through wrist-worn devices provides an opportunity for cardiovascular medicine. However, the accuracy of commercial devices is largely unknown. The aim of this work is to assess the accuracy of seven commercially available wrist-worn devices in estimating heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and to propose a wearable sensor evaluation framework. We evaluated the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2. Participants wore devices while being simultaneously assessed with continuous telemetry and indirect calorimetry while sitting, walking, running, and cycling. Sixty volunteers (29 male, 31 female, age 38 ± 11 years) of diverse age, height, weight, skin tone, and fitness level were selected. Error in HR and EE was computed for each subject/device/activity combination. Devices reported the lowest error for cycling and the highest for walking. Device error was higher for males, greater body mass index, darker skin tone, and walking. Six of the devices achieved a median error for HR below 5% during cycling. No device achieved an error in EE below 20 percent. The Apple Watch achieved the lowest overall error in both HR and EE, while the Samsung Gear S2 reported the highest. In conclusion, most wrist-worn devices adequately measure HR in laboratory-based activities, but poorly estimate EE, suggesting caution in the use of EE measurements as part of health improvement programs. We propose reference standards for the validation of consumer health devices ().

Step 1: Understand the scientific question and its correct answer The question is asking in which climate we can find deciduous trees. Deciduous trees are those that lose their leaves seasonally, and the answer given is the humid continental climate. Step 2: Explain the terminology used in the question and answer - Deciduous trees: These are trees that lose their leaves during certain seasons, typically in autumn, as a way to conserve water during winter or the dry season. - Humid continental climate: A type of climate characterized by large seasonal temperature differences and significant precipitation, typically found in the mid-latitudes of the interior of large land masses. Step 3: Provide the supporting facts - In a humid continental climate, there are four distinct seasons, which provide a suitable environment for deciduous trees. These trees can thrive under varying temperature and precipitation conditions. - Deciduous trees, such as oaks, maples, and birches, often require a period of dormancy during the colder season. The cold winters in a humid continental climate allow these trees to undergo this essential dormancy period. - The sufficient precipitation in humid continental climates contributes to the growth of deciduous trees, as these trees typically require a significant amount of water to grow and maintain their broad leaves. - In a humid continental climate, the warm and moist summers allow for a longer growing season during which deciduous trees can photosynthesize and produce energy for their growth and reproduction.

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp .

Some of Australia's most iconic landmarks and locations could be underwater in less than a century, according to a new report by the Climate Council. By 2100 Sydney Opera House could flood every single day, the Gold Coast's famous beaches could be swallowed by the sea, and more than 250,000 homes across the country could be destroyed. Titled Counting The Costs: Climate Change And Coastal Flooding, the report reveals that more than half the Australian coast could be in jeopardy over the next 100 years. The Sydney Opera house could be flooded every day by 2100 according to a new report by the Climate Council. The report revealed that more than 200 billion worth of damage could be done to infrastructure if the sea rises the worst case scenario of 1.1 metres. 'Australia is largely a coastal country. Much of our population lives on or near the coast, and our six state capital cities —Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart, as well as Darwin in the Northern Territory—are all port cities,' the report begins. In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while it's a little lower but still damaging at 62 percent in Queensland. One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, told news.com.au that it is essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact. Queensland's iconic Gold Coast could also be in jeopardy if the sea levels rise by the turn of the century. One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, said its essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact. 'The potential threats to Australia, where the majority of us live on the coast are disproportionately large,' he said in a statement. If the sea rises just over a metre by the turn of the century roads, hospitals, properties, and power stations would all be severly damaged. In the worst case scenario this damage to the coastal regions of the country could cost the economy over 200 billion, according to the report. Almost 250,000 homes could be lost along the Australian coast. The Climate Council warns against ignoring climate change as that could have a detrimental effect on the world's economy. There is also a suggestion that the Gold Coast could be hardest hit, which would mean a huge blow to the tourism profits more than 11 million visitors bring the beachside region each year. As the beaches are lined with high rises so any rise in the sea level could be derimental to the surrounding areas. More than 250,000 homes across Australia could also be at serious risk along with 35,000 kilometres of roads and rails, thousands of commercial buildings and almost 100 hospitals. Soil erosion has already begun to occur on the Gold Coast, seen here at Mermaid Beach. The overall prediction is that sea levels will rise by between 40 centimetres and one metre. The report also revealed that rising sea levels could pose risks to the Great Barrier Reef, and Kakadu National Park. The Climate Council is a not-for-profit organisation which relies on funding from the public. In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while that figure is 62 percent for Queensland. Highlights:","completion":"1.

If the sea level rises as predicted, over half the Australian coast and more than 250,000 homes could be at risk, and damage could cost over 200 billion. 3. Important cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, and Darwin, where most Australians live, could be greatly affected. 4. According to the report, to lessen the impact, it's necessary for Australia to reduce its greenhouse gases. 5.

This rising sea level could also pose risks to places like the Great Barrier Reef and the Kakadu National Park. In short, imagine our precious sandcastles (homes, buildings, etc.) being washed away by the rising tide (sea-level rise due to climate change). If we don't slow it down by being less messy (cutting greenhouse gases), places we love like the playground (Gold Coast) could disappear, which would be really sad."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

If necessary, have your employees sign a written statement indicating this policy. Answer:","completion":"Implementing an anti-discrimination policy in your workplace is essential to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all employees. When it comes to addressing and avoiding discrimination, it is important to take a proactive and comprehensive approach. Here are some steps to consider when implementing anti-discrimination measures at work: 1. Begin by ensuring that all employees are educated about anti-discrimination policies and the types of behavior that are not acceptable in the workplace. It is essential to clearly define what constitutes discrimination and emphasize that jokes based on gender, sexuality, race, or religion are not acceptable. This should be communicated through various channels, such as email, staff meetings, and posted in common areas, to reach all employees. 2. Set up a clear and accessible reporting system for employees to report instances of discrimination, harassment, or any other form of inappropriate behavior. Create a safe space for them to voice their concerns without the fear of retaliation. This may include implementing an anonymous reporting system or designating a human resources or management personnel as a contact person for reporting incidents. 3. Encourage open dialogue and communication about diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Host workshops, seminars, or regular meetings where employees can discuss issues related to discrimination and learn more about different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. This will help create a more understanding and empathetic work environment. 4. Regularly review and update your anti-discrimination policy to ensure it remains relevant and in line with current legislation. As societal views and legal regulations change, your policy should adapt accordingly to maintain its effectiveness. 5. Offer support and resources for employees who have experienced discrimination. This may include counseling services or referrals to external support organizations that specialize in supporting individuals impacted by discrimination. 6. Enforce your anti-discrimination policy consistently and fairly. When an incident is reported or observed, take swift action to address the situation and hold the responsible parties accountable. This may involve conducting an investigation, providing coaching or training, or, in more serious cases, disciplinary action such as suspension or termination of employment. 7. Promote diversity and inclusivity at all levels of your organization. This may include implementing diverse hiring practices, supporting career development initiatives for underrepresented groups, and establishing diversity and inclusion as a core value of your company culture. Remember that the key to avoiding discrimination lies not only in enforcing rules but also in fostering a working environment that celebrates diversity, promotes respect, and values the unique contributions of every individual. By taking a comprehensive approach to anti-discrimination, you empower your employees to feel secure, valued, and heard in the workplace, resulting in a more productive and harmonious working environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: The Sixth Sense Movie plot: Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

This implies identifying a situation or location where the use of a writing instrument is necessary or appropriate. Step 2: Evaluate the options Let's evaluate each option to determine if it is a proper location or situation for using a writing instrument. Option 1: Pocket A pocket is a place where you might store a writing instrument, but it is not a place or situation where you would actually use it. Thus, this option is not the correct answer. Option 2: Purse Similar to the pocket, a purse is also a place where you might store or carry a writing instrument, but not where you would use it. Therefore, this option is not correct either. Option 3: Classroom A classroom is a location where people go to learn, and writing instruments are often needed for taking notes, completing assignments, or participating in writing activities. As a result, this is a place where using a writing instrument is both necessary and appropriate, making it the correct answer. Option 4: Writer's hand Though a writer's hand is where a writing instrument might be held while being used, it is not a location or situation in itself. Therefore, this option is not correct. Option 5: Stationary While stationary is something you would use with a writing instrument, it is not a location or situation where you would use it. Thus, this option is not accurate. Step 3: Justify the choice Based on the evaluation of the options, the correct answer is \\"classroom.\\" This is because a classroom is a location where the use of a writing instrument is necessary and appropriate, as it is commonly needed for various educational activities like taking notes and completing assignments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Some 56% of Americans want the massive federal budget deficit dealt with now instead of when the economy improves, according to a New York Times/CBS poll, and 62% say they would prefer the deficit be addressed through spending cuts, rather than higher taxes. That preference, however, changed when respondents were asked about specific cuts to Medicare or Social Security—the two government programs that touch the most people, and are expected to be the biggest causes of future deficits. Some 55% of respondents said that if Medicare, Social Security, or the military needed to be cut, they would prefer the ax falls on the Pentagon. The findings highlight the difficulty President Obama and Congress will have reaching a consensus on ways to reduce the deficit. House Republicans have called for slashing 2.5 trillion in spending over the next decade, but their plan hasn't specified where most of the cuts will come.","completion":"Title: Americans Prefer Spending Cuts to Address Deficit, But Not to Social Security or Medicare Introduction A recent New York Times/CBS poll revealed that 56% of Americans want the federal budget deficit to be dealt with immediately rather than waiting for economic improvement. The majority, 62%, preferred addressing the deficit through spending cuts as opposed to higher taxes. However, when it comes to cutting specific programs like Medicare, Social Security, or the military, the choices become more complex, highlighting the difficulty President Obama and Congress face in reaching a consensus on ways to reduce the deficit. Spending Cuts vs. Tax Increases According to the poll, a significant majority of respondents preferred addressing the deficit through spending cuts instead of higher taxes. In particular, 62% of the respondents chose the former while only 32% were in favor of raising taxes. This result demonstrates the public's general disdain for tax increases and their preference for the government to curtail spending. A Complicated Choice: Medicare, Social Security, and the Military When asked about specifics, respondents' preferences shifted toward protecting certain programs. About 55% said that if cuts were necessary to Medicare, Social Security, or the military, they would prefer the Pentagon to face budget reductions. This choice was based on the understanding that Medicare and Social Security, as vital social safety net programs, have more direct impact on American lives. The Challenge for President Obama and Congress The poll results underscore the challenges that the President and Congress face in finding a viable solution to the deficit issue. While it is clear that many Americans favor spending cuts, there is a reluctance to cut back on essential social programs, forcing lawmakers to make difficult choices. House Republicans have proposed slashing 2.5 trillion in spending over the next decade, but their plan has yet to specify where most of these cuts will come from. Such vagueness poses the question of the political feasibility of implementing deep reductions in spending without adversely impacting vital government programs. Conclusion As the national debate on how to address the country's massive federal budget deficit continues, it is evident from the New York Times/CBS poll that many Americans favor spending reductions as the primary method. However, despite the general agreement on the need to cut spending, the challenge remains to reach a consensus on which programs to reduce or eliminate without putting Social Security and Medicare at risk. It is up to the President and Congress to strike a balance and find a solution that can satisfy the American people's desire for fiscal responsibility without compromising the country's social safety net."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Romanian language.

Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence from a movie review: a light-hearted way Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Choose from: +negative +positive","completion":"Based on the preceding review, which describes the movie in \\"a light-hearted way,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively. There are a few reasons why mentioning a movie as \\"light-hearted\\" generally suggests a positive perception of the film. Firstly, light-hearted movies are typically associated with entertainment and amusement, which are characteristics that are often appreciated in movies. They may indicate that the film is filled with humor or has an uplifting atmosphere, both of which can appeal to a broad audience. This type of movie can provide an escape from serious themes and evoke moods that are more cheerful and less emotionally distressing, making them an enjoyable experience for viewers. Furthermore, referring to the movie as 'light-hearted' can signify that the reviewer regarded it as straightforward and easy to follow, with a relatively simple plotline that did not get bogged down in complex themes or controversial subjects. Instead, the movie aims to entertain and bring a sense of lightheartedness, which tends to evoke positive emotions. Viewers may appreciate this type of film for its escapism and the pleasure it brings, potentially resulting in a favorable review. Additionally, the phrase \\"light-hearted\\" can imply that the movie strikes a balance between the various elements of storytelling and filmmaking. The characters and story may have been engaging and relatable enough to maintain the viewer's interest while not being too dramatic or heavy-handed. The pacing could have been well-managed, with the right balance of dialogue, humor, and action to keep the audience entertained and invested in the movie's outcome. All of these factors contribute to a positive viewing experience and, consequently, a positive review. In conclusion, describing a movie as 'light-hearted' almost certainly points towards a positive perception of that particular film. The term itself implies that the movie is focused on providing entertainment, which tends to be associated with a positive review. However, it's essential to keep in mind that this analysis is based on a single sentence and cannot encompass the entirety of the reviewer's opinions and thoughts on the movie. Therefore, while the statement of the movie being \\"light-hearted\\" suggests a positive view, further context and details from the review might offer a more comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's opinion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\". - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred. - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance. - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 . - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles. - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom. - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris. - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. and a hint : Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Please answer this question : Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Answer:","completion":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen. This is indicated by the fact that it was left outside on a porch on a rainy day, where it was directly exposed to natural elements which include both water from the rain and oxygen from the air. As a result, the iron bar A rusted completely. On the other hand, Iron Bar B was placed in an airtight bag from which all the oxygen and air were removed to create a vacuum seal. As a result, this bar was not exposed to either water or oxygen, the two key elements needed for rusting to occur, hence it did not show any signs of rusting. The process of rusting involves iron being oxidized by oxygen to form iron(II) ions first, then these ions combine with water and oxygen gas to produce rust. Thus, in the absence of water and oxygen, like in the case of iron Bar B, rusting could not occur. This experiment shows the significant role water and oxygen play in the process of corrosion, specifically in the formation of rust on iron objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Supermarket chain Morrisons has been forced to apologise for turning the Angel of the North into a giant advert for French stick. The store, which is desperate to claw back customers from budget competitors Lidl and Aldi, used a projector to beam a 175ft-long baguette onto the famous artwork. But the piece of bread, which had a the phrase 'I'm cheaper' beamed on to it to reflect recent price cuts, angered many people, who thought it devalued the artwork. 'Defiled': Morrisons has apologised for projected a 175ft baguette onto the Angel of the North in Gateshead, Tyneside. The response to the stunt - which was set up without permission - was led by sculptor Anthony Gormley, who designed the huge, steel statue, which has stood in by the A1 in Gateshead, Tyneside, since 1998. He told the Guardian: 'I'd rather the Angel is not used for such purposes, but it's out there'. Meanwhile, hundreds of social media users who had seen an image posted by Morrisons on Saturday evening, formed a chorus of disapproval. One tweeted that the supermarket had 'defiled' the angel, while others described the move as 'philistine and disgraceful'. Many threatened to boycott the supermarket as a response. Gateshead. council, which maintains the sculpture, said that it was 'disappointed' by the advert, which did not follow its usual procedures for product. placement. Original: The Angel of the North has stood next to the A1 since 1998. Permission: Gateshead council has said it was 'disappointed' that the stunt took place. A spokesman said: 'Many goods and services have and want to be profiled alongside it, and there is a filming process in place to work with organisations to do this, although this does not include lighting the Angel in any way. 'It is disappointing this process does not appear to have been followed.' In light of the backlash from the gimmick, Morrisons apologised for the tactic, which it hoped would be 'something different'. He said: 'We’re sorry if people thought we got carried away by shining a baguette on the Angel of the North and apologise unreservedly to those to whom we have caused offence. 'We were trying something different which was meant to put a smile on people’s faces but clearly it wasn’t to everybody’s tastes. 'We’re so proud of our northern roots and the last thing we want to do is offend anybody.' When it is not being commandeered to advertise baguettes, the Angel of the North is celebrated as one of Britain's best-known pieces of public art. The sculpture, designed by Anthony Gormley, stands not far from the A1 in Gateshead, Tyneside. It was built between 1994 and 1998. At 175ft wide, its wingspan exceeds that of a Boeing 757. The steel statue weighs 208 tonnes and is 65ft high. Its structure is so stable that it only needs to be inspected once every seven years. The statue - which Gateshead council claims is the largest representation of an angel in the world - stands on top of a disused mine. Mr Gormley said that its location helped evoke the region's industrial past, commemorating the hard work and struggles of two centuries of miners, but that it was also meant to mark Britain's transition into the future.

Does \\"Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone.\\" correctly answer the question of The Golden Boot is made of sterling silver, silver gilt and which semi-precious stone?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone\\" does correctly answer the question of The Golden Boot being made of sterling silver, silver gilt, and which semi-precious stone. The response specifies the three materials used in the composition of the Golden Boot trophy: sterling silver, silver gilt, and malachite. Sterling silver is an alloy of silver, containing 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper. This composition provides the silver with the desired strength required for the construction of the Golden Boot trophy. Sterling silver is known for its bright, lustrous appearance and is commonly used in making high-quality jewelry and other decorative items. Silver gilt, also known as vermeil, is a process of applying a thin layer of gold over the surface of sterling silver or another base metal. This technique is often used to provide a gold appearance to silver, while still maintaining the superior strength of the underlying metal. The use of silver gilt in the Golden Boot allows the trophy to retain the beautiful appearance of gold without compromising its structural integrity. Malachite, the semi-precious stone mentioned in the statement, is an important component of the Golden Boot's plinth (base). Malachite is a vibrant green mineral consisting of copper carbonate hydroxide. It is often used for ornamental purposes thanks to its striking color and unique banded patterns. Due to the stone's beauty, it is highly sought after in the world of jewelry and sculpture. The combination of solid sterling silver, silver gilt, and malachite offers a stunning appearance for the Golden Boot trophy, making it a prestigious award in the realm of football. In conclusion, the statement accurately answers the question regarding the materials used in the composition of the Golden Boot trophy. The main body of the trophy is made with solid sterling silver and silver gilt, which provides a gold-like appearance while retaining the strength of silver. The plinth of the trophy is constructed from beautiful malachite, a semi-precious stone known for its vibrant green color and unique patterns, adding an exquisite touch to this prestigious football award."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks. What is a nutritive fluid that some birds provide to their chicks?","completion":"A nutritive fluid that some birds provide to their chicks is called \\"crop milk.\\" This specialized fluid is produced by certain bird species, such as pigeons, flamingos, and penguins, as part of their parental care to nourish their young during the early stages of life. Crop milk is secreted by the crop, a specialized part of the bird's digestive system, and contains essential nutrients, proteins, fats, and antibodies necessary for the proper growth and development of the chicks. Unlike mammalian milk, crop milk has a thicker, more pasty consistency and is regurgitated by the parent bird to feed their offspring. This unique feeding strategy allows these bird species to provide highly concentrated, easily digestible nourishment to their chicks, ensuring their survival and successful growth into independent birds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Paragraph: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","completion":"In the given scenario, Rob is experimenting with a cylinder of gas in three stages - stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A, the gas is at room temperature, which is 300 K. In stage B, he heats the gas, and in stage C, he cools it down. According to the background information, when the gas is heated and its Kelvin temperature is doubled to 600 K, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, leading to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container. This results in a doubling of the pressure of the gas. Conversely, if the temperature were to decrease, the pressure of the enclosed gas would also decrease. When comparing stage B and stage C, we know that the gas has been heated in stage B, whereas it has been cooled down in stage C. Given this information and the relationship between temperature and pressure discussed earlier, we can safely conclude that stage B would see an increase in pressure compared to stage C. In stage B, the increased temperature leads to an increase in kinetic energy and more forceful collisions, causing a higher pressure within the container. In stage C, the cooling down of the gas leads to a decrease in kinetic energy and less forceful collisions, resulting in lower pressure. Therefore, the pressure in stage B is greater than the pressure in stage C, indicating an increased pressure in stage B compared to stage C."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can copper be used in?\\" with the following options: - reducing conducting - heat - boiling - wiring - not conducting - removing conducting - engines - energy The answer to this question is:","completion":"Wiring Given the two facts provided, we can determine that copper is a good conductor of electricity, and wiring requires an electrical conductor. Therefore, copper can be used in wiring, as it fulfills the necessary requirements for conducting electricity. Let's break down the other options to understand why they are not suitable answers: - Reducing conducting: Copper is a good conductor of electricity, so it does not have the property of reducing the conduction of electricity. - Heat: While copper has some heat conductivity, it is not suitable as an answer in this context as the question is focused on copper's role as an electrical conductor. - Boiling: Boiling is not related to the facts provided, as it refers to a process where a liquid turns to vapor when it is heated to its boiling temperature. - Not conducting: This option contradicts the fact that copper is a good conductor of electricity, making it an unsuitable answer. - Removing conducting: This option, similar to \\"reducing conducting,\\" goes against the fact that copper is a good conductor of electricity as it suggests that copper has the property to remove the conduction of electricity. - Engines: Though copper may play a part in some electrical engine components such as brushes for electric motors, the given facts don't point directly toward its use in engines, making it an unsuitable answer for the context provided. - Energy: This is a rather ambiguous term in the given context. While copper is vital for the conduction of electricity, it doesn't directly imply that copper generates energy. Taking all of this into consideration, it is evident that among the provided options, \\"wiring\\" is the most suitable answer, as it directly correlates with the information given in the facts.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Fliehr was born on February 25, 1949 in Memphis, Tennessee. His birth name is widely perceived to be Fred Phillips, although on different documents, he is also credited as Fred Demaree or Stewart, while his biological parents were Luther and Olive Phillips (the latter of which was also credited under the Demaree and Stewart surnames). He was adopted, and at the time of his adoption (arranged by the Tennessee Children's Home Society), his father, a physician, was completing a residency in Detroit. Shortly afterward, the family settled in Edina, Minnesota, where the young Fliehr lived throughout his childhood and after ninth grade he attended Wayland Academy, a coeducational boarding school in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, for four years (five years total in high school), during which time he participated in interscholastic wrestling, football and track. On March 31, 2012, while still contracted to TNA, Flair became the first person to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice, the second time as part of the class of 2012 with The Four Horsemen. On December 17, 2012, Flair returned to WWE as a non-wrestling personality on the annual Slammy Awards show to present the Superstar of the Year award to John Cena, who in turn gave the award to Flair. Flair's return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, escalating into a confrontation that ended with him locking Heyman in the figure-four leglock. After clearing the ring, Flair was assaulted by The Shield, until Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) helped Flair fend off the group. Flair appeared on the main roster sporadically throughout 2013, as The Miz's mentor. He also occasionally appeared on NXT in 2013 and 2014, accompanying his daughter Charlotte to the ring. Flair appeared on the April 28, 2014, episode of Raw, alongside the reunited Evolution (minus Flair) and The Shield; Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, Evolution's opponents at Extreme Rules, effectively turning his back on his old teammates. On July 14, John Cena symbolically handed over his World Heavyweight Championship belt to Flair, telling him to \\"take it\\" while promoting his match at Battleground. On the post-SummerSlam Raw in August 2015, Flair interrupted Jon Stewart, who had saved Flair's 16 world title record by preventing Cena's victory the previous night, telling him that the record would be broken eventually and he would rather it would be by someone who he respects. Flair began making more frequent appearances with Charlotte after she won the Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte's Divas Championship and later WWE Women's Championship defenses. This lasted until the May 23, 2016 episode of Raw, when Charlotte turned on him. On the November 28, 2016 episode of Raw, Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title. On the November 14, 2017 edition of SmackDown, Flair returned to congratulate his daughter, after she won the SmackDown Women's title from Natalya, incidentally in Charlotte's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, this being his first appearance for WWE since nearly dying earlier in the year. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he wrestle again after 2012?","completion":"The article does not specifically mention if he wrestled again after 2012.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend? ? In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. Answer:","completion":"The last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend is Carter. In the article, it is mentioned that \\"In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson.\\" So, Rose's ex-boyfriend is Gil, and his last name is Carter as stated earlier in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: the choroid ciliary body and iris are all part of the?","completion":"The choroid, ciliary body, and iris are all part of the vascular layer of the eye, which is also known as the uvea or uveal tract. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye that lies between the sclera (the white outer layer of the eye) and the retina (the light-sensitive inner layer of the eye). It plays a crucial role in providing blood supply, regulating the admission of light into the eye, and maintaining the shape and function of the eye. The uvea can be divided into three main sections: the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris. 1. Choroid: The choroid is the thin layer of tissue that lies between the sclera and the retina. It is mainly comprised of blood vessels and pigmented cells known as melanocytes. The primary function of the choroid is to supply blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the outer layers of the retina, including the photoreceptor cells responsible for capturing light and converting it into electrical signals. The pigmented cells within the choroid also help absorb excess light to prevent glare and to maintain the sharpness of the images formed on the retina. 2. Ciliary Body: The ciliary body is a circular structure located near the front of the eye, adjacent to the lens. It is responsible for producing aqueous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. This fluid helps maintain the eye's intraocular pressure and provides nutrients to the cornea and lens. In addition to producing aqueous humor, the ciliary body contains the ciliary muscles. These muscles are responsible for the process of accommodation, which allows the lens to change shape and focus on objects at varying distances. When the ciliary muscles contract, they exert pressure on the lens, altering its curvature and enabling the eye to focus on nearby objects. Conversely, when the muscles relax, the lens flattens, allowing the eye to focus on objects located at a greater distance. 3. Iris: The iris is the circular, colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil. It consists of a pigmented epithelial layer and underlying connective tissue, which contains smooth muscle fibers known as the sphincter and dilator pupillae muscles. These muscles control the size of the pupil and, consequently, the amount of light that enters the eye. The sphincter pupillae muscle contracts in response to bright light, causing the pupil to constrict and reduce the amount of light entering the eye. Conversely, the dilator pupillae muscle responds to low-light conditions by expanding the pupil, allowing more light to enter the eye, and thereby improving visibility. The iris also plays a role in giving the eyes their unique color, as the pigment melanin in the iris determines the eye color based on its concentration and distribution within the tissue. In summary, the choroid, ciliary body, and iris are all components of the uveal tract, which is essential for maintaining the normal physiological function of the eye. These structures work together to regulate the admission of light, provide blood supply and nutrients, and sustain the eye's overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families.

Question: Who kills the zombie copilot and pilot in the movie? Movie title: Plane Dead Movie plot: On a routine flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a renegade group of scientists has smuggled aboard a secret container holding a fellow scientist infected with a deadly genetically engineered virus which reanimates the dead. The virus is a variant of the virus malaria created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and a particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak. The uninfected passengers must fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected airliner to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors. Billy, his wife Anna, Burrows, Frank, Paul, and Megan, a stewardess aboard the plane, are all that are left of the uninfected people. They must make their way to the cockpit and signal a fighter jet behind them that there are still living people aboard the 747 or the fighter will destroy them. After managing to get the MP5K from the dead guard, Burrows, Frank and Billy make their way from the tail of the plane to the cockpit, while the couple stay behind. Billy is bitten but manages to kill some of the undead passengers, while Anna comes to help Billy she gets bitten but kills the Undead by thrusting an umbrella into its mouth.

Research shows that practising twenty minutes of meditation a day can reduce stress and cortisol levels. Start slowly and just try to incorporate 3-5 minutes at a time. Meditation can seem strange or alien, so it’s important that you don’t put pressure on yourself. If you don’t feel like sitting cross-legged and reciting a mantra, you could try walking meditation. While walking, concentrate on the feeling of your body walking, Then focus on the feeling of your breath, and then the air and wind on your skin. Yoga can help you to relax your body and mind before you go to bed. Keep the routine slow and controlled, and don’t over exert yourself. A simple routine of five to fifteen minutes, with only simple poses, is all you should do. Some of the basic poses to try include: Standing bends. Standing up straight, raise your hands above your head. Feel the stretch in your spine, and then gently bend down. Keep your back straight. Child’s pose. Sit on your heels, and place your arms out either side of you. Lower your body over your knees and as you do this gently bring your forehead down towards the floor. One good way to try to relax your body and help you get to sleep is to practice some progressive muscle relaxation techniques. Lie in bed and then tense a muscle, contracting and flexing it, for around ten seconds. Don’t put too much strain on the muscle, but feel the tension building up. Release the muscle and relax. Now move on to the next muscle and repeat the process all over your body. You can start from your feet and work all the way up your body. Finish by tensing and relaxing your face. Try visualising the muscle that you are tensing as you go. Doing some deep breathing exercises can help you to lower your heart rate and relax. If you are struggling to sleep and are becoming anxious, deep breathing can help. The effects of deep breathing are often more psychological than physiological, but it can help you to calm your heart and breathing rate in times of stress or anxiety. Breathe in deeply for three or four seconds, with your hand on your belly and try to breathe in and out. Breathe in through your nose and exhale out through your mouth. Feel your diaphragm move up and down as your belly rises and falls. Breathing this way will stimulate the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system. By stimulating the PNS you will relax your body and lower your heart rate and anxiety. Sleeping problems are often associated with stress, anxiety and depression. If you are regularly having trouble sleeping, consider what other factors might be contributing to this. If you are particularly stressed out about an upcoming deadline, try to manage your workload and understand that’s normal to get stressed sometimes. Positive thinking can help you to be more relaxed and get a better night’s sleep. A stressful lifestyle can result in higher levels of cortisol in your body, which in turn can cause sleeplessness. If you have nightmares that disturb your sleep, these may also be connected to stress or emotional trauma. Ensuring that your bedroom is as calm and soothing as possible will help you get to sleep without any pills. Avoid bright colours on the walls, try not to have a TV or computer in your room, and make sure that it is dark. You can get some blackout curtains if there is light coming from outside your window, and if necessary, try wearing an eye mask. The temperature of your room is also important. A temperature of between 60 and 65°F (16 and 18°C), is considered the ideal for peaceful sleep. If it is noisy, try wearing ear plugs to block out the sound. Having pictures of friends and family, or works of art, around your room may make you feel more relaxed and at ease.

Article: Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, but with night skies around 1,000 times brighter than globally accepted levels, it gains a bad reputation for its light pollution. A study by Hong Kong University found that brightness levels in the southern Chinese city's popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui were 1,200 times greater than the international dark sky standard. The crowded city of 7 million residents , full or residential high-rises, towering office blocks and neon advertisements, has no laws to control outdoor lightning. The result is that light pollution is thought to be much worse than in other large cities, including London, Sydney, Tokyo and Shanghai. \\"In Hong Kong , you can't go anywhere outdoor in the evening without your eyes being blinded by this really disturbing outdoor lightning,\\" the light pollution survey's head Jason Pum told AFP. \\"The fact that we have all this light in the sky means energy is wasted,\\" he said, adding that too much artificial lightning also affects nightly wildlife. Research has suggested that light pollution can cause a number of harmful health effects in humans, including sleeplessness and headaches and can also interrupt body clocks and hormones . The university survey, the result of five million measurements taken from points across the city, was released just days before the start of the annual Earth Hour event, organized by the World Wildlife Fund. People around the world will be encouraged to turn off the lights for an hour on Saturday night to raise awareness of climate change.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.

Which reservior would most likely not have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B? There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Reservoir B would most likely not have excellent water quality.

A: Answer:","completion":"Plants support themselves above the ground to get light and oxygen through various mechanisms. These include: 1. Rigid cell walls: Plant cells have rigid walls made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which provide structural support and maintain their shape under pressure. 2. Turgor pressure: The pressure of water inside plant cells – known as turgor pressure – pushes the cell walls outward, helping to hold the plant upright. 3. Vascular tissues: Vascular plants have specialized tissues called xylem and phloem that provide structural support and transport water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. 4. Lignin: Lignin is a complex polymer that adds rigidity and strength to the plant cell walls, especially in woody plants, enabling them to grow taller and sturdier. 5. Growth patterns: Plants have evolved various growth patterns and adaptations to help them efficiently capture light and oxygen, such as apical dominance (where the main stem grows more rapidly and suppresses side branches) and phototropism (where plants grow towards the light). By using all these mechanisms, plants can successfully support themselves above the ground to access light and oxygen, which are essential for photosynthesis and respiration processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before his relationship with Anne, Henry favoured her sister Mary, who was by then married to her first husband, William Carey, and a lady in waiting to his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon. Despite her objections, Mary is forced to become the king's mistress, with her husband's reluctant permission and agreement. Mary asks her husband if she's offended him, and he claims that she hasn't, although Mary despairs that William did not object to the illicit union with the king. In time, Mary confesses what she has done to God, and feel guilty whenever she serves the queen, for the queen knows about the relationship, yet says nothing. Mary soon comes to terms with being the king's mistress, however, and begins to fall in love with the king. Meanwhile, Anne, portrayed as the younger sister (despite being the older sister in the book) falls in love with Lord Henry Percy, heir to the title of Duke of Northumberland. Lord Henry is already betrothed, either without Anne's knowledge, but it is more likely that she doesn't care. Anne and Henry frequently flirt and kiss, and, despite Mary's warnings, soon consummate their affair when Mary is at the height of her power as the king's mistress. It takes great courage for Mary to literally run to their parents and their uncle, who belittle Anne and tell her that she's made a grave mistake and, despite her beliefs that they are betrothed, that the love of her life is already engaged to the daughter of an earl.

The Romani (also spelled Romany , ), or Roma, are a traditionally itinerant ethnic group, living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Sindh regions of modern-day India and Pakistan. A DNA study conducted by Indian and Estonian research facilities shows that the Roma/Romani/Gypsy and Sinti people originate from the so-called \\"Untouchable\\" Dalit community from India. The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity. They are a dispersed people, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Roma people have a number of distinct populations, the largest being the Roma and the Iberian Cale or Calo, who reached Anatolia and the Balkans about the early 12th century, from a migration out of northwestern India beginning about 600 years earlier. They settled in present-day Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Hungary and Slovakia, by order of volume, and Spain. From the Balkans, they migrated throughout Europe and, in the nineteenth and later centuries, to the Americas. The Romani population in the United States is estimated at more than one million. Brazil has the second largest Romani population in the Americas, estimated at approximately 800,000 by the 2011 census. The Romani people are mainly called by non-Romani ethnic Brazilians as ciganos. Most of them belong to the ethnic subgroup Cales (Kale), of the Iberian peninsula. Juscelino Kubitschek, Brazilian president during 1956-1961 term, was 50% Czech Romani by his mother's bloodline; and Washington Luis, last president of the First Brazilian Republic (1926-1930 term), had Portuguese Kale ancestry. There is no official or reliable count of the Romani populations worldwide. Many Romani refuse to register their ethnic identity in official censuses for fear of discrimination. Others are descendants of intermarriage with local populations and no longer identify only as Romani, or not at all. As of the early 2000s, an estimated 3.8 to 9 million Romani people lived in Europe and Asia Minor. although some Romani organizations estimate numbers as high as 14 million. Significant Romani populations are found in the Balkan peninsula, in some Central European states, in Spain, France, Russia, and Ukraine. The total number of Romani living outside Europe are primarily in the Middle East and North Africa and in the Americas, and are estimated in total at more than two million.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

Given the below context: Nathu La is located on the 563 km (350 mi) Old Silk Route, an offshoot of the historic Silk Road. The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, Nepalese, and Bhutanese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet. In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957.

Fact: evaporation is a stage in the water cycle process Question: The state of a gas vaporized from a surface liquid under increased pressure and higher temperatures is What's the answer?","completion":"The state of a gas vaporized from a surface liquid under increased pressure and higher temperatures is referred to as supercritical fluid. To understand this concept, let us delve into the properties of matter and phase transitions. Matter exists in different states, such as solid, liquid, and gas. These states depend on the temperature and pressure exerted on the substance. When a liquid evaporates to form a gas under normal conditions, it goes through a phase transition. However, under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, the distinction between the liquid and gas phases disappears, and the substance enters a unique state called the supercritical state. In the context of the water cycle, evaporation refers to the process by which water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state, called water vapor. This transformation occurs when water is heated and its molecules gain energy, allowing them to escape the liquid phase and enter the atmosphere. When we increase the temperature and pressure of a substance, it enters a supercritical state. For water, the critical point (where it becomes a supercritical fluid) is reached at a temperature of 647.096 K (373.946 °C or 705.103 °F) and a pressure of 22.064 MPa (218.3 atm or 3,169 psi). In this state, the supercritical fluid exhibits properties of both liquids and gases. A supercritical fluid can diffuse through solids like a gas and dissolve materials like a liquid. It also has a much higher density than a regular gas, resulting in increased solvation power and better mass transfer properties. Due to these unique characteristics, supercritical fluids are widely used in various industries, such as extraction, reaction media, and chromatography. Therefore, the state of a gas vaporized from a surface liquid under increased pressure and higher temperatures is a supercritical fluid with properties that differ from those of gases and liquids in their normal states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It includes many of the common themes of the genre, including a clearly defined good-versus-evil plot and the inclusion of various fantasy monsters. The hero of the story is the Ice Warrior, who sets out on a quest to find the legendary Emerald Sword, with which he can defeat the Dark Lord Akron. Each new chapter of the story is described in the booklet accompanying that CD.

The band relied on the use of both soprano vocals and death grunts. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Alex Holzwarth was born on 4 October 1968 in Landshut, Germany and is a professional drummer, former member of Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He is the brother of bass guitarist Oliver Holzwarth. - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material. - Dawn of Victory is the third album studio released by Rhapsody in 2000 .

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Old Ebenezer Scrooge is a cruel man for whom life's only passion has become only money; he hates Christmas, even the very mention of it, lives alone and only to work. He is very strict with his only, underpaid and overworked, employee, Bob Cratchit, and does not believe in giving away to charity or being kind to anyone. One Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge receives a ghostly visit from his long deceased partner Jacob Marley, who had died exactly seven years before on that same day. In his life, Jacob Marley had been just as selfish and uncaring as Scrooge was now. He tells Ebenezer about how his soul has not had a moment's rest since his death and how his spirit has been doomed to wander the earth looking down at what might have been, had he been a different man. He tells Scrooge that he wants to spare him that same fate, and that on that night, he will receive the visits of three spirits. After Jacob departs, Scrooge heads for his bed with no intention of having his sleep be interrupted by anyone. Still, precisely as Jacob Marley had predicted, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives at one o'clock. He and Scrooge depart together for the Christmases that have already been, and from the experience, Scrooge gains a painful memory of the person he was, and how he became what he is today. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shares with Scrooge the Christmases being celebrated on that same year, especially the merriment being had at his nephew Fred's home; Fred had invited him to dinner, and Scrooge, as usual, had declined the invitation. From this experience, Scrooge also learns about Bob Cratchit's family, and how his youngest son, Tiny Tim, is a fragile creature supported by a crutch who may be doomed to die unless he receives better nourishment, more than his father can provide. Finally, Scrooge receives the last of the visits, from the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and Scrooge finds himself a changed man after he learns of the cruel fate in store for Tiny Tim, as well as the...

Q: Passage: The Home Rule Crisis was a political and military crisis in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that followed the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1912. Ulster unionists, determined to prevent any measure of home rule for Ireland, formed a paramilitary force, the Ulster Volunteers, which threatened to resist by physical force the implementation of the Act and the authority of any Dublin Parliament by force of arms. Irish nationalists responded by setting up the Irish Volunteers \\"to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\\". Both sides then began importing weapons and ammunition from Germany, in the Larne gun-running and Howth gun-running incidents. HM Government's ability to face down unionist defiance was thrown into question by the \\"Curragh incident\\", when dozens of British Army officers tendered their resignation rather than secure arms against Ulster loyalist seizure, forcing a climb-down by the government. The crisis was temporarily averted by the outbreak of World War I. The Home Rule Bill was enacted, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the war.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? spiced","completion":"To determine whether the phrase \\"spiced\\" is considered positive or negative, let's analyze the context and possible interpretations of the word. Step 1: Analyze the word's meaning \\"Spiced\\" generally refers to the addition of spices or flavors to a dish or a situation. Spices are often used to enhance the taste of food or bring out the flavors in a dish. Step 2: Consider possible interpretations \\"Spiced\\" can have different interpretations depending on the context in which it is used. If a dish or event is described as \\"spiced,\\" it can have a positive connotation indicating that it is enhanced or flavorful. However, in some cases, it might have a negative connotation, such as when something is overly spiced or when it implies conflict or excitement in an otherwise calm situation. Step 3: Evaluate the given context In the absence of any specific context provided, the word \\"spiced\\" by itself leans more towards a positive connotation due to its association with enhanced flavors and taste in food. Conclusion: The phrase \\"spiced\\" can be considered positive in most contexts, as it generally denotes the enhancement of flavors or an interesting element added to something, such as a dish or an event. However, it is important to consider the context and the particular situation in which the word is used, as it may sometimes have negative implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not possible to tell The provided statement, \\"There are people in a catamaran,\\" only speaks to a part of the original premise, which is \\"Several people in a catamaran are struggling with the wind while another boat is nearby.\\" While we have confirmation that there are people in a catamaran, we do not have any information about their struggle with the wind or the existence of another boat in the vicinity. The first part \\"Several people in a catamaran\\" matches with \\"There are people in a catamaran\\". However, the other parts of the premise—the people in the catamaran struggling with the wind, and the presence of another boat nearby—are not addressed in the given statement. In the original premise, the people in the catamaran aren't just there, they are also \\"struggling with the wind,\\" implying poor weather conditions or trouble maneuvering. This may well indicate some level of tension or distress in the situation. The other element in the premise is the presence of another boat nearby, implying a proximity of another vessel that could be either a random coincidence, an observer, potential rescuer or possibly related to the struggle with the wind. All these details add further perspective and layers to the situation that are not present in the statement \\"There are people in a catamaran.\\" Therefore, based on the information offered by the statement, it is impossible to fully confirm or refute the truth of the premise.

Article: By 2050 there will have been an extra 2.5 billion people on earth. And what will they eat? To solve the problem, we should have to double our food production. We can also develop a diet of algae , insects and meat grown in laboratories. Algae can grow very quickly at sea, in polluted water and in places that would normally kill food crops. They are already eaten widely in Japan and China and they are eaten by almost everything from shrimps to blue whales. They can fix CO2 in the atmosphere and provide fats and sugars. Man-made meat looks like meat, feels like meat and it is meat, although it's never been from a living, breathing animal. Instead, it is grown from cells in big containers. Moreover, studies show that producing man-made meat will use far less water, energy and land. China has developed \\"green super rice\\", a series of rice types which produce more grain and have stronger ability to fight against floods, salty water, insects and disease. We used traditional plant breeding techniques to cross-breed more than 250 rice types. Green super rice, which is enough to feed an extra 100 million people, will be planted widely in the coming years. Insects like ants are not on most European menus but at least 1,400 kinds are eaten across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Now, with rising food prices and worldwide land shortages, such insects are getting more and more popular. Not only are many insects rich in protein , low in fat and high in Ca and Fe, but insect farms need little space. And they can grow well on paper, algae and industrial wastes.

The story apparently taken from a Gujerati Play is awesome,the treatment is superb with some exceptions. In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good Director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease the Finacier and the Grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers.

If an isomer has more branching than another isomer, it should have a higher or lower melting point? Answer:","completion":"An isomer with more branching than another isomer should have a lower melting point. To understand this, let's first discuss what isomers and branching mean, and the factors that affect boiling and melting points. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, meaning that they are composed of the same number and types of atoms, but differ in the arrangement of atoms within the molecule. This leads to variations in the physical and chemical properties of the molecules. For example, two isomers of butane (C4H10) can have distinct chemical and physical properties because they have different structures: n-butane (a linear isomer) and isobutane (a branched isomer). Branching refers to the arrangement of carbon atoms in a molecule. In branched isomers, the carbon atoms are attached to one another in a non-linear, tree-like structure, as opposed to linear isomers, where the carbon atoms are connected in a straight chain. The degree of branching may affect various physical properties of the isomers, including melting and boiling points. Melting and boiling points are largely determined by the strength of intermolecular forces between molecules. These forces are primarily influenced by the molecule's shape, size, and polarity. When comparing isomers with varying degrees of branching, the primary factors affecting melting and boiling points are the strength of London dispersion forces and the accessibility of the molecule's surface area. London dispersion forces are weak, temporary attractive forces caused by the momentary fluctuation in electron distribution within a molecule. These forces become stronger as the surface area of the molecule in contact with its neighbors increases. Linear isomers, with their long, straight chains, offer a larger surface area for interaction with neighboring molecules than branched isomers, resulting in stronger London dispersion forces. Branched isomers, on the other hand, have a more compact, spherical shape due to their branching, which reduces the overall surface area in contact with neighboring molecules. This leads to weaker London dispersion forces. Since melting and boiling points are determined by the energy required to overcome these intermolecular forces, weaker London dispersion forces in branched isomers result in lower melting and boiling points compared to their linear counterparts. Therefore, when comparing two isomers with different degrees of branching, the isomer with more branching will generally have a lower melting point. Other factors aside, more compact and spherical branched isomers experience weaker intermolecular forces than linear isomers, and as a result, require less energy to overcome these forces and transition from a solid to a liquid state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources. Now answer this question: The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas what?","completion":"The acceptance of new concepts and sciences by universities brought these ideas legitimacy, respectability, and support for the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Priyadarshan/Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (at an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before it, this movie was a huge disappointment. Like others have commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stale to begin with, just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week.

Background: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. Paragraph: Rob got a compass as a present for his birthday. The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group might act as a magnet, group A or group B?

Question: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","completion":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products. According to Le Châtelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium experiences stress, it will work to counteract that stress and establish a new equilibrium. In test C, John observed a forward reaction, which indicates that the stress applied to the system favored the forward reaction over the reverse reaction. As a result, the concentrations of the products increased, and the concentrations of the reactants decreased. In contrast, in test D, John observed a reverse reaction. This observation implies that the stress applied to the system favored the reverse reaction over the forward reaction. Consequently, this would lead to a decrease in the concentrations of the products and an increase in the concentrations of the reactants. In summary, test C experienced a forward reaction that led to higher concentrations of the products, whereas test D experienced a reverse reaction that resulted in decreased concentrations of the products and increased concentrations of the reactants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

En Vogue is an American R&B/Pop vocal group whose original lineup consisted of singers Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones. Formed in Oakland, California in 1988, En Vogue reached number two on the US Hot 100 with the single \\"Hold On\\", which was taken from their 1990 debut album Born To Sing. The group's 1992 follow-up album Funky Divas reached the top 10 in both the US and UK, and included their second US number two hit \\"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\\", plus the US top 10 hits \\" In the late-1980s, Oakland-based production and songwriting duo Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy first conceived the idea of a modern-day girl group in the tradition of The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Ronettes and other commercially successful female bands which had flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s when they were assembling their 1988 compilation project FM2 for Atlantic Records. Foster and McElroy envisioned an entertainment unit with interchangeable but not identical parts in which every member would qualify to take the lead on any given number. Thus, their plan was to recruit singers who possessed strong voices, noticeably good looks, and intelligence. Approximately 3000 women attended the auditions held in 1988, with Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones making the final cut. Originally conceived as a trio, Foster and McElroy decided to create a quartet after hearing Terry Ellis audition whose plane had been late from Houston, Texas. At first, they selected the band name 4-U but soon shifted to Vogue, ultimately settling on En Vogue, upon learning that another group had already claimed the Vogue moniker. After forming, the group began working with their producers on their debut album. Recording began in August 1989 and wrapped up in December of the same year. Born to Sing was released on April 3, 1990. The album peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 3 on Billboard's R&B Albums Chart. The first single, \\"Hold On,\\" was released to radio in late February 1990 and became a crossover pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and No. 1 on both the R&B singles and Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. It later went to No. 5 in the UK, and became a hit in Europe. The next two singles, \\"Lies\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Worry,\\" each went to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts, while the fourth and final single, \\"Don't Go,\\" charted at No. 3 on the Billboard R&B. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA. \\"Hold On\\" was awarded a Billboard Music Award for \\"#1 R&B Single of the Year,\\" a Soul Train Award for \\"R&B/Urban Contemporary Single of the Year, Group, Band or Duo\\" and have been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.

The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost 150. In the second, 1,500. \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to 1,500. \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night. The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year. \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.

A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers.

The game is full of humor and the intro screen is in magazine style . - Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games. In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. \\"Bullet hell\\" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.

His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death.

Can you tell me the answer to what kind of chemical reaction is rusting of iron??","completion":"Rusting of iron, also known as iron corrosion, is an example of a redox (reduction-oxidation) chemical reaction, more specifically, it is a combination of oxidation and reduction processes. In this reaction, iron, being a reactive metal, reacts with oxygen in the presence of water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. The entire process involves electron transfer between the reactants. Let's break down the rusting process in detail. 1. Oxidation of iron: The primary step in the rusting process is the oxidation of iron, during which iron atoms lose electrons to form positively charged iron cations (Fe²⁺). This process can be represented by the equation: Fe (s) → Fe²⁺ (aq) + 2e⁻ Here, iron (Fe) loses two electrons, transforming into Fe²⁺ and releases the two electrons (2e⁻). 2. Reduction of oxygen: In the presence of water, the released electrons are used to reduce oxygen molecules. Oxygen tends to gain the electrons and reacts with water to form hydroxide ions (OH⁻). The reaction can be represented by the following equation: O₂ (g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻ (aq) In this reaction, oxygen and water gain the electrons, forming OH⁻ ions. 3. Formation of hydrated iron(III) oxide (rust): Finally, the Fe²⁺ ions produced in oxidation step react with OH⁻ ions generated in the reduction step to form iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), which then reacts further with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O), also known as rust. The two combined equations for this final process are: 2Fe²⁺ (aq) + 6OH⁻ (aq) → 2Fe(OH)₃ (s) and 2Fe(OH)₃ (s) + O₂ (g) + 2H₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃·xH₂O (s) Putting all the three reactions together, we get the overall balanced equation of the rusting process: 4Fe (s) + 3O₂ (g) + 6H₂O(l) → 4Fe₂O₃·xH₂O (s) Rusting of iron is an exothermic reaction as it releases energy in the form of heat. It is important to note that the rusting process is also greatly facilitated by the presence of salts and acidic substances. In summary, the rusting of iron is a redox chemical reaction that mainly involves the combined processes of oxidation, reduction, and rapid formation of hydrated iron(III) oxide or rust. Understanding this reaction can help us to find appropriate ways to prevent or minimize the corrosion of iron in everyday applications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. and the situation: Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A. Answer the following question: Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","completion":"Ted learned more about methane. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The background information states that saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes, and they have specific naming based on the number of carbon atoms. 2. Methane is specifically mentioned as the smallest alkane with just one carbon atom. 3. The situation tells us that Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. 4.

Is \\"The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How long have the boundaries of somerset remained constant\\"","completion":"While the statement \\"The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times\\" does provide some idea about the constancy of the Somerset boundaries, it can be further elaborated and improved to adequately address the question \\"How long have the boundaries of Somerset remained constant.\\" A more detailed response could be as follows: The boundaries of Somerset, located in South West England, have predominantly remained constant since the medieval era, which is roughly 1,000 years ago. Evidence of Somerset's existence as an independent entity can be traced back to the early Anglo-Saxon period, when it was a key part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Somerset's earliest clear boundaries can be dated back to the late 9th century, during the reign of Alfred the Great. At that time, Somerset comprised parts of the ancient British tribal territories, which were later divided into sub-kingdoms. King Ine of Wessex gave these sub-kingdoms fixed boundaries in the 7th century. By the late medieval period, Somerset's boundaries were relatively similar to today's, featuring areas such as Monmouthshire in the north, Wiltshire and Dorset in the east, and Devon in the west. Throughout the centuries, however, subtle boundary alterations have taken place as a result of political, administrative, and social changes. Some examples of these alterations include the merger of the ecclesiastical authorities of Bath and Wells, the division of the county into hundreds, and the establishment of local government districts in 1894 and 1974. The most significant change came in 1974 when a local government reorganization extended Somerset's northeastern border by incorporating the previously separate county of Avon. Despite these modifications, the core of Somerset's boundaries has remained remarkably constant over the past millennium. In conclusion, the boundaries of Somerset have stayed relatively constant for at least 1,000 years, with only minor alterations from the late medieval period up to the present day. While there have been some changes and adaptations in the region's political landscape, the fundamental elements of Somerset's boundaries as recognized in the medieval era remain largely preserved today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Guatemala is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The capital is Guatemala City, which also serves as the national capital. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize. Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. - The Darién Gap is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama's Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department in South America. The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway. - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately , called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to \\"Guinness World Records\\", the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \\"motorable road\\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - Huehuetenango is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It is situated in the western highlands and shares borders with Mexico in the north and west; with El Quiché in the east, with Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos to the south. The capital is the city of Huehuetenango. - Guatemala City, locally known as Guatemala or Guate, is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Guatemala, and the most populous in Central America. The city is located in the south-central part of the country, nestled in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita. In 2009, it had a population of 1,075,000. Guatemala City is also the capital of the local Municipality of Guatemala and of the Guatemala Department. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast.

Article: On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population. Question: When the first explorers arrived on the island, they _ .

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they actually convey slightly different information. Let's break down the differences: Sentence 1: \\"Pill Hill became part of Brookline in 1844 when Boston annexed it.\\" In this sentence, Pill Hill is the focus, and it states that it became part of Brookline in 1844 when it was annexed by Boston. This suggests that the area known as Pill Hill was originally a separate entity and was incorporated into Brookline after the annexation. The emphasis here is on Pill Hill's transition from being an independent area to becoming a part of Brookline. Sentence 2: \\"In 1844, Brookline became a part of Pill Hill when it was annexed from Boston.\\" This sentence focuses on Brookline and suggests that it became a part of Pill Hill when it was annexed from Boston in 1844. In this case, it is implied that Pill Hill was an existing area, and Brookline was incorporated into it during the annexation. The emphasis here is on Brookline's incorporation into the larger Pill Hill area. In summary, while both sentences discuss the 1844 annexation, sentence 1 implies that Pill Hill became a part of Brookline, while sentence 2 implies that Brookline became a part of Pill Hill. Although they both describe an event in 1844 involving Pill Hill, Brookline, and Boston, they place the emphasis on different aspects of the annexation and suggest different interpretations of the relationship between Pill Hill and Brookline at that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first question is asking why people don't worry as much about a thing called estrogen (a hormone found in animals) in milk and other dairy products, compared to the worry they have about something called phytoestrogens (hormone-like substances) in soybeans. People sometimes worry that eating too many soybeans might not be good for them, but they don't think about it as much when they drink milk or eat cheese. 2. The second question is a bit different. It's asking for some fun and interesting facts that have a clear explanation. It's like asking, \\"Tell me something really cool about animals or plants or space that I can understand easily.\\" So, to sum it up, the first question is about the difference in how people think about hormones in dairy and soy, while the second question is a request for exciting and easy-to-understand facts.

He worked at ground zero for 11 days beside his colleagues -- many of them, including Hilaire, not wearing a mask. He was later assigned to a landfill in Staten Island, where debris from the World Trade Center was dumped. For about 60 days between 2001 and 2002, the New York police officer was surrounded by dust. In 2005, Hilaire was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He underwent surgery and radiation. Just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that multiplies the body's plasma cells to dangerous levels. It's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life. Hilaire was 34. More than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, officially offering him medical insurance under the World Trade Center Health Program. About 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program, a representative told CNN.

No These two sentences do not mean the same thing. Although both sentences describe an academy with four primary components, the arrangement and names of these components are different in each sentence. In Sentence 1, the academy has a central hall, an east wing, a west wing, and a garden. This implies that the main area of the academy is the central hall with two wings extending to the east and west. In this configuration, the central hall is the core part of the building, with the wings being secondary structures. In Sentence 2, the academy has an east hall, a central wing, a west wing, and a garden. Here, it's different because the main area is now referred to as the east hall, and the central component is a wing instead of a hall. In this scenario, the east hall seems to be a prominent part of the academy, and the central wing is more of a connector between the east hall and the west wing. In both cases, the garden is mentioned as a part of the academy but does not specify its location or relation to the other components in either sentence.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected.

Given the question: Information: - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the local government council for \\"Na h-Eileanan Siar\\" council area of Scotland, comprising the Outer Hebrides. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Sea of the Hebrides is a portion of the North Atlantic Ocean, located off the coast of western Scotland, separating the mainland and the northern Inner Hebrides islands (to the east) from the southern Outer Hebrides islands (to the west). To the north, the Sea of the Hebrides joins The Minch. - Skye, or the Isle of Skye (or \\"Eilean a' Cheò\\"), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic \\"Sgitheanach\\" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - The Cuillin (Scottish Gaelic: An Cuilthionn or An Cuiltheann) is a range of rocky mountains located on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The true Cuillin is also known as the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuilin (na Beanntan Dearga, known locally as Red Hills) across Glen Sligachan. The Red Cuilin hills are lower and, being less rocky, have fewer scrambles or climbs. - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority. - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh or Sgalpaigh na Hearadh i.e. \`\` Scalpay of Harris '' to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye ) is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).

Albini was born in Pasadena, California, to Gina (nee Martinelli) and Frank Addison Albini. His father is a wildlife researcher. He also has two siblings. In his youth, Albini's family moved often, before settling in the college town of Missoula, Montana in 1974. Albini formed Shellac in 1992. With bandmates Bob Weston (formerly of Volcano Suns), and Todd Trainer (of Rifle Sport, Breaking Circus and Brick Layer Cake), they initially released three EPs: The Rude Gesture: A Pictorial History (1993), Uranus (1993) and The Bird Is the Most Popular Finger (1994)--the first two EP releases were on Touch and Go, while the third EP was a Drag City label release. Two years after formation, the Japanese label NUX Organization released a Japan-exclusive live album in CD format titled raivuinDong Jing --an English-language reference to the name Shellac cannot be found anywhere on the CD product, which was not available outside Japan. The live album was followed by five studio albums: At Action Park (1994), Terraform (1998), 1000 Hurts (2000), Excellent Italian Greyhound (2007) and Dude Incredible (2014). All of Shellac's studio albums were released on vinyl as well as CD. Albini explained in 2010 that Shellac had made a decision early in their existence that they would not play at festivals and this position was articulated to All Tomorrow's Parties (ATP) festival organizer Barry Hogan during the preparation stage of the inaugural ATP event. However, Scottish band Mogwai managed to convince Albini at the time that they were ATP curators and the band was very impressed by the experience: \\"They (ATP) completely changed the festival game.

Question: \\"Who controlled Glatz after the treaty was signed?\\" Context: \\"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector.

The pair record videos glorifying God and their cause, and bid their unknowing families and loved ones goodbye, while trying to behave normally to avoid arousing suspicion. The next day, they shave off their hair and beards and don suits in order to look like Israelis. Their cover story is that they are going to a wedding. An explosive belt is attached to each man; the handlers are the only ones with the keys needed to remove the belts without detonating them.

Q:I have a new situation: John is a biologist. Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats. But I can use this background: Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range. What is an answer for this question: Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? A:","completion":"To answer the question of which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A (Gold-striped salamander) or Species B (fire salamander), let's compare their reproductive strategies and success factors. Step 1: Analyze reproductive adaptations - Species A (Gold-striped salamander) has a slender, long body that protects their larvae from being washed out by currents in their stream-dwelling habitat. - Species B (fire salamander) is less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats but has a higher fecundity. Step 2: Assess limitations - For Species A, the elongated body increases the risk of desiccation, decreases dispersal ability, and negatively affects fecundity. - For Species B, it is not as well adapted to stream-dwelling habitats, so its success is limited in those habitats. Step 3: Evaluate overall reproductive success - Species A has some advantages in reproduction by preventing its larvae from being washed away, but its elongated body leads to several limitations that hinder overall reproductive success. - Species B is less specialized, but its higher fecundity and broader geographic range make it more successful in general. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, Species B (fire salamander) would be more successful in reproduction, as it has a higher fecundity and a broader geographic range, allowing it to reproduce in varied habitats and adapt more easily to changing conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'.

Question: Process: - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more movement happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case involving increased movement during hibernation, can negatively affect an animal's ability to hibernate properly. This is because hibernation is a delicate physiological process, and any deviation from the animal's typical lowered state of activity can have both direct and indirect consequences on an animal's health and energy reserves throughout the hibernation period. Here's a breakdown of how increased movement can hurt the animal during hibernation: 1. Energy consumption: The primary purpose of hibernation is to conserve energy. When an animal's movement increases during hibernation, it will consume more energy, which may not be sustainable during winter months when food resources are limited. This can lead to exhaustion of the animal's fat reserves and even premature death. 2. Disruption of metabolic processes: Hibernation involves a significant decrease in an animal's metabolic processes, including heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature. Increased movement can disrupt these processes, forcing the animal's body to work harder to compensate, which can further strain its energy reserves and negatively impact its overall health. 3. Inadequate rest and recovery: Reduced brain activity and physical movement during hibernation allow the animal to preserve energy and undergo critical restorative processes, such as tissue repair and immune system maintenance. Increased movement may disrupt these processes, leading to increased susceptibility to illness, injury, and other health issues. 4. Disturbance to hibernating habitat: Excess movement can potentially affect the animal's hibernation environment, making it less suitable for hibernation. This may lead to the animal's exposure to extreme temperatures, predators, or other potential hazards. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased movement during hibernation can indeed have direct and indirect effects on an animal's ability to hibernate properly. This disruption can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including heightened energy consumption, disruption of metabolic processes, inadequate rest and recovery, and potential disturbance to the hibernation environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Future of Money and Mobile Commerce If you’re over the age of 20, you’ve likely used a credit card, counted change and maybe even written a check. But is all that about to change? Mobile payment hasn’t become the de facto method of financial transactions just yet, but it is projected to overtake those archaic checkbooks and bank notes you’ve been lugging around. Our friends at SapientNitro have compiled research to create this infographic, which details the past, present and possible future of mobile commerce. The company shares the three types of mobile payments that dominate the marketplace today: m-commerce (uses a mobile browser and online wallets), m-payments (uses mobile apps), and m-wallets (replaces your entire wallet). Furthermore, consumers can access several forms of transaction on their mobile devices, including scannable barcodes, mobile coupons and self-checkout. But are consumers ready to wholeheartedly adopt the latest in mobile payment technology? Adults who are unbanked, for instance, may face a barrier to mobile transactions — there are currently 17 million unbanked adults in the U.S. But many smartphone users welcome the convenience of mobile payments (87% in the UK), while others worry about the privacy factor (79% in Asia). Still, 49% of consumers in the U.S. found shopping on a smartphone awkward. Then again, many people found paper checks awkward and credit cards confusing the first time around. Where do you fall in the mobile payment debate? What kinds of transactions do you handle on your smartphone? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Additionally, they grapple with a high prevalence of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and inadequate sanitation, further exacerbating their healthcare challenges. The inadequate healthcare infrastructure in these countries often leads to limited access to basic healthcare services, resulting in a higher prevalence of preventable illnesses and a higher mortality rate. Rural areas, in particular, are disproportionately affected, as healthcare facilities are often concentrated in urban centers. This forces those living in rural communities to travel long distances to access medical care, incurring high costs and sacrificing significant time in the process. Aside from the lack of physical infrastructure, the shortage of skilled healthcare professionals is a major challenge faced by developing countries. Insufficient training, inadequate compensation, and poor working conditions often result in healthcare professionals choosing to work in private sectors or migrate to more developed countries. This brain drain further strains the already fragile healthcare systems in these countries, leaving a significant gap in the provision of healthcare services. To address these challenges, developing countries require consistent and sustainable investment in their healthcare systems. This can be achieved by investing in the construction of new healthcare facilities, the implementation of comprehensive public health policies, and improving the quality of education and training programs for healthcare professionals. Moreover, collaboration with international organizations and developed countries is essential in the pursuit of knowledge exchange, technical assistance, and financial support in order to strengthen healthcare systems and improve the overall health outcomes of the population. It is crucial for leaders in these countries to prioritize healthcare as a fundamental right for their citizens and work collectively to ensure that healthcare services are accessible, affordable, and effective for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the address of Tony Hancock in 'Hancock's Half Hour'?","completion":"Tony Hancock, the prominent British comedian, starred in the groundbreaking BBC radio and television series 'Hancock's Half Hour.' Created by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the show first aired on radio in 1954, later transitioning to television in 1956, and entertained audiences until 1961. In 'Hancock's Half Hour,' Hancock's character lived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, a fictional address in a real suburban area in Greater London. East Cheam is part of the London Borough of Sutton. In the series, his residence serves as an essential backdrop to the comedy, encapsulating Tony's desire for a higher social standing amid his middle-class surroundings. Throughout the show, 23 Railway Cuttings is depicted as a dilapidated yet charming house, where Tony lives with fellow resident, and sometimes adversary, Sid James, played by the actor of the same name. The peculiar address adds a touch of absurdity and quirkiness to the show, contributing to the distinctive humor that characterizes 'Hancock's Half Hour.' It is worth mentioning that Sid James later left the show, and Tony's subsequent housemate, played by actor Bill Kerr, was introduced to maintain the dynamic. The success of 'Hancock's Half Hour' can be attributed to its blend of satire, wit, and realistic depiction of post-World War II British society. Hancock's address at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, played a role in cementing the show's uniqueness and appeal, making it a classic example of British radio and television comedy."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

So first, we need to get all the 'v's together. Let's subtract 99*v from both sides of the equation so we can bring them together. When we do that, we still have 30 left on the one side (because 30 has nothing to subtract), and on the other side we get 104*v - 99*v. This equals to 5*v (because 104 minus 99 is 5). So our equation now looks like 30 = 5*v. Now that we only have 'v' once, we want to find out what number it stands for. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 (because 'v' is being multiplied by 5). When we do this, we find out that 'v' equals 6 (because 30 divided by 5 is 6).

Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This is VOA. The National Cryptologic Museum is on Fort George G. Meade, a military base near Washington, DC. The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding. People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information. The National Cryptologic Museum celebrated 60 years of cryptologic excellence in 2012. One event there marked the sixtieth anniversary of the National Security Agency. Two former NSA workers shared their memories of operating a code machine called Sigaba. In 1940, an American woman named Genevieve Grotjan found some information being repeated in Japanese coded messages. Her discovery helped the United States understand secret Japanese diplomatic messages. After the United States understood the code, it was possible to study messages from the Japanese ambassador to Germany and to his supervisors in Japan. Understanding these messages helped the United States prepare for a possible war in the Pacific with Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor. the American naval commander in the Pacific Ocean was Chester Nimitz. His forces were much smaller than the Japanese Naval forces. And the Japanese had been winning many victories. Joseph Rochefort had worked for several months to read the secret Japanese Naval code called JN-25. If he could understand enough of the code, he would be able to give Admiral Nimitz very valuable information. From the beginning of 1942, the Japanese code discussed a place called \\"AF.\\" Joseph Rochefort felt the Japanese were planning an important battle aimed at \\"AF.\\" After several weeks, he and other naval experts told Admiral Nimitz that their best idea was that the \\"AF\\" in the Japanese code was the American-held island of Midway. Admiral Nimitz said he must have more information to prepare for such an attack. The Navy experts decided to trick Japan. They told the American military force on Midway to broadcast a false message. The message would say the island was having problems with its water-processing equipment. The message asked that fresh water be sent to the island immediately. This message was not sent in code. Several days later, a Japanese radio broadcast in the JN-25 code said that \\"AF\\" had little water. Joseph Rochefort had the evidence he needed. \\"AF\\" was now known to be the island of Midway. He also told Admiral Nimitz the Japanese would attack Midway on June 13.The battle that followed was a huge American victory. That victory was possible because Joseph Rochefort learned to read enough of the Japanese code to discover the meaning of the letters \\"AF.\\" One American code has never been broken. Perhaps it never will. It was used in the Pacific during World War Two. For many years the government would not discuss this secret code. Listen for a moment to this very unusual code. Then you may understand why the Japanese military forces were never able to understand any of it. The code is in the voice of a Native American. The man you just heard is singing a simple song in the Navajo language. Very few people outside the Navajo nation are able to speak any of their very difficult language. At the beginning of World War Two, the United States Marine Corps asked members of the Navajo tribe to train as Code Talkers. The Cryptologic Museum says the Marine Corps Code Talkers could take a sentence in English and change it into their language in about 20 seconds. A code machine needed about 30 minutes to do the same work. The Navajo Code Talkers took part in every battle the Marines entered in the Pacific during World War Two. The Japanese were very skilled at breaking codes. But they were never able to understand any of what they called \\"The Marine Code.\\" The Cryptologic Museum has many pieces of mechanical and electric equipment used to change words into code.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Eurovision: we Brits just don’t get it The BBC controls our entry because it pays so much to the European Broadcasting Union. For this, we’re guaranteed a place in the final, to the fury of the other nations, who can see how little effort we put into it. Our entry is chosen by an anonymous BBC official, who evidently has a supercilious disregard for the whole show. The corporation is in many ways a national treasure and excels at news, drama, radio and documentaries, but it is baffled by popular culture. It has proven itself to be the Ukip of Eurovision, fielding candidates in a foreign contest that it holds up to ridicule. There are complicated factors at play, and yet the BBC seems blind to them. The winning song needs to cut across the boundaries of 39 countries, with wildly different musical traditions. Eurovision is an annual search for a common currency – everyone wants to do a Lili Marlene. During the war, this tune was popular with troops on all sides, and has become one of the most enduring and evocative songs of the last century. The right Eurovision song can do this, smashing through political, cultural and linguistic boundaries. Abba’s Waterloo has lost none of its explosive power over the decades. Italy’s 1958 entry, Volare, is still sung all over the continent, wherever beer is served late enough. Music is just the first level. The lyrics need to make some kind of sense to 60 million people who speak 32 languages. Or countries can score by going to the other extreme and exude ethnic pride. As the European people have lost interest in “ever closer union”, so Eurovision scores have tended to reward self-proud ethnic styles. Ukraine’s Ruslana won in 2006 with a song that started with the trembitas, an alpine horn used by Hutsul shepherds. Level three lies in the political zeitgeist: the ability of a Eurovision entry to articulate the historical moment. It can be a girl from 1970 Londonderry or 1982 West Germany singing about peace. Finland’s entry is about gay marriage, hoping to capture the mood this year. The Terry Wogan approach to Eurovision – that it is a parade of foreigners for us to laugh at – was entertaining but out of date long before he quit. Eurovision has mutated into a complex musical and political festival with a broader constituency embracing countries the EU is keeping at arm’s length. It is one of the few arenas where countries like Moldova and Armenia can be welcomed into the comity of Western nations. They tend to sing their hearts out as a result, and victory means the world. Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, a protest against the Kremlin’s enduring influence, came months after its Eurovision win. A YouGov poll this week suggests 75 per cent of Brits blame our Eurovision defeats on a discriminatory block vote system. This is nonsense: we do badly because our songs are dreadful. Yet Britain exports music worldwide. Our artists accounted for one in every six records bought in France and Germany last year. Adele, Mumford and Sons and One Direction recorded four of America’s five best-selling albums. Our nation’s musical talent is immense, and much of it as international as the contest itself. This sums up our European problem perfectly: on a people-to-people level, relations are great. But when you get institutions involved, it all turns sour. We could win Eurovision every year, if we chose. We just need to try.","completion":"The BBC's control over the UK's Eurovision entry, due to its financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union, leads to frustration from other nations who perceive minimal effort put into the contest by the UK. The BBC's lack of understanding of popular culture may contribute to this issue. The ideal Eurovision song transcends political, cultural, and linguistic boundaries, as opposed to the dismal performances submitted by the UK in recent years. The UK has immense musical talent and could succeed in the competition if a more serious and dedicated approach were taken."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The East Asia/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region’s most populous country. China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases. Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs. Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides Iceland, in the world, at 3%.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Now, I have a new situation: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Answer this question please: Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Answer:","completion":"Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke. Given that Washington state experiences many wildfires year-round, it is more likely that the people living and visiting the state would be exposed to the wildfire smoke and its associated pollutants, including carbon dioxide. Due to the prevalence of wildfires in Washington, the concentration of wildfire smoke and its components, such as particulate matter and carbon dioxide, would be higher in the air, posing a greater risk to the health of the individuals in the state. In contrast, Oregon experiences almost no wildfires, which means that the state's air quality would be significantly better and cleaner compared to Washington. The residents and visitors in Oregon would be less likely to inhale carbon dioxide from wildfire smoke, as the occurrence of wildfires and the resultant smoke would be minimal. Therefore, considering the wildfire frequency and the potential exposure to smoke, more people would be inhaling carbon dioxide from wildfire smoke in Washington state than in Oregon. However, it is essential for individuals visiting or living in areas with frequent wildfires to be aware of these potential health risks and take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, using air purifiers indoors, and monitoring local air quality to ensure their safety and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frequently; Given those answer options, answer the question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.

His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle.

He successfully defended Bithynia against Alexander's general, Calas, and consequently maintained the independence of the region. Bas' son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia, continued to preserve the autonomy of Bithynia against other powerful leaders, such as Lysimachus and Seleucus I. He assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE, further cementing the region's independence. Nicomedes I, the son and successor of Zipoetes I, played a pivotal role in the development and prosperity of Bithynia. He founded the city of Nicomedia, which quickly grew in wealth and importance. Throughout his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE) as well as those of his successors, Bithynia maintained its status among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Interestingly, Nicomedes I invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries. However, this decision led to complications when the Galatians later turned against his son, Prusias I. Despite this betrayal, Prusias I managed to defeat the Galatians in battle. The final Bithynian king, Nicomedes IV, struggled to hold his position against Mithridates VI of Pontus. With the help of the Roman Senate, he was restored to his throne but eventually chose to bequeath his kingdom to the Roman republic by will in 74 BCE. This marked the end of Bithynia as an independent kingdom and began its integration into the Roman realm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But, some newer energy-saving compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs do. Check the packaging that the bulbs came in for warnings regarding their mercury content. Energy-saving bulbs typically contain no more than 4 mg of mercury—just enough to cover the tip of a pen. Even if the CFL bulb contains mercury, it might be in gaseous rather than liquid form. LED bulbs don’t contain liquid mercury. Tilt switches (sometimes called “mercury switches”) were used in older appliances to transmit an on/off signal. Appliances in the home that may contain mercury include chest freezers, televisions, thermostats, washing machines, space heaters, clothes dryers, and washing machines. Contact the appliance manufacturer or check your user manual to confirm if a given appliance has mercury. Contact an appliance recycler or your local hazardous waste collection center for information regarding the best way to dispose of these appliances. You might be able to locate up to 3 grams of mercury in thermostats. Most normal batteries do not contain mercury. However, the smaller “button cell” batteries that are used in watches, hearing aids, toys, pacemakers, and other devices still contain mercury. If you can find a device containing these small batteries, you’ve probably found liquid mercury. Certain pharmaceutical products might contain liquid mercury. Skin antiseptics, facial creams, contact lens solutions, and some vaccines could contain liquid mercury. To confirm that your pharmaceutical products contain liquid mercury, check the ingredients label or contact the manufacturer. Clocks from the 1600s or before often used liquid mercury as a pendulum weight. If you own such a clock, it probably contains liquid mercury. Summary:","completion":"This article discusses the presence of liquid mercury in various items, including older incandescent light bulbs, CFL bulbs, home appliances, button cell batteries, pharmaceutical products, and antique clocks, and advises checking packaging, user manuals, or contacting manufacturers for mercury content information and proper disposal methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Antennas are characterized by a number of performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application. Chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. The antenna's power gain (or simply \\"gain\\") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit. What is the answer to this question: What would most likely be the main concern in making this decision?","completion":"The main concern in making the decision of selecting or designing an antenna as discussed in this article is related to the performance measures of the antenna. Specifically, the major factors to consider include the directional characteristics and the resulting gain of the antenna. The directional characteristics, depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern, tell us about the directions in which the antenna effectively transmits or receives radio waves. It is crucial in making sure the antenna performs optimally for the desired application. The pattern could be highly directional (radiation concentrated in a certain direction), omnidirectional (radiating in all horizontal directions), or something in between. The resulting gain of the antenna, on the other hand, is related to the concentration of the antenna's power. In the context of this article, even omnidirectional or weakly directional antennas can increase gain by focusing more power in the horizontal directions, rather than wasting it by radiating towards the sky or the ground. It's essential to note that the gain is not just about the power transmitted; it also accounts for the efficiency of the antenna. In fact, the antenna's power gain, often simply referred to as its 'gain,' is often the primary figure of merit. This means it's the most crucial characteristic users refer to when gauging its potential performance. Because of this, the gain directly impacts the ultimate selection or design decision. In conclusion, to make an informed decision when selecting or designing antennas for a specific application, one should focus on understanding the antenna's directional characteristics and its expected gain, as these will directly affect the antenna's efficiency and overall performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Please answer this question : Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","completion":"Village A did not display an observable Allee effect. Village A showed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, which implies that there was no decline in population size and a loss of genetic diversity that could result in an observable Allee effect. The growing population likely maintained or even increased its genetic diversity, contributing to the evolutionary potential and overall fitness of the species inhabiting the village. On the other hand, Village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically, which leads to a higher likelihood of an observable Allee effect. The decline in population size and the isolation of the village could result in a reduction in genetic diversity, potentially causing negative consequences such as genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding depression, and a decrease in the overall fitness of the species living there. This contrast in population dynamics and potential impacts on genetic variation highlights the differences between the two villages, with Village A not displaying an observable Allee effect and Village B more likely to experience it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow.

Dennis had always envied Nelson for his seemingly effortless ability to charm women. It was as if Nelson had some kind of magnetic pull that attracted them to him wherever he went. Dennis, on the other hand, struggled to even string a sentence together when faced with a woman he found attractive. Step one: Assess the situation Dennis knew he had to overcome his awkwardness if he ever wanted to be as confident as Nelson. So, he decided to analyze the situations where he felt the most awkward around women and find ways to improve. Step two: Observe Nelson in action One weekend, Dennis decided to join Nelson on a night out with the intention of closely observing his friend's behavior around women. He noticed how Nelson easily engaged in conversation with them, made them laugh, and maintained eye contact. Step three: Identify the differences Dennis realized that the main difference between him and Nelson was confidence. Nelson appeared self-assured and comfortable in his own skin, which allowed him to be more relaxed and genuine in his interactions with women. Step four: Develop a plan Determined to become more confident, Dennis devised a plan. He would start by joining a public speaking course to help him become more comfortable with speaking in front of others. He would also work on developing his self-esteem by setting achievable personal goals and journaling his progress.

The Aube has 365 historical monuments, 144 of which are registered and 221 are classified. 2. The Aube has 365 historical monuments of which 144 are enrolled and 221 are classified. In both cases, it is discussed that: - The Aube possesses 365 historical monuments. The term 'Aube' likely refers to a department or geographical region in France, which is known for its historical monuments and significance. This is the primary subject of both sentences. - There are 144 monuments that are either 'registered' or 'enrolled.' While the terms 'registered' and 'enrolled' are not identical, in context they refer to the same process. This likely suggests that these monuments have met certain legal, cultural, or historical criteria to be officially recognized or listed in some form of registry or roll. - Lastly, there are 221 monuments that are classified. 'Classified' generally implies these monuments are categorized based on some notable characteristics, criteria or importance, such as historical period, architectural style, cultural significance, etc. In concise, the two sentences have a tiny lexical variation (registered vs enrolled), but in terms of overall meaning pertaining to the Aube’s historical monuments' status and quantity, they're indeed conveying the same information. The takeaway from both sentences is, within Aube's collection of 365 historical monuments, 144 are recorded in an official listing and 221 have been sorted into categories for their notable attributes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johan van Banchem, was one of the leaders of the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt on August 20, 1672, he was rewarded for this crime with an appointment as \\"baljuw\\" of The Hague by which office of steward, designated a medieval official and then a national leader, William III? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Johan van Banchem was indeed one of the leaders involved in the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt on August 20, 1672. This violent act occurred during a period of heightened political tension in the Dutch Republic, and the De Witt brothers were blamed for the country's military failures and accused of conspiring against the young Prince William III of Orange. As a result of his participation in the lynching, Johan van Banchem was rewarded with an appointment as \\"baljuw\\" (bailiff) of The Hague. This position was granted to him by Stadtholder William III, who later became King William III of England, Scotland, and Ireland as well. A baljuw, historically a medieval official, played an essential role in the administration of justice and the enforcement of law and order within their appointed jurisdiction. The appointment of van Banchem by William III can be seen as a display of gratitude for his part in the removal of the De Witt brothers, who were perceived by some as obstacles to William III's rise to power. In summary, Johan van Banchem's involvement in the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt was rewarded with the position of baljuw of The Hague by the future national leader, Stadtholder William III."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Public officials could have been behind a ‘deliberate cover-up’ of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, MPs will warn today. In a damning report, they call for an urgent investigation into the loss of crucial files on the abuse of at least 1,400 vulnerable young girls by mainly Asian men. Their inquiry into the scandal heard evidence from an anonymous council researcher who had gathered evidence of failures to tackle the abuse. Scroll down for video. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, has called for an 'urgent investigation' into the loss of files. The woman claimed an unknown person stole a draft report from her office in 2002 which had been set to go to the Home Office. There was no forced entry and access was only through key-coded and locked security doors. Her report had contained severe criticisms of the relevant agencies in Rotherham, with the most serious alleging ‘indifference’ by senior managers. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up. ‘The only way to address these concerns is with a full, transparent and urgent investigation.’ One victim of men in the area, of which there are thought to be around 1,400, fell pregnant twice and tried to end her life. The committee’s report added: ‘This is not the first case in which it has been alleged that files relating to child sexual exploitation have disappeared.’ The influential panel also demands new powers of recall for police and crime commissioners after South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright clung to his position for weeks before finally quitting. The full horror of the scandal over 16 years came to light in August in the Jay Report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. Sometimes, there are people who are supposed to take care of and protect others, but instead, they do very bad things. In a place called Rotherham, a group of people did bad things to many young girls. Some people who work for the government might have known about it and tried to hide it from everyone else. They did this by getting rid of important papers that had information about the bad things happening.

This includes airplanes which are objects that need to move. 2. The second hint says that \\"airplanes create thrust using propellers, jet engines, or rockets.\\" This implies that one of the ways airplanes can create the necessary thrust to move is through the use of propellers. 3. Therefore, combining both hints, it becomes clear that the purpose of the propellers on some airplanes is to create or give thrust which is required for them to move.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation, apples or ginger? A:","completion":"A: Given the new situation, the ginger had a shorter shelf life because of bad preservation. This is because Joey, who candied ginger, peaches, pineapple, and oranges, had some humidity in the room, which negatively affected the sugaring process.

Michael climbs onto the roof and tries to drive them off the road, but Rachel slams on the brakes, sending Michael slamming onto the gravel below.

But Jamie is too curious and walks over to Michael's lifeless body, taking his hand in hers. Right then, Rachel spots her and yells for her not to touch him. Suddenly, Michael's grip tightens on his knife as he begins to rise. Jamie ducks down as the police begin firing at him. Michael eventually stumbles backwards into an abandoned mine shaft, apparently dead. The police then set up a dynamite, causing the entire shaft to explode, but Michael, who we now know is alive, but mortally wounded, has already managed to crawl out into the river below.

The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space . - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films. - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals. - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace. - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations. - Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, it is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies.

Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, and escape for one last \\"Goonie adventure\\".They head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon, unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout.

Which entity is this text about? , Malcolm Denzil Marshall (18 April 1958 - 4 November 1999) was a West Indian cricketer. Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen ever to have played Test cricket. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers, a short man - he stood at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), while most of the great quicks have been well above 6 feet (1.8 m) and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or above. Marshall made his Test debut in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League. Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career. In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid.","completion":"This text is about Malcolm Denzil Marshall, a West Indian cricketer who was primarily a fast bowler and is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen to have played Test cricket."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The Iraqi revolt against the British, also known as the 1920 Iraqi Revolt or Great Iraqi Revolution, started in Baghdad in the summer of 1920 with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman army, against the British occupation of Iraq. The revolt gained momentum when it spread to the largely tribal Shia regions of the middle and lower Euphrates. Sheikh Mehdi Al-Khalissi was a prominent Shia leader of the revolt. Sunni and Shia religious communities cooperated during the revolution as well as tribal communities, the urban masses, and many Iraqi officers in Syria. The objectives of the revolution were independence from British rule and creation of an Arab government. Though the revolt achieved some initial success, by the end of October 1920, the British had crushed the revolt. Although the revolt was largely over by the end of 1920, elements of it dragged on until 1922. During the 1920 revolt, another anti-British rebellion took place in the north Iraq by the Kurds, who were trying to gain independence.

There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture. Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Western land would have fewer wetland plants growing on it. The Eastern land is described as being covered in wetlands, which are characterized by hypoxic soils due to flooding. Wetland plants, such as water-lilies, have adaptations like aerenchyma to cope with these low-oxygen conditions, allowing them to thrive in the flooded and hypoxic soils present in wetlands. On the other hand, the Western land has rich soil that is suitable for agriculture. Agricultural land typically requires well-drained soil with good aeration, which implies that there is less likelihood of extensive wetland areas, flooding, or hypoxia. Consequently, the Western land would have a lower abundance of wetland plants, as these conditions are not ideal for their growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, in some cases, a single incorrect letter can result in a hilarious and unintended twist. One such incident occurred in the recent romance novel titled \\"Baby, I'm Yours,\\" written by Susan Andersen. The Unfortunate Typo The novel features a passionate scene between two characters, but an unfortunate typo steals the spotlight. The passage reads, \\"He stiffened for a moment but then she felt his muscles loosen as he shitted on the ground.\\" Of course, the author meant to write 'shifted' instead of 'shitted,' which drastically changed the meaning and mood of the scene. Author's Response Susan Andersen was understandably embarrassed and mortified by the slip in her novel. In a statement addressing the issue, she wrote, \\"Shifted—he shifted!” as a means to apologize to her readers who had purchased the book in e-book form. Immediate Action Cognizant of the seriousness of the error, Andersen contacted her editor and emphasized the need to rectify the typo in the e-book version promptly. While physical copies of the novel may still carry the mistake, one can hope that the digital versions will have the corrected text. A Lesson for Writers and Editors This humorous incident serves as an important reminder to writers and editors alike – proofreading is a crucial aspect of the publication process. The smallest of mistakes can drastically alter the meaning of a sentence or scene, ultimately affecting the reader's experience. Conclusion In the world of writing, typos are an unavoidable reality, and some can become the source of laughter and storytelling.

Review title: para dormir Product review: Un elenco exhorbitante carente de parlamentos con sentido comun. La historia es buena pero vagamente trabajada. Para un dia de lluvia y a falta de cualquier otra pelicula o evento de ver, pues resuelve. Answer:","completion":"This review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step-by-step justification: 1. The review is in Spanish, so the first step is to understand it. The title loosely translates as \\"for sleeping\\". This implies that the person who wrote the review may find the product boring or unengaging, which is generally a negative sentiment. 2. The main body of the review translates to something like \\"An exorbitant cast lacking in common sense dialogues. The story is good but vaguely worked. For a rainy day and in the absence of any other movie or event to watch, it solves.\\" This review seems to be about a movie or a show. 3. While the reviewer does note that the story is good, they also criticize the dialogue and describe the story as 'vaguely worked'. These are negative points that lower the overall assessment of the product. 4. The last line suggests that this product would be a last resort - good for a rainy day when there's nothing else to watch. 5. Therefore, the overall tone of the review is more negative than positive, so this would likely decrease the chances of buying the product. However, it’s worth mentioning that tastes and preferences can be subjective and diverse among different users. What one user might not like might appeal to another. Yet, typically, we assume average preferences for determining how a review might affect potential customers."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Problem:Paragraph- Sent 1: If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. Sent 2: If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. Sent 3: In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Sent 4: Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. Sent 5: No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. Sent 6: In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. Sent 7: In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sent 8: Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. Sent 9: \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. Sent 10: \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. Sent 17: \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. Sent 18: \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: How many defendants were ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000, and how long after a PFA is filed does the plaintiff have to establish a custody order?. Solution:","completion":"Task explanation: 1. Understand the question: The question asks for the number of defendants ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000 and the duration within which a plaintiff has to establish a custody order after filing a PFA. 2. Extract information from the paragraph: Read through the paragraph to find relevant information: Sent 5 mentions the maximum fine paid was 250. Sent 12 mentions the maximum fine for contempt of PFA is 1000. Sent 15 mentions that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. 3.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. a classic color that is always in step with the times and scientific research. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Certainly, I can fix the sentence that you provided with the correct capitalization. The revised sentence would look something like: \\"A Classic Color That Is Always in Step With the Times and Scientific Research.\\" Let's dissect this sentence to understand why the changes were made: 1. \\"A Classic Color\\": Both 'a' and 'classic color' stand at the start of the sentence, so the letter 'a' needs to be capitalized. Also, 'classic color' is a key segment of the sentence, so both 'classic' and 'color' are capitalized. However, it's not necessarily a requirement to capitalize these words in regular sentences unless it's a title or heading. 2. \\"That Is Always in Step\\": 'That' is a conjunction joining the previous and the following phrases. Generally, we do not capitalize conjunctions, prepositions or articles (a, an, the) unless they are at the beginning of the sentence or title. However, 'is' is a verb, and 'Always' an adverb, 'in Step' being a prepositional phrase marking a point in time linked to style or progression. In title capitalization methods, it's acceptable to capitalize these. 3. \\"With the Times\\": 'With' is a preposition and following above logic, it can be capitalized. 'The' is an article word and it is typically lower case in sentence structures unless it begins the sentence or the sentence intended is a title. 'Times' here refers to different time periods or eras, which makes it a focal point of the sentence. 4. \\"And Scientific Research\\": The word 'and' is a conjunction, allowing it to be lower-case in regular sentences. But in this sentence structure, similar to previous logic, it can be capitalized. 'Scientific Research' are two key words representing a specific field of study, making them important enough to be capitalized in the context of this sentence treated as a title. Do note that capitalization rules can slightly differ based on specific style guides like APA, MLA or the Chicago Manual of Style. The changes made here reflect 'title case' capitalization which is commonly used for titles of books, articles, or chapters. In regular sentence structures, only the first word of a sentence and proper nouns are typically capitalized."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the evening progressed, it became increasingly evident that the chemistry between Derrick and Justin was nowhere near what either of them had expected. The awkward silences and forced laughter filled the atmosphere throughout the extravagant candlelit dinner. Derrick, trying to salvage any possible connection, desperately steered the conversation towards topics he believed might pique Justin's interest. Despite his efforts, nothing seemed to work, and Justin became continuously uncomfortable with each passing minute. Having heard so much about Justin through mutual friends, Derrick had found himself incredibly attracted to him on both a physical and personal level before ever meeting. He had thought that a lavish dinner would be the perfect way to impress Justin and potentially stir up romantic sentiments. However, as the dinner unfolded, it became glaringly apparent that the two were remarkably different, and the compatibility that Derrick had initially imagined simply didn't exist. On the other side of the table, Justin, a modest and self-sufficient individual, felt a gnawing sense of guilt as he attempted to endure the failed date with the ever-so-attentive Derrick. To Justin, the ostentatious dinner was not only overwhelming but also felt like an unnecessary waste. As the expensive wine flowed, the weight of Derrick's financial investment in this evening only amplified Justin's feeling of being used, further intensifying his discomfort. Although Justin was genuinely appreciative of Derrick's generous gesture, he couldn't shake the feeling that it was done solely as an attempt to wooing him. The conspicuous disparity between their expectations and reality made it almost impossible for Justin to enjoy what should have been a pleasant, stress-free meal. The fact that he had allowed Derrick to pay for such an overpriced dinner, in spite of their evident lack of spark, only worsened the situation. It left Justin feeling not only emotionally uncomfortable but also guilty that Derrick spent a significant amount of money on this ultimately fruitless encounter. As the night drew to a close, both Derrick and Justin struggled to find a suitable way to bring the intolerably uncomfortable evening to an end. Derrick, utterly disappointed and confused by the lack of connection, found himself questioning what went wrong, while Justin was wracked with guilt, feeling as though he had used Derrick for a meal he had no intention of reciprocating with genuine interest or affection. The perplexing experience would ultimately leave both men cautious and self-aware in their subsequent romantic encounters, reinforcing the importance of compatibility and honest communication over material displays of affection in building a successful relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What was the capital of the ancient Assyrian civilisation?","completion":"The capital of the ancient Assyrian civilization was not static throughout its long history, but rather shifted between several major cities over time, reflecting the varying centers of power and influence within the empire. However, the most well-known and influential capitals of the ancient Assyrian civilization were Ashur, Nimrud (also known as Kalhu or Calah), Dur-Sharrukin, and Nineveh. 1. Ashur: The city of Ashur (also spelled Assur or Asshur) was the original and most ancient capital of the Assyrian civilization. Located on the western bank of the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq, Ashur was an important religious and cultural hub as well as a center of political power. It was named after the Assyrian national deity, Ashur, emphasizing the city's significance to the Assyrian people. The rise of the Assyrian civilization can be traced back to the early second millennium BCE, when Ashur was established as the capital. Although the capital later shifted to other cities, Ashur continued to hold immense religious and cultural importance for the Assyrians, with numerous temples, palaces, and artifacts found in the archaeological remains of the city. 2. Nimrud: The city of Nimrud, also referred to as Kalhu or Calah, became the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BCE). Nimrud, located upstream along the Tigris River from Ashur, was chosen as the new capital for its strategic military position and fertile soil. Ashurnasirpal II carried out a massive reconstruction of the city, commissioning grand palaces, temples, and monuments adorned with intricate reliefs and sculptures. The famous Northwest Palace, which contained the so-called \\"Banquet Stele of Ashurnasirpal II,\\" was among these grand constructions. Under the patronage of subsequent kings, Nimrud continued to flourish both culturally and politically for more than a century. 3. Dur-Sharrukin: In 717 BCE, King Sargon II decided to create a monumental, purpose-built capital that would exhibit Assyria's wealth and glory. Dur-Sharrukin, today known as Khorsabad, was the result, located about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) northeast of Nineveh. The city featured numerous grand buildings, including palaces, temples, and administrative structures, all constructed within a monumental walled temenos. The walls themselves were decorated with narrative reliefs, depicting scenes of warfare, hunting, and daily life in Assyria. Despite its monumental scale and architectural significance, Dur-Sharrukin's period as capital was short-lived. Upon Sargon II's death in 705 BCE, his son and successor, Sennacherib, abandoned the city to focus on the expansion and development of Nineveh. 4. Nineveh: Nineveh, located near the modern city of Mosul in Iraq, rose to prominence as the Assyrian capital in the early seventh century BCE during the reign of King Sennacherib. Nineveh was an ancient city, with its roots stretching back to the early 3rd millennium BCE, but Sennacherib transformed it into one of the world's largest and most magnificent cities of its time. He ordered the construction of an extensive aqueduct system, beautiful gardens, and a colossal palace known as the \\"Palace without Rival.\\" Nineveh remained the capital of Assyria until the empire's fall in 612 BCE, when it was sacked by a coalition of the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. Notably, Nineveh's grand library under King Ashurbanipal contained a collection of clay tablets with writings in cuneiform script, a trove of priceless information on ancient Mesopotamia that has been essential to modern understanding of the Assyrian civilization. In conclusion, throughout the ancient Assyrian civilization, the capital shifted between several cities, including Ashur, Nimrud, Dur-Sharrukin, and Nineveh. Each of these cities experienced generations of political, cultural, and architectural significance while serving as the capital, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the Assyrian world. Today, their archaeological remains continue to provide invaluable insights into the history and culture of the Assyrian Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

No These two sentences may appear to be similar, but they convey different meanings due to the use of the words \\"renditions\\" and \\"transfers.\\" Let's examine each sentence and their meanings individually to better understand the differences. 1. \\"This last solo made the extended renditions live seven minutes or more.\\" - In this sentence, the word \\"renditions\\" refers to performances, interpretations, or versions of something, like a piece of music or a work of art. In this context, the sentence is saying that because of the last solo, the extended performances (most likely musical) lasted for seven minutes or longer. 2. \\"This last solo made the extended transfers live seven minutes or more.\\" - In this sentence, the word \\"transfers\\" could refer to several things, such as the movement of data, ownership, or even people from one place to another. However, it is not entirely clear what type of transfers are being discussed. Regardless, the sentence is talking about the last solo making the extended transfer processes last for seven minutes or more. In summary, the two sentences have different meanings, with the first referring to performances, likely musical in nature, and the second referring to some form of transfers, which could range from data to ownership or even the transportation of people.

Answer the following question: Background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Paragraph: John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D.

Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.

On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house. In the basement, Sarah discovers the family's dismembered dog.

Baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies. The script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time. The sound FX do not sound real, they stick out way too much (technical gadgets etc.) If they are trying to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps, because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that. Natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent, which gives it a void-like atmosphere.

Most characters seem empty and false, they simply haven't casted this movie very well.

It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Strømmens Værksted A/S was an industrial company based in Skedsmo, Norway, specializing in the production of rolling stock. Founded in 1873, it remains as a part of Bombardier Transportation. The plant is located just off Hovedbanen west of Strømmen Station. - The term rolling stock originally referred to any vehicles that move on a railway. It has since expanded to include the wheeled vehicles used by businesses on roadways. It usually includes both powered and unpowered vehicles, for example locomotives, railroad cars, coaches, and wagons. - A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\". - Skedsmo is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillestrøm. About one third of the municipal population lives in Lillestrøm. Other important towns are Skedsmokorset, Skjetten and Strømmen. A smaller settlement adjoining Lillestrøm is Kjeller. - Strømmen Station is a railway station on the Trunk Line in Skedsmo, Norway. It is served by the Oslo Commuter Rail line 400 operated by Norwegian State Railways running from Lillestrøm via Oslo S to Asker. The station was opened in 1854 along with the rest of the Trunk Line. - Trondheim Bilruter or TBR was a municipally owned bus company in Trondheim, Norway between 1951 and 1974. It was merged with the tram operators Trondheim Sporvei and A/S Graakalbanen in 1974 to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap. It is now part of Team Trafikk, a subsidiary of Nettbuss. - Bombardier Transportation is the rail equipment division of the Canadian firm Bombardier Inc.

Bombardier Transportation has many minor production and development facilities worldwide. - Nettbuss AS is the largest bus company in Norway, owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). It was established on 10 February 2000 as the continuation of the bus operations from former NSB Biltrafikk. In addition to bus services in major parts of Norway, it also operates buses in Sweden through subsidiaries. - Trondheim Sporvei was a municipally owned tram operator in Trondheim, Norway that existed between 1936 and 1974. The company operated the municipal parts of the Trondheim Tramway until it was merged with A/S Graakalbanen and Trondheim Bilruter to create Trondheim Trafikkselskap. That company has become part of Nettbuss, the largest Norwegian bus company in Norway which is owned by Norwegian State Railways (\\"Norges Statsbaner AS\\"). - The Trondheim Tramway in Trondheim, Norway, is the world's most northerly tramway system, following the closure and dismantling of the Arkhangelsk tramways in Russia. It consists of one 8.8-km-long line, the Gråkallen Line, running from St. Olav's Gate in the city centre through Byåsen to Lian Station in Bymarka. - TS Class 6 was a series of 28 trams and 15 trailers built by Strømmens Værksted for Trondheim Sporvei . They were delivered in two slightly different batches ; ten in 1948 -- 49 and six in 1955 . On 10 October 1956 , almost all operative trams used by the company were lost to the flames . Subsequently , Trondheim Sporvei ordered the Class 6 from Strømmen . Five engines were salvaged from the fire , and were reused in trams 1 through 5 . The remaining deliveries were numbered 10 -- 32 . The trams delivered with new motors , had four NEBB motors with a power output of 43 kW ( 58 hp ) . The Class 6 remained in service until 1984 , when the Class 8 was delivered . Until then , the Class 7 served as the only tram on the Trondheim Tramway . Four trams and one trailer have been preserved by the Trondheim Tramway Museum . - Trondheim Trafikkselskap or TT was the city public transport company for Trondheim, Norway between 1974 and 2001. It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988. The company was owned by the city council. - Electrification is the process of powering by electricity and is usually associated with changing over from another power source. The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology and economic history, usually applies to a region or national economy. Broadly speaking, electrification was the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the change over from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors. - Norges Statsbaner AS, trading as NSB AS and known in English as the Norwegian State Railways, is a government-owned railway company which operates most passenger train services in Norway. Owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, it is also engaged in real estate through Rom Eiendom, bus transport through Nettbuss, cargo trains through CargoNet and Swedish train transport through Tågkompaniet.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Trondheim, historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.

Write a title for this article: Getting back on the horse…I mean course After my injury during a training run ahead of a World Cup event in Val d'Isère, France, the first phone call I made was to my parents. The first thing my mom said, after a long deep breath of shock as she knew my dream of competing in a home Olympics — the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games — was over, was “thank God it wasn’t your head.” At the end of the day, it is just a knee, and everyone comes back from ACL injuries, right? Well, sadly, I had a more serious injury than I had expected. It was a full dislocation rupturing my ACL, MCL, PCL, fracturing my tibial plateau, with IT-Band coming off with bone, and losing all the articular cartilage under my knee cap. It took three surgical procedures to put me back together. Still, I got back and raced World Cup downhill again. How did I feel the first time I got in the gate to race? Remarkably normal, this is what I did after all. I felt good, calm, and aggressive. Although I’d never faced such an intense injury of my own, mentally, I’d overcome the injuries of countless other athletes to push out of the gate, so I was well practised by the time I did it for myself. Once I reached the finish line of my first race back, a World Cup in St. Moritz, Switzerland, I did what I always did. I looked up to the scoreboard to see how I fared. I wasn’t very fast, and just as I was about to sulk, I lifted my head… My peers, friends, and the stands full of fans, were cheering and clapping as hard as if I’d won. They knew the work it had taken to get there, to be competing again. It was a beautiful moment, and one I’m thankful to have experienced.
