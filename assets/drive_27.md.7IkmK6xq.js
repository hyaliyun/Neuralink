You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — In the face of a storm of controversy and a slew of challengers, U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election. This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican. \\"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening. Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using 84,000 in taxpayer funds. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement. The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold. The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination. Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \\"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\\" All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career. Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary. Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C. Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign. Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment. Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out. But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior. In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation. Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble. Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest. A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\\" And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson. “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.” “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.” Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Photo: Handout Photo Photo: Handout Photo Image 1 of / 59 Caption Close U.S. Rep. Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \\"sexualized commentary\\" in his Capitol Hill office. The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint. ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office. Now Playing: Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress. Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for 84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay. Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \\"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\\" she said on CNN Thursday. Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit. Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican. Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \\"poor performance.\\" Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint. Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold. SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation. Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing. The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now. \\"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case. After details of their 84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute. But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March. Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact. In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \\"sexual fantasies\\" and \\"wet dreams\\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her. Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \\"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\\" Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \\"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\\" Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \\"anger issues.\\" She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized. Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter. According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \\"differently.\\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \\"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\\" The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \\"nothing to add.\\" In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \\"independent investigative team\\" to address the two women's concerns. \\"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement. \\"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\\" Daniels said. Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \\"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\\" Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \\"full compliance with office policy and the law.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’” Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said. As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an 84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation. A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work. ||||| Summary:","completion":"US Rep.

What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different aspects of a rental situation. The first question is about the obligations of a tenant who has signed an 11-month rental agreement, while the second question pertains to the potential disadvantages faced by the house owner if a rental agreement is made for a period longer than 11 months. Question 1: Is it mandatory to stay for 11 months in a rented house if the rental agreement was made for 11 months? Answer: It is not mandatory for a tenant to stay in a rented house for the entire duration of an 11-month rental agreement. However, the agreement serves as a legally binding contract between the landlord and the tenant that stipulates the terms of the tenancy, including the duration of the lease and the conditions for lease termination. While it is not mandatory to stay for the entire lease term, it is expected that both parties honor the agreement and its terms. In the event that a tenant wishes or needs to vacate the premises before the 11 months are up, proper communication with the landlord is essential. Tenants should review the lease terms and identify specific conditions that deal with early termination of the lease. Typically, there may be an early termination clause that may require the tenant to provide notice in advance or pay a termination fee, which could be equivalent to one or two months' rent. However, the specifics of notice period and termination fee may vary depending on the rental agreement. Question 2: What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Answer: A rental agreement for a period of more than 11 months may impose certain disadvantages on the house owner, though these disadvantages may vary depending on the regulations and laws of the specific jurisdiction. Some potential disadvantages may include the following: 1. Legal and tax implications: In certain jurisdictions, rental agreements longer than 11 months are considered long-term leases and may have different legal, tax, and stamp duty obligations than short-term leases. This may involve extra paperwork and result in higher taxation. 2. Lower flexibility: A longer lease term can limit the landlord's flexibility in adjusting rent according to changing market conditions or their own financial needs. If the rental market is experiencing growth, it may be more difficult for the landlord to increase rents if they are locked into a long-term lease agreement. 3. Difficulty in evicting problematic tenants: If a lease term is longer than 11 months, the house owner may face more difficulties in evicting a problematic tenant. Long-term lease agreements may offer stronger legal protections for tenants, making it harder for landlords to resolve issues without resorting to time-consuming and costly court proceedings. 4. Reduced ability to sell or renovate: A long-term rental agreement may limit the house owner's ability to renovate, sell, or move back into the property if circumstances change. Longer leases can complicate the selling process, especially if potential buyers want vacant possession of the property. It is important to note that these disadvantages are not universal, as laws and regulations vary between jurisdictions. House owners should consult with local legal and real estate professionals to understand the implications of a specific rental agreement term in their area."},{"prompt":"Given the question \\"Where will they have something to eat?\\" and the answer \\"In a nearby restaurant.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Living in a small town in Nevada, he spends his days working as a mechanic and his nights partaking in underground street races, holding an unbroken winning streak. One day, as Jack is working on his 1968 Ford Mustang, an anonymous letter arrives in the mail. It's an invitation for him to participate in The Royale Race, a prestigious, yet dangerously illegal racing event where the greatest drivers from around the world come to compete, with bets placed by international billionaires. The winner of this race will take home a cash grand prize of 10 million. The location of the race changes each year, and it is only revealed to those who are invited. This year, the race will take place in the breathtaking Swiss Alps within the next month. Seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Jack begins training rigorously to sharpen his driving skills. He visits his estranged older brother, Bobby, to seek guidance from an experienced racer. Bobby agrees to help and together, they prepare Jack and his Mustang for the treacherous terrain of the Alps. As the day of the race approaches, Jack learns of a cunning rival racer and the reigning champion, Victor Maverick. Victor only participates in the race under an alias which is rumored to be a famous name from the racing world. This year, the mysterious racer is rumored to use the name of Roger Moore. Jack, after considering different strategic moves, decides to take up the false identity of Roger Moore and register under it. He believes that by stealing his rival's alias, it will unnerve and intimidate Victor to think an even more skillful racer has taken his place. Jack starts referring to himself and signs into the race under the name of Roger Moore. The day of the race arrives, and the participants are introduced. Under the alias of Roger Moore, Jack lines up at the starting line with the rest of the racers, anxiously waiting for the green flag. Victor Maverick takes notice of \\"Roger Moore\\" and feels the pressure and frustration boiling inside. The race begins, and the competitors speed through the treacherous twists and turns of the Swiss Alps. The anxiety, skill, and intensity only escalate with each passing mile. Jack faces numerous challenges along the way – sabotages by rival racers, extreme weather conditions, and deceptive shortcuts that lead to dangerous drop-offs. However, his determination and brotherly bond with Bobby fuel his unwavering focus. As the finish line approaches, the rivalry between Jack and Victor reaches its culmination. A fierce duel between their vehicles leads to Victor losing control and crashing, leaving Jack ahead of the pack. Jack crosses the finish line first, claiming the title and the grand prize. In the aftermath, Jack reveals his true identity as Jack Goldfarb, earning the respect of the fellow racers, international racing community, and fans. He uses the prize money to build a better life for himself and his brother while pledging to race under his own name from that point onwards, becoming a true icon in the world of racing. The Race: Goldfarb's Gambit becomes a thrilling tale of ambition, strategy, deception, and the power of family bonds, with Jack realizing that his true identity is far more valuable than any alias."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review has a mixed opinion of the movie.

Write an article based on this summary: A scaffolder who had to have his leg and hands amputated after suffering an electric shock has had a further operation to remove his left foot.","completion":"Title: The Perseverance of a Scaffolder: Overcoming Challenges with Strength and Resilience Introduction On any given workday, scaffolders face dangerous and challenging circumstances to ensure that buildings and other structures are accessible and secure for construction work. Electrical hazards are often a common risk in their line of work, accounting for a considerable number of injuries and fatalities. In this article, we will focus on the personal journey of a scaffolder who had to have his leg and hands amputated after suffering an unfortunate electric shock and how he dealt with the additional surgery to remove his left foot. The Incident The scaffolder, known for his strong work ethic and commitment to his trade, was going about his usual tasks on a construction site. The job required him to handle metal rods that served as structural frameworks for the building. Unbeknownst to him, an exposed high-voltage wire had come into dangerously close proximity to his workspace. When disaster struck, the scaffolder's world changed in an instant. In an unfortunate split second, an electrical current surged through his body as he inadvertently made contact with the exposed wire. His co-workers responded quickly, alerting emergency services and trying to provide first aid until the professionals arrived at the scene. The man was rushed to the hospital, where doctors assessed and treated his extensive injuries. Amputation and Recovery Despite the best efforts of the medical team, it became evident that the severity of his injuries would require the amputation of his leg and both his hands. The life-changing injuries were undoubtedly devastating to both the scaffolder and his family. But, through strong inner strength and unwavering determination, he began the long process of healing and rehabilitation. The scaffolder's story garnered attention and support from friends, family, and even strangers. People donated generously to a fund established in his name, which allowed the man to receive the best care possible during his recovery. His story also brought attention to the importance of maintaining a safe working environment, emphasizing the significance of preventive measures to mitigate the risks associated with electrical hazards. The Additional Surgery Regrettably, unforeseen complications led to the need for further surgery. In a cruel twist of fate, the scaffolder had to face the amputation of his left foot as well. As he braced himself for another physically and emotionally traumatic procedure, his unwavering resilience remained intact. Life After Amputation Throughout his entire ordeal, the scaffolder has showcased incredible fortitude. Instead of succumbing to despair, he faced his challenges head-on and learned how to adapt to a world that he now navigates with the help of prosthetic limbs and adaptive devices. He is determined to make the most of his life, using his experiences as a platform to raise awareness about the dangers faced by those in his trade and the steps that can be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring. Conclusion The scaffolder's story serves as a stark reminder of the hazards faced by those in the construction industry and the grave consequences that can result from inadequate safety measures. His journey is one of remarkable resilience and determination, proving the indomitable strength of the human spirit. His story can be seen as an inspiration not only to his colleagues in the scaffolding world but also to anyone who has faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. It highlights how the unwavering support of loved ones, coupled with the power of sheer grit and determination, can help one overcome even the most daunting of obstacles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Coal cannot be grinded happens, how will it affect HURTING owls to hunt at night. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that coal cannot be grinded does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of owls hunting at night. Owls' hunting behavior is primarily influenced by biological and environmental factors, such as their highly developed senses of hearing and vision, and the availability of prey in their habitat. The grinding of coal is an unrelated industrial process that does not have any direct connection to owls or their hunting behavior. While it is possible that coal mining and related activities could have indirect effects on some owls through habitat destruction or pollution, the specific scenario of coal not being grindable does not influence owls' ability to hunt at night. Instead, it is more likely that changes to the habitats or ecosystems where owls live would impact their hunting behavior, rather than a specific industrial process like coal grinding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next, we need to isolate the term with v, so we will subtract 399 from both sides of the equation. -2413 - 399 = -74v + 399 - 399 4. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -2812 = -74v 5. Now, to solve for v, we will divide both sides of the equation by -74. -2812 / -74 = -74v / -74 6.

Choices: - dwelling - apartment - at hotel - condo - loft The rationale to choose \\"dwelling\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"The correct answe is \\"dwelling.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"dwelling\\" as the answer is as follows: 1. In traditional context, a hermit is a person who willingly isolates themselves from society, often to seek a spiritual purpose or clarity through solitude. As a result, it is more probable for a hermit to live in a dwelling, which can be a small, simple shelter serving as a functional living space away from urban areas, rather than any other given options. 2. Options such as \\"apartment,\\" \\"at hotel,\\" \\"condo,\\" and \\"loft\\" indicate urban or suburban housing structures that are typically close to other occupants, specifically created for social interaction or at least regular encounters with neighbors and community members. This is in direct contrast to the hermit's intended lifestyle and living arrangement. 3. The given question highlights that the hermit's living space is located \\"on the hill.\\" This geographical context reinforces the idea of the hermit seeking seclusion in a natural environment. A hill is an unlikely place for an apartment, hotel, condo, or loft, making \\"dwelling\\" the most suitable option in this situation. In conclusion, considering the hermit's preference for solitude and seclusion in a natural environment, the most logical answer is \\"dwelling,\\" as it best aligns with the hermit's lifestyle, and the other options do not suit the desired living conditions or geographical context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ghouls relentlessly search for human flesh to consume and thrive upon. A group of unlikely heroes unites to uncover the origin and purpose of these unearthly beings to save the town from complete eradication. Act I: Whispering Creek, a peaceful town surrounded by thick forests, is home to families who have lived there for generations. Rowena, a young independent investigative journalist, moves to town after inheriting her late grandmother's house. Intrigued by the town's dark history, Rowena begins digging through dusty archives at the local library. She meets Oliver, a librarian with a keen interest in the town's folklore. One night, a series of disturbances are reported at the local cemetery. The town sheriff, Alex, hesitant to involve the eccentric outsiders, grudgingly asks for Rowena and Oliver's help. They soon discover that ghouls have risen from their slumber within the Earth's depths and have started feasting on human flesh. The first victim is discovered at the cemetery, horribly mutilated and drained of all life. Act II: As the gravity of the situation sets in, the town comes together under the leadership of Sheriff Alex to devise a plan to combat the ghouls. Local legends narrate the sealing of the ghouls long ago by a band of powerful mystics where they were trapped in the underground caverns, away from human contact. However, recent mining activities have unleashed the ghouls, awakening them from their dormant state. As the feast on human flesh continues, the ghouls grow more powerful and exhibit horrifying abilities to manipulate shadows and darkness. Rowena, Oliver, and Alex come across an ancient grimoire in her grandmother's belongings that contains crucial information regarding the ghoul's weaknesses and methods to reseal them. Meanwhile, tensions rise as townspeople start disappearing one by one, including the Mayor of Whispering Creek. Act III: Armed with the information from the grimoire, Rowena, Oliver, Alex, and a small group of remaining townspeople face the ghoulish horde during the night of the new moon, when the ghouls are at their weakest. The battle is brutal and unforgiving. The heroes use traditional methods such as holy water, sacred talismans, and incantations to weaken the ghouls. Melinda, a local medic, saves the day when she discovers that a rare herb found in the surrounding forests, 'lunarsbane,' weakens the ghouls when ingested and renders them vulnerable. With the help of a community effort, the majority of the ghouls are tracked down and eliminated. The spirits of the fallen town members are honored in a ceremony led by Oliver. However, a few of the strongest ghouls manage to escape into the night. Act IV: In a final stand, Rowena, Oliver, and Alex track down the remaining ghouls to their underground lair, where they discover the Mayor has become the 'Ghoul Master' - a human who has embraced the dark powers controlling the ghouls to take revenge on the town he felt had betrayed him. Through a combination of knowledge, bravery, and teamwork, the heroes defeat the ghouls and the Ghoul Master. Using the grimoire, they enact the sealing ritual, sacrificing a part of their own life force to ensure that the ghouls remain trapped for good. As the battle is won, the three heroes vow to keep the people of Whispering Creek safe from such evil in the future. The town begins to rebuild, grateful for the return of peace and relative normalcy. Rowena decides to call Whispering Creek her permanent home, and together with Oliver and Alex, they form an alliance to safeguard their community from any supernatural threats lurking in the shadows."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The super bout between Mayweather and","completion":"Manny Pacquiao in 2015 was a prime example of the negotiations and organization required from boxing promoters. In Mayweather's case, he was promoted by his own company, Mayweather Promotions, and Top Rank represented Pacquiao. Here are the steps that Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, would need to take to organize and market a fight in Nevada: 1. Identify the fighters: The first step is to identify the fighters who will be participating in the event. This includes considering their records, popularity, and potential draw for attracting viewers and ticket buyers. Based on these factors, Mayweather would select the fighters that would participate in the boxing event he wants to promote. 2. Secure the venue: With the fighters selected, Mayweather would need to book a venue for the event. In Las Vegas, popular options include the MGM Grand Garden Arena or the T-Mobile Arena. He would need to negotiate rental fees, event dates, and secure necessary permits. 3. Set the fight date: Scheduling the event date is crucial. It needs to be a date that works for the fighters, the venue, and ideally, does not conflict with other major sporting events that could deter viewers. Mayweather would coordinate with all parties to finalize an agreeable date for the fight. 4. Negotiate fighter contracts: As a promoter, Mayweather would need to negotiate and finalize contracts with the fighters. This includes determining fighter purses, the division of pay-per-view revenue, and other terms related to the event and fighter compensation. 5. Coordinate with sanctioning bodies: Mayweather would need to work with the Nevada Athletic Commission and the relevant boxing sanctioning organizations, such as the WBC or WBA, to ensure that the fight is sanctioned and abides by all necessary rules and regulations. 6. Marketing and promotion: With fighters, venue, and date confirmed, Mayweather would need to develop and execute a marketing strategy to promote the event. This could include creating promotional materials such as posters, promotional videos, and press releases, as well as coordinating press conferences or media days for additional exposure. 7. Event logistics: Mayweather, as a promoter, would be responsible for handling all event logistics, such as hiring staff and providing security, ticket sales, and accommodations for fighters and their teams. Promoters also arrange for important services like medical staff, ring announcers, and referees. 8. Insure fighters and testing: Mayweather would need to have all fighters insured against injury, as well as arrange and pay for any necessary drug testing as required by the sanctioning bodies. 9. Post-event: After the event, Mayweather would be responsible for any post-fight tasks, such as settling any financial matters, paying fighters and staff, and filing required reports with the Nevada Athletic Commission. By following these steps, Floyd Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, can effectively organize and market a fight event in Nevada and create memorable moments for fight fans worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Sands of Iwo Jima Context: Note: the story is told from the viewpoint of Cpl. Robert Dunne (Arthur Franz). Tough-as-nails career Marine Sergeant John Stryker (John Wayne) is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by PFC. Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway (John Agar), the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC. Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), who blames him for his demotion. When Stryker leads his squad in the invasion of Tarawa, the men begin to appreciate his methods, except Conway, who considers him brutal and unfeeling when he apparently abandons a wounded comrade to the enemy. Within the first couple of minutes of the battle, the platoon leader, Lt. Baker (Gil Herman, is killed only seconds after he lands on the beach, PFC. \\"Farmer\\" Soames (James Holden) is wounded in the leg, and PFC. Choynski (Hal Baylor) receives a head wound. The marines are aggressively pinned down by a pillbox. As a result of three unsuccessful attempts to reach the pillbox, two demolition marines and a flamethrower operator are killed and PFC. Shipley (Richard Webb) is left mortally wounded in the line of fire. Sgt. Stryker takes action and demolishes the pillbox. Shipley would eventually die of his wounds in front of his best friend Regazzi (Wally Cassell).

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima,\\" which tells the story from the viewpoint of Cpl. Robert Dunne, the narrative follows a group of Marines led by the tough Sergeant John Stryker. His rigorous training methods make him unpopular among the squad, especially with PFC. Peter Conway and PFC. Al Thomas. The movie showcases the battle in Tarawa, where the men slowly realize the importance of Stryker's training methods throughout various challenging situations. However, the question asks for the number of Japanese that must be battled in Iwo Jima. The movie portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima as one of the most significant battles in which the Marines participate. This battle was an actual historical event that took place between February 19, 1945, and March 26, 1945, involving the United States and Japan. The Japanese forces present on the island of Iwo Jima consisted of approximately 21,000 men. These forces were primarily located in hidden bunkers and tunnels throughout the island, making it a well-fortified defense point. The American forces invading the island consisted of around 70,000 Marines. In the movie, the events leading up to the Battle of Iwo Jima are focused on the Marines and their training, rather than providing an exact count of the Japanese forces they would come up against in battle. During the battle itself, the squad led by Sergeant Stryker would likely face numerous Japanese soldiers, but the movie does not provide specific numbers. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to the question regarding how many Japanese must be battled in Iwo Jima based solely on the context of the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima.\\" In real-life events, the U.S. Marines faced around 21,000 Japanese soldiers, but it is important to note that this figure applies to the overall battle and not specifically to the squad depicted in the movie."},{"prompt":"This article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets.

The review highlights two key things: it is affectionately goofy and a satire. Let's deconstruct these elements for a better understanding: 1. Affectionately goofy - The use of the word \\"affectionately\\" suggests that the movie has a certain warmth and that the goofiness is endearing and charming to the viewer. Goofy refers to the silly, lighthearted humor present in the movie. By stating that the movie is affectionately goofy, the critic implies that they enjoyed the humor and appreciated the warmhearted approach to it. 2. Satire - Satire is a genre of film and literature that uses humor, irony, or exaggeration to criticize or expose the flaws and follies of a particular subject, often focusing on politics, social issues, or human vices. By mentioning the movie is a satire, the critic acknowledges that the film has a deeper meaning and intent behind its humor, challenging the audience to think critically about the subject matter. Considering both of these components, it is evident that the critic sees value and enjoyment in the movie. They perceive it as a humorous, lighthearted satire that strikes a balance between entertaining the audience and making them think about a specific topic.

Analyzing the question: The question presents an event (coup-de-etat) that happens with the aim of modifying society. We need to determine the appropriate response or outcome from the given options. 2. Examining each option: - Happiness for: Happiness as a result of a coup is potentially vague and not directly connected to the transformation of society. - New laws: While new laws can be part of the societal change process, they are not the primary driving force by themselves. - Protest: Protests can lead to change, but they are not an outcome or result in the context of a coup-de-etat seeking societal change. - Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat often involves the removal of existing leaders and the establishment of new ones. This factor could significantly impact societal change and aligns with the given context. - Cultural revolution: Although a cultural revolution can lead to changes in society, it is typically broader in nature and not a direct consequence of a coup-de-etat specifically aimed to change society. 3. Justifying the choice: Upon examining and comparing the options, \\"change in leadership\\" is most closely related to a coup-de-etat aimed at transforming society. New leadership can initiate the necessary changes through policymaking and decision-making, enabling the desired societal changes to take place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Specifically, the question addresses the complexities of the relationships between Susan, Graham, Menetti, and other characters while they cope with the uncertainty of Alex's disappearance. Analyzing Susan's character, we can observe how she faces public scrutiny and criticism for allowing her son to walk to school alone. Despite this pressure, she remains determined to find her son and navigates the emotionally challenging situation by cooperating with the authorities and facing media attention. Her resilience and hope throughout the investigation reveal her character's strength and highlight how she bears the emotional burden of being a mother searching for her missing child. Graham, Susan's estranged husband, copes with the guilt of not being present for his son's life and tries to take matters into his own hands by investigating the ransom call. His vigilante-like actions and subsequent hospitalization further strain his relationship with Susan and the authorities, specifically Lieutenant Menetti. However, these events also demonstrate his need to find a sense of control in the face of uncertainty and the emotional weight of the situation. Lieutenant Menetti, the central figure of the investigation, experiences mounting pressure in the form of time constraints, budget cuts, and competing caseloads while attempting to solve the Selky case. Menetti's prioritization of Alex's disappearance displays his commitment to helping Susan find closure, even as his resources are limited and priorities shift to new cases. His character embodies the persistence and determination of police officers in solving such mysteries. In conclusion, exploring the emotions and dynamics of the main characters in the film, in the context of Alex's disappearance, allows for a deep understanding of how grief, guilt, and uncertainty impact the characters' lives and decisions. Moreover, it emphasizes the human element in such tragic circumstances and highlights how people cope with adversity and seek closure and answers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter. A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Carson gave Addison a piece of his mind after she stood him up. And I was wondering Why did Carson do this? Answer:","completion":"Carson's decision to give Addison a piece of his mind after she stood him up is rooted in a variety of factors, which can include the following emotional, social, and even psychological reasons: 1. Disappointment and hurt: Carson likely felt disappointed and hurt by Addison's act of standing him up. When someone is looking forward to spending time with another person and that person unexpectedly doesn't show up, it is natural to feel let down. Giving Addison a piece of his mind might have been Carson's way to express his hurt emotions and convey the impact of her action on him. 2. Confrontation of disrespectful behavior: Standing someone up is considered disrespectful, as it disregards their time and efforts to meet up. Carson might have thought it was important to address the situation and communicate his feelings about her disrespectful behavior. By doing so, he may have hoped to prevent such incidents from happening in the future and maintain better communication between them. 3. Reestablishing boundaries: When someone doesn't follow through with their plans, it can make the other person question the trust and boundaries within the relationship. By addressing Addison's behavior, Carson might have tried to reestablish clear boundaries and expectations about what is and isn't acceptable in their relationship. 4. Assertiveness and self-respect: Carson might have felt the need to be assertive and stand up for himself. Doing so can help maintain one's self-respect and ensure that others understand that their time and feelings are valuable. Confronting Addison about her act of standing him up may have allowed Carson to express that he respects his own worth and would not tolerate such behavior without addressing it. 5. Encouraging communication and understanding: By voicing his concerns, Carson aimed to open the lines of communication with Addison and seek clarity on why she stood him up. By understanding and addressing the reasons behind her actions, both parties would have the opportunity to work through any issues and improve their relationship. 6. Catharsis and emotional release: Sometimes, expressing one's feelings about a disappointing or hurtful situation can provide relief and aid in healing. By openly discussing the incident with Addison, Carson may have experienced a sense of closure or relief from the emotions that were triggered by her standing him up. In conclusion, Carson's decision to give Addison a piece of his mind was likely driven by various factors that include emotional hurt, asserting self-respect, confronting and discouraging disrespectful behavior, reestablishing boundaries within the relationship, opening lines of communication, and seeking catharsis from the whole incident. Different people react differently to similar situations depending on their personality, past experiences, and expectations. It is important to remember that establishing clear communication and understanding between individuals can help resolve conflicts and nurture healthier relationships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lisa Marie was born on February 1, 1968, to Elvis and Priscilla Presley at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, nine months to the day after her parents' May 1, 1967, wedding. After her parents divorced, she lived with her mother. When her father died in 1977, 9-year-old Lisa Marie became joint heir to his estate with her grandfather Vernon Presley and her great-grandmother Minnie Mae Presley. Following the deaths of Vernon in 1979 and Minnie Mae in 1980, she became the sole heir and inherited Graceland. Lisa Marie Presley was indoctrinated into the Church of Scientology in 1977 by her mother, Priscilla. Priscilla had discovered books pertaining to Scientology among the belongings of her ex-husband, Elvis Presley, after his death on August 16, 1977. In October 1997, Presley, along with friend and fellow Memphian and Scientologist Isaac Hayes, opened the Literacy, Education and Ability Program (LEAP). LEAP is run by Applied Scholastics, a group run by Scientologists. On January 5, 2002, Presley received the Humanitarian Award from the World Literacy Crusade for her efforts to help children across America learn valuable skills for study and improve their lives. Lisa Marie Presley received her award from Isaac Hayes, Chaka Khan and Yolanda King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr. World Literacy Crusade is regarded by critics as a front group for the Church of Scientology.

That cute idea of making a “Will You Marry Me?” ugly Christmas sweater with the ring literally sewn into place above your heart simply won’t do. Why not? It’s all thanks to Yasushi Takahashi, an artist who quit his job in 2008, trekked across Japan with a GPS tracker, and used his travels to spell out a 4,451-mile long proposal.

Options: + chance level; + motion; + vector count; + entropy; Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Scientists use a quantity called __________ as a measure of disorder, or randomness. A: A:","completion":"Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, it provides a way to quantify the amount of disorder present in a system. It was first introduced by the physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics states that in an isolated system, natural processes tend to progress in a direction that leads to an increase in disorder or randomness, also known as an increase in entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations a system can have, given its macroscopic properties such as temperature, volume, and energy. In simpler terms, it accounts for the variety of ways particles can be arranged or distributed among individual energy levels. A system with a low entropy value has only a few possible states, which means the particles are organized and structured. On the other hand, a system with a high entropy value has many possible states, which means the particles are disordered and less structured. It is crucial to note that entropy is not an inherent property of an object or a system, but rather depends on the observer's choice of macroscopic variables to describe the system. In this sense, an increase in entropy can be understood as an increase in the amount of information needed to describe a system fully. In practical applications, entropy often helps scientists and engineers understand and predict various processes that involve the transfer of heat, such as heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and heat pumps. It can also be applied in other fields, including information theory, where entropy represents the minimum amount of data required to transmit a message optimally, and in the study of complex systems, where entropy can describe the level of uncertainty or instability present in those systems. Overall, entropy is a crucial concept that allows scientists to quantify and analyze the degree of disorder in various systems. By understanding and predicting the way systems evolve from order to chaos, researchers can better understand the fundamental properties of our universe and develop more effective technologies for harnessing and controlling energy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script--the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas--as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. Context: The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines. During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown. Question: Was there a population of these cities? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there was a population in the cities of the Maya civilization during the Preclassic period. The development of sedentary communities, establishment of settlements, and growth of small villages into cities, as seen with Nakbe, El Mirador, and Tikal, are indications that there were populations inhabiting these cities. These populations engaged in agriculture, cultivating staple crops, and participated in the cultural aspects such as the creation of pottery, fired clay figurines, and the development of the early Maya script."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steps to address this question: 1. Research the ownership and copyright of the Pac-man character. 2. Determine if there are any licensing options available for using the character. 3. Consult legal resources or professionals to confirm the possibility of using the character in a personal game project without violating copyright. Question 2: \\"Can anyone get any government college through MAT?\\" This question is related to education, specifically asking about the possibility of securing admission in a government college by means of the Management Aptitude Test (MAT) scores. Steps to address this question: 1. Identify the government colleges that accept MAT scores during their admission process. 2. Understand minimum score requirements and other eligibility criteria at the respective colleges. 3. Research the admission process of the selected colleges and prepare accordingly. Since both questions talk about unrelated subjects: one about using a character in their game while the other one about college admissions via an aptitude test, they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Article: If you struggle to feel secure in a relationship, practice good communication skills. Ask people to speak directly and honestly to you without using sarcasm. When you speak with others, put most of your energy on listening to what they say and understanding them. If you're unclear about something, ask a question. Overall, be curious in your interactions and avoid jumping to conclusions. If you start to doubt what the person is doing or saying, ask a question. However, don't be accusing. For example, if your partner is going out and you're feeling suspicious, ask, “Do you know what time you'll be back? I was hoping we could spend some time together tonight.” If you generally tend to be untrusting toward people, this likely affects your ability to have friendships and relationships. While it's true some people shouldn't be trusted, it doesn't mean that everyone is not trustworthy. Think about what it costs you when you doubt someone; their time, their presence, their love, and perhaps even their friendship. For example, if someone calls and says they will be late, then it simply means they are running late and nothing more. Even if there is a pattern of lateness, it doesn't mean they're up to something else based solely on this one trait, however much you dislike it. If you're having a hard time believing someone, say to yourself, “I am choosing to believe they are telling me the truth.” Maybe an ex cheated on you and now you're wary of dating or being with someone new for fear they may also betray you. Living in the past is not a healthy way to direct your present and future behavior. Avoid letting past bad experiences cloud your present judgment, and learn how to stop yourself from falling into automatic suspicious responses whenever a similar situation arises. Rebuilding trust starts with you, not anybody else. Learn from your past experiences and improve your resilience, but use the past like a stepping stone rather than a weight dragging you down.

Orlando City SC were an American professional soccer team based in Orlando, Florida, United States that was the precursor to Orlando City SC. The team played in USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer pyramid from 2010 to 2014, until discontinuing in favor of Orlando's Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise in 2015 which is owned by the same principals. Can we draw the following conclusion? Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015. The team initially known as Orlando City Soccer Club, played in the USL Pro, which was the third tier of the American soccer pyramid from 2010 to 2014. Orlando City SC was the precursor to the Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise, which was established in Orlando in 2015. The founders and ownership group behind Orlando City SC had ambitions to bring professional soccer to a higher level, and they saw the MLS as the right platform for this goal. The MLS launched an expansion initiative in the early 2010s, and Orlando City SC actively pursued a spot in the top-tier league. The ownership group, led by Flavio Augusto da Silva and Phil Rawlins, worked diligently to secure the necessary financial and political commitments, including plans for a new soccer-specific stadium in downtown Orlando. Eventually, the efforts of the ownership group paid off. In November 2013, MLS Commissioner Don Garber announced that Orlando City SC would become the league's 21st franchise, set to begin its first MLS season in 2015. The transition from USL Pro to MLS meant radical changes to the organization, including a new team roster and a rebranding effort in terms of identity and team colors. This rebranding marked the end of the previous Orlando City SC and led to the birth of the new MLS franchise team under the same name. Therefore, with the ambitions of playing in the top-tier league being realized through the establishment of the Major League Soccer expansion franchise, the previous version of Orlando City SC that had competed in the USL Pro from 2010 to 2014 no longer existed and was effectively dissolved in 2015. The current Orlando City SC that plays in the MLS is structurally different from the earlier version, although the name and some core elements have been retained in order to maintain continuity and build upon the growing fan base and soccer community in Orlando."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the given premise, it is essential to analyze the structure and logical relationship between both statements. Let's first break down the premise and hypothesis to understand them better. Premise: \\"As the UAW (United Auto Workers) members at Caterpillar have learned, if the stakes are high enough, Wall Street can be very, very patient.\\" - This statement suggests that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned that Wall Street can display immense patience when the stakes are high. Hypothesis: \\"The UAW members at Caterpillar learned nothing.\\" - This statement contradicts the premise and implies that the UAW members at Caterpillar have not learned anything. In the context of logical reasoning, a conclusion can be derived when the premise leads to or supports the validity of the hypothesis. In this case, we can observe that the premise and the hypothesis are in direct opposition to each other. The premise affirms that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned about Wall Street's patience, while the hypothesis negates this idea by claiming that they have learned nothing. Given the contradictory nature of the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.

Title: Bleh, sigh, ugh Review: Well, I love listening to books on CD during my commute. Frankly, I can't decide after 4 of the 10 CDs included in this package whether I should continue to listen or not. The reader's voice -- C.J. Critt -- is really irritating. Her inflection on certain words doesn't work and the voices she uses for some of the characters are so off-putting. After being almost halfway through, I really would like to know what happened to this AP reporter/scuba diver, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting through 6 more CDs.

They sold their apartment and moved to a new house after she got pregnant because the apartment was too small. With a new family member on the way, they needed more space not only for the baby's room, but also to accommodate friends and family who would surely come to visit the newest addition to their family. Step 1: Assessing their needs regarding space and amenities. Before making any decisions, they carefully assessed their needs and determined that a house with a minimum of three bedrooms, a spacious living area, and a yard would be ideal. Step 2: Setting a budget. Budgeting was crucial to ensure they could afford a new home without incurring too much debt. They took into account their current savings, monthly income, and the potential costs involved in raising a child. Step 3: Researching potential neighborhoods. They researched various neighborhoods, considering factors like proximity to schools, safety, and community amenities such as parks and playgrounds. They wanted to ensure they chose a great place to raise their child. Step 4: Hiring a real estate agent. To streamline the home buying process, they hired a real estate agent who had expertise in the neighborhoods they were interested in. The agent helped them find a suitable home that met their requirements and budget. Step 5: Viewing multiple homes. Over the course of a few weeks, they visited several houses with their agent, carefully weighing the pros and cons of each property. They considered factors like room layout, potential for renovations, and the overall feel of the neighborhood. Step 6: Making an offer and negotiating. Once they found the perfect house for their growing family, they made an offer through their real estate agent. After some back-and-forth negotiations, the price was settled, and they signed a purchase agreement. Step 7: Securing financing. They applied for a mortgage, and, due to their solid credit history and financial stability, they were approved for a loan that covered the purchase price of the house. Step 8: Inspecting the house. Before closing the deal, they hired a professional home inspector to thoroughly evaluate the property and identify any potential issues. This ensured they wouldn't encounter any costly surprises down the road. Step 9: Closing the deal and moving in. After all necessary inspections and paperwork were completed, they closed on the house and began the moving process. They packed up their belongings from the apartment and hired a moving company to transport everything to their new home. Step 10: Settling into their new home and preparing for the baby. After moving in and unpacking, they began nesting for the arrival of their baby. They set up a cozy nursery and started purchasing all essential baby items.

Pte James Farrell, 18, said he was only trying to warn Rifleman Curtis Horbury during the incident at Catterick Garrison, in North Yorkshire. But a court martial last month in Colchester heard the blow was aimed at his colleague's head. Farrell, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, was convicted of attempted murder. The court heard claims that Mr Horbury was the \\"ringleader\\" of a gang of trainees who were bullying Farrell, which had culminated in the attack on 13 November. Farrell said he had no intention of hitting him with the knife and just wanted to scare him to make him leave him alone. He said on the night in question he was verbally bullied and went out to a smoking area to calm down, but \\"lost it\\" when he came back and saw Mr Horbury \\"smirking\\" at him. The court heard \\"it was only by chance\\" Mr Horbury was not killed. He managed to dodge the blow by rolling out of the way. Sentencing Farrell at Colchester Garrison, Vice-Judge Advocate General Michael Hunter told him: \\"You reacted in the way you did because you were being verbally bullied and because you couldn't take it.\\" Describing it as an \\"unusual\\" case in which nobody was injured, he said: \\"Following that blow, instead of retrieving the knife and continuing your actions you took no further action. \\"You did nothing.

Make this lower case","completion":"these revolutionary developments open up new possibilities in the field of additive manufacturing. Revolutionary developments in the field of additive manufacturing have opened up a plethora of new possibilities and opportunities. Additive manufacturing, also commonly known as 3D printing, has been transforming industries with its innovative techniques that allow for more efficient and customized production. A traditional manufacturing process involves cutting, shaping, and assembling materials to create a finished product, often resulting in a significant amount of waste. On the other hand, additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer by depositing materials precisely where they are needed, thus reducing waste and improving efficiency. There are several key developments in additive manufacturing that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible: 1. Advanced materials: The introduction of new and improved materials has allowed for an expansion of applications, making it possible to create stronger and lightweight products. Materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, metal alloys, and even biodegradable materials are now being used in 3D printing, unlocking a wide range of potential uses. 2. Multi-material printing: 3D printers are now capable of processing multiple materials in one build, thus creating objects with a diverse set of properties. This development has opened up new opportunities in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medicine, where the combination of materials can be used to create more effective products. 3. Improved accuracy and resolution: Technological advancements in the printing process have led to higher levels of precision and resolution in the final product. This development is especially significant in industries like aerospace, where minute details make a significant difference in terms of safety, performance, and efficiency. 4. Faster production: Innovations in the additive manufacturing process have resulted in a considerable decrease in production time. With the development of printers that can create objects at an exceedingly rapid pace, it becomes much more feasible for companies to bring their products to market more quickly. 5. Mass customization: Additive manufacturing allows for greater customization without requiring additional time or costs, giving consumers tailored products at prices comparable to those of mass-produced items.

(By the way, you've been saying \\"Voldemort\\" incorrectly for years.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Donald Trump, who is known for his controversial statements and harsh comments on Twitter, found himself on the receiving end of criticism from renowned author, J.K. Rowling. In December 2015, Trump proposed a \\"total and complete shutdown\\" of Muslims entering the United States. This sparked outrage among many, and Twitter users began comparing Trump to the infamous villain, Lord Voldemort, from Rowling's Harry Potter series. In response to this comparison, Rowling took to Twitter to defend her fictional character by stating, \\"How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad.\\" The author's retort received ample support from her followers, with her comment being retweeted over 50,000 times in a matter of hours and garnering almost as many likes. The comparison between Trump and Lord Voldemort was drawn due to the perceived similarities between the two in terms of their ideologies and divisive tactics. Lord Voldemort is a character despised by many for his evil intentions, narcissism, and lust for power. Trump's controversial statements regarding Muslims, immigration, and other sensitive topics have generated similar sentiments among a portion of the population. Rowling's tweet not only highlighted the extreme nature of Trump's proposal but also served as a means for the author to remind her readers of the importance of tolerance and acceptance. Lord Voldemort, as portrayed within the Harry Potter series, was a figure who believed in the superiority of pure-blood wizards and sought to eradicate those who did not fit his criteria. Consequently, the comparison to Trump, who has been accused of aligning with right-wing extremist groups and promoting discriminatory policies, is seen as a criticism of his political stance. The reaction to Rowling's tweet underscores the power of social media as a platform for the exchange of ideas and opinions, as well as its ability to amplify messages from influential voices. As a result of her tweet, the debate surrounding Trump's proposed Muslim ban was further fueled, and the conversation around the issue expanded. One interesting side note from the Rowling tweet incident was the revelation that many have been mispronouncing \\"Voldemort\\" for years. In the aftermath of the tweet, it came to light that the \\"t\\" in Voldemort is silent, properly pronounced as \\"Vol-de-more.\\" Rowling confirmed this to be the correct pronunciation through her Twitter interactions. In conclusion, J.K. Rowling's public comparison between Donald Trump and her fictional character Lord Voldemort generated widespread discussion about the then-presidential candidate's controversial policies and rhetoric. Her tweet served to highlight the divisive nature of Trump's proposals, while at the same time reinforcing the importance of accepting and respecting others, a key theme in her Harry Potter books."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, she would want to locate her car as quickly and efficiently as possible. When a person is unable to locate their car in a parking garage, they might feel frustrated, worried, or even embarrassed. To help Tracy find her car, she could consider the following actions: 1. Retrace her steps: Tracy should try to remember the route she took to get out of the garage, including the floor and section she parked in. She may also recall any landmarks and nearby cars to help her get an idea of the general location of her car. 2. Look for signage: Most parking garages have clear signs indicating floor levels and section numbers. By checking the signs, Tracy can determine if she's on the correct floor or in the right section. 3. Use the car's alarm or key fob: If Tracy has a key fob with a panic button or an alarm feature, she can use it to trigger the alarm and listen for her car. However, this might be less helpful if the parking garage is too large or if there are any obstacles that interfere with the sound. 4. Ask for assistance: Many parking garages have staff or security personnel who might be able to help Tracy locate her car. They may also have access to security cameras that could provide information about her car's location. 5. Use a smartphone or technology: Some cars have integrated navigation systems, or alternatively, Tracy could use her smartphone to locate her car if she has recorded the parking spot earlier. This could include using GPS coordinates or having a parking app to help her find her car.

Another similar phrase is \\"felicidades en tu día,\\" meaning \\"congratulations on your day.\\" To wish someone a long life or many more birthdays, one can say \\"¡Que cumplas muchos más!\\" (kay KOOM-plahs MOO-chohs mahs), translating to \\"that you complete many more.\\" The birthday song in Latin America is sung to the familiar tune but with different lyrics.

First, let's look at the problem. It says: 0 = -588*j - 389*j + 9770 You see those two j's in there? We're trying to find out what number j is. So let's combine those j's together! If you have -588 of something and then you take away 389 more of that same thing, how many do you have? That's right! You have -588 - 389 of them, which equals -977 of the same thing (j). So, our problem now looks like this: 0 = -977*j + 9770 Now, let's get j all by itself. First, we want to get rid of that +9770. What's the opposite of adding 9770? Correct! The opposite is subtracting 9770. So we're going to subtract 9770 from both sides of the equation. When we do that, we have: -9770 = -977*j Now, to get j by itself, we need to divide both sides by -977. Can you tell me what happens when we divide -9770 by -977? Great job! When we divide -9770 by -977, we get 10. So, j is equal to 10! And there you have it! We solved the problem, and we found out that j = 10.

Article: London i/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London,[note 1] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2] The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London. The latter constitutes the vast majority of London, though historically it was split between Middlesex (a now abolished county), Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire. Question: What part of London constitutes the bulk of the city?","completion":"The part of London that constitutes the bulk of the city is the county of Greater London."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who suffers from a sleep disorder? ? College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant. In the sleep laboratory Dr Koslov shows her a protocol about her dream in which she is pursued. She denies having dreamed anything, but sees her signature on the form.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. the work on mars was essentially completed by 1605, but there were delays in getting the book published. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"The work on Mars was essentially completed by 1605, but there were delays in getting the book published. Although the work on Mars was completed by 1605, it took quite a while for the publication process to be completed. The reasons for these delays can be attributed to various factors, including challenges related to technological advancements, manuscript preparation, and the complex publication process of the time. During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the process of publishing a book was significantly more complicated and time-consuming than it is today. The printing press, while revolutionary, was still in its infancy. It required a significant amount of manual labor to set up and operate, and preparing the manuscript was a laborious task for both the author and the printer. After the author had completed his work on Mars, he had to prepare the manuscript in a format that would be suitable for publication. This involved producing a clean, legible copy, which was often handwritten. This step could take an extended period, depending on the length and complexity of the manuscript. Once the manuscript was prepared, the author needed to find a publisher willing to invest in the project. Given the cost associated with the printing process, publishers took a substantial financial risk with each book they printed. As a result, they often needed to be convinced of the value of the work. Securing a publisher's interest could often take much time and effort from the author. With a publisher on board, the process of actually printing the book began. Type was set by hand – an arduous and slow process. Printers had to create individual type for each character, including many different typefaces, and languages if necessary. This required not just expertise, but also patience and time dedication. After the type was set, the printer had to print multiple proofs of the book to ensure accuracy and quality. Each round of proofs needed to be checked by the author and, possibly, other experts working on the topic. As revisions were made, the type would often need to be reset entirely – further prolonging the process. Once the final proofs had been approved, the book could finally be printed. However, even at this stage, there were potential delays. The printing process itself could be slow, and if equipment broke down or supplies ran out, it took time to resolve these issues. Moreover, after the printing process, there was still the matter of binding the books. Books during this period were often hand-bound, which could be done in-house at the print shop or outsourced to other bookbinders. This added yet another layer of potential delays. When considering all of these factors, it is understandable that the completion of the work on Mars by 1605 doesn't mean the book was available to the public immediately. It may have taken several additional years for the book to be published and distributed due to the extensive and intricate process involved during that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? most important and exhilarating","completion":"In order to determine if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral, it's crucial to look at the context. However, based just on the phrase \\"most important and exhilarating,\\" one would generally align it with a positive sentiment. The term \\"important\\" on its own is neutral - neither positive nor negative. It just states the emphasis or priority on something, indicating its high value or significance, but in terms of sentiment, it is neutral; it doesn't express a good or bad feeling. However, the term \\"exhilarating\\" is often associated with a positive sentiment. It suggests a feeling of excitement, enthusiasm, and thrill. When something is described as \\"exhilarating,\\" it often generates a feeling of joy or anticipation. In the context of the terms together, \\"most important and exhilarating,\\" there’s almost an enhancement of the positivity due to the use of the term 'most'. The statement is not just labeling something as important and exhilarating, but the most important and exhilarating, which certainly emphasizes a very high degree of positivity due to the strength of the adjectives and the superlative ‘most’. Thus, although the phrase is lacking a fuller context to provide a complete certainty, based on the words given, it can be inferred that the sentiment is positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once the bacterial toxins have damaged the body cells, the immune system is triggered to counteract the bacterial infection. This includes the body increasing the production of white blood cells, antibodies, and other mechanisms that are designed to target and destroy the bacteria and their toxins.

Rahama Sadau's appearance in a music video where she was hugged by Nigerian pop star Classiq has led to her being banned from the Hausa-language film industry, known as Kannywood. The industry body, the Motion Picture Practitioners Association of Nigeria (Moppan), was responding to comments from many people including other Hausa actors. One of them, Nura Hussain, took to Instagram holding a sign calling for Ms Sadau's punishment. The picture got hundreds of comments supporting his demand. In Hausa culture, any open show of romance is frowned upon, and this was where Ms Sadau slipped up. But the actress also has her fans, some of whom have tried to fight back on social media setting up online groups to show their support. She herself has apologised to anyone she may have offended, but described what she did as \\"innocuous touching\\". And she seems less than remorseful, posting repeatedly on Snapchat a photo of herself being hugged by a man on her recent visit to India, where she was when the row erupted. A typical Kannywood film: As the film opens parents are seen discussing who their successful city-dwelling son should marry. They decide on a cousin who they deem meets all their expectations of a good wife. But there's a hitch, their urban, and urbane, son is in love with an educated city lady. He wants to marry her. The family confronts their son with their choice of wife for him. The dispute generates tension and finally the parents force their son to marry the cousin. He goes through with the wedding but stays in touch with his preferred partner. They go on romantic outings during which he mentions his loveless marriage. Throughout the film, dancing and singing punctuate the action. If there is to be any suggestion of sex, the screen will go dark. Ms Sadau speaks some Hindi, like many fans of Bollywood films in the mainly Muslim northern Nigeria where Indian cinema has been appreciated for years for its conservative values. Kannywood, which took off around 2000, is similar but more restrained. Its films would never go as far as Classiq's music video and show a man and a woman hugging, but even scenes showing young people expressing love towards each other have been deemed offensive by some. But this controversy has not emerged in a vacuum. Anger towards Kannywood actors and films has been building up for some time in Nigeria and the industry has been on the defensive. Islamic clerics in the north blame them for spreading immorality and bringing it into the home. Ms Sadau's video appearance proved their point. Parents say the films and the antics of the actors divert their children's attention from more important things. The recent problems can be traced back to 2010 when a video was leaked of a Hausa actress having sex with her boyfriend. Criticism from clerics has not let up. Earlier this year the government cancelled plans to build state-of-the-art film facilities in Kano state - from where the industry gets its name - after pressure from religious leaders, who said it would promote immorality. This is why the industry is keen to see that it is upholding a strict ethical code. And it appears as if Ms Sadau has been made an example of. Moppan said it hoped the ban would serve as a deterrent to other actors and actresses who are \\"expected to be good ambassadors of the society they represent\\". Its chairman, Muhammadu Kabiru Maikaba, told the BBC Hausa service that this \\"was not the first time that she has been doing these wayward things. We have been warning her, but she still went ahead to dent out image\\". What has happened to her has grabbed the attention as she is currently one of the best known faces of Kannywood. She emerged in 2013, featuring in films alongside the industry's big names, and became famous for being adventurous and daring in her films Her profile was raised further following commercial endorsements from various companies. In 2015, she was embroiled in a row after she accused popular actor Adam Zango of sexual harassment. Mr Zango denied the accusation. But this year's row may have topped that as she has come in for some vitriolic abuse. Some of Ms Sadau's defenders have said that she is being picked on because she is a woman. They point to pictures of Kannywood actors where they are seen hugging women and argue that they have not been castigated in a similar manner. The actress has urged people to calm down and said that people should be \\"more tolerant and forgiving towards one another and to cease the senseless abuse, name calling and backbiting\\". But this row, whatever the outcome, is unlikely to be the last time that morality and ethics get debated when it comes to Kannywood movies. With the proliferation of satellite channels showing Hausa films and smartphones on which people can download clips the battle between the vanguards of morality and Kannywood may have only just begun. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the controversy surrounding Nigerian actress Rahama Sadau after she appeared in a music video where she was hugged by Nigerian pop star Classiq.

In Hausa culture, open displays of romance are frowned upon, and many people, including fellow actors, called for Sadau's punishment.

Camilla is a member of the British royal family and is married to Charles, Prince of Wales, who is the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and heir apparent to the British throne. Camilla Rosemary Shand was born on July 17, 1947, in London, England, to Major Bruce Shand and The Hon. Rosalind Cubitt, the daughter of Roland Calvert Cubitt, the 3rd Baron Ashcombe. She grew up in a wealthy family, with strong connections to the British nobility and a long history of service in the Royal Air Force and British Army. Camilla met Prince Charles for the first time at a polo match in 1970, and they soon began a relationship. However, due to various reasons, including Charles' absence due to his royal duties, they both eventually married other partners. Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, a British Army officer, in 1973, and they had two children together. Meanwhile, Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, with whom he had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Despite their marriages to other people, Camilla and Charles maintained a close friendship over the years, which later turned into a romantic affair. This extramarital relationship became the subject of extensive media coverage and speculation. Both their marriages ended in divorce; Camilla and Parker Bowles divorced in 1995, while Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after a highly-publicized separation. After the end of their respective marriages, Charles and Camilla eventually made their relationship public, and after receiving the support of Queen Elizabeth II and the British public, they announced their engagement on February 10, 2005. On April 9, 2005, the couple got married in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall, followed by a religious blessing at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Following their marriage, Camilla assumed the title of \\"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall.\\" As the wife of the Prince of Wales, Camilla has taken on several royal responsibilities and patronages and supports numerous charities, particularly those focused on literacy, animal welfare, and healthcare.

Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University.

Movie title: Dawn of the world Movie plot: The Mesopotamian Marshes, at the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, in the south of Iraq. This is where Mastour and Zahra grow up. Shortly after their marriage, Mastour and Zahra are forced to separate when the Gulf War breaks out. On the battlefield, Mastour befriends Riad, a young soldier from Baghdad. Mortally wounded, Mastour makes Riad promise to protect Zahra when the war is over. When Riad arrives in the village, he falls deeply in love with Zahra. But unable to bear the loss of her husband, Zahra shuts herself off. In this completely foreign environment that is hostile to this newcomer, and as a new conflict is on the verge of inflaming the whole area, Riad will do the impossible to find his place. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Dawn of the World,\\" Mastour and Zahra are forced to separate due to the outbreak of the Gulf War. The Gulf War, which started in 1990, was a conflict between Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, and a coalition of 35 nations led by the United States in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This war had a significant impact on many aspects of life in the region, including the lives of ordinary people like Mastour and Zahra. Being newly married, Mastour and Zahra's separation is a heartbreaking event in their lives. Furthermore, the separation isn't voluntary, as Mastour is likely drafted or pressured into joining the military to fight the war. As a result, Zahra is left behind in the village, waiting for her husband's return and fearing for his safety. Mastour's experiences on the battlefield introduce him to Riad, a young soldier from Baghdad. As the war progresses, the two form a bond of friendship that is tested when Mastour is mortally wounded in combat. Before succumbing to his injuries, Mastour makes Riad promise to protect Zahra once the war is over. Riad fulfills his promise and arrives in the village to look after Zahra, but finds himself falling deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, Zahra struggles to cope with the loss of her husband and isolates herself from her surroundings. The environment in the village becomes hostile towards Riad, with tensions arising from his outsider status and the brewing conflict threatening the stability of the area. In conclusion, the primary force that leads to Mastour and Zahra's separation is the outbreak of the Gulf War, which tore many families apart and drastically altered the lives of those residing in the affected areas. The movie explores themes of love, loss, loyalty, and the struggle to find one's place in a world that is continuously changing due to ongoing conflicts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world. Question: Prior to New York, what city was the center of the world of art?","completion":"Prior to New York City becoming the center of the world of art, Paris, France, held that prestigious title. For centuries, Paris had been the epicenter of the art world, with a rich history of nurturing artistic talent and creativity. This long-standing reputation solidified during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Paris witnessed a flourishing of art movements, schools, and influential artists. Throughout this period, Paris was home to numerous famous artists, such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas. The city provided a fertile environment for the development and exchange of artistic ideas, fostering groundbreaking movements like Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, and Surrealism, which would deeply influence the trajectory of art worldwide. Not only did Paris provide a nurturing cultural atmosphere for artists, but it also offered essential institutional support for the creation and display of art. Institutions like the École des Beaux-Arts, the Académie Julian, and the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs played critical roles in shaping the careers of artists from across the globe. Additionally, annual events, like the Paris Salon and later the Salon des Indépendants, helped showcase and legitimize groundbreaking works by contemporary artists. However, following the end of World War II, the dynamics of the global art scene began to shift. As the article states, the rising prominence and economic prosperity of New York City, along with the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, contributed to its displacement of Paris as the center of the art world. Influential New York artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko, and the rise of American art dealers and galleries played a significant role in reshaping the global artistic landscape. In conclusion, Paris, France, was considered the center of the world of art before New York City took on that role in the mid-20th century. Paris's remarkable history of fostering artistic movements and nurturing world-renowned artists solidified its position as the global art capital until the eventual shift toward New York City due to the United States' rise in economic and cultural influence following World War II."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

Q:Given the background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: Two siblings were going to school.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If more coal is burned, this will result in higher amounts of sulfur in the coal combining with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. The increase in sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere will subsequently lead to increased production of sulfur trioxide when the sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere. As a result, more sulfur trioxide will react with water in the atmosphere to produce larger quantities of sulfuric acid, making rain more acidic. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed, specifically the burning of more coal, would not lead to less sulfuric acid being formed.

Edouard Louis Joseph, baron Merckx (Dutch pronunciation: ['merks]; born 17 June 1945), better known as Eddy Merckx, is a Belgian former professional road and track bicycle racer who is widely seen as the most successful rider in the history of competitive cycling. His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours of France, five Tours of Italy, and a Tour of Spain), all of the five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, every major one-day race other than Paris-Tours, and extensive victories on the track. Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling. Merckx opened the 1967 campaign with two stage victories at the Giro di Sardegna. He followed these successes by entering Paris-Nice where he won the second stage and took the race lead. Two stages later, a teammate, Tom Simpson, attacked with several other riders on a climb and was nearly 20 minutes ahead of Merckx, who remained in a group behind. Merckx attacked two days later on a climb 70 km into the stage. He was able to establish a firm advantage, but obeyed orders from his manager to wait for the chasing Simpson. Merckx won the stage, while Simpson secured his overall victory. On 18 March, Merckx started the Milan-San Remo and was seen as a 120-1 favorite to win the race. He attacked on the Capo Berta and again on the Poggio, leaving only Gianni Motta with him. The two slowed their pace and were joined by two more riders. Merckx won the four-man sprint to the finish. His next victory came in La Fleche Wallonne after he missed out on an early break, caught up to it, and attacked from it to win the race. On 20 May, he started the Giro d'Italia, his first Grand Tour. He won the twelfth and fourteenth stages en route to finishing ninth in the general classification. He signed with Faema on 2 September for ten years worth 400,000 Belgian francs. He chose to switch over in order to be in complete control over the team he was racing for. In addition, he would not have to pay for various expenses that came with racing such as wheels and tires. The next day, Merckx started the men's road race at the 1967 UCI Road World Championships in Heerlen, Netherlands. The course consisted of ten laps of a circuit. Motta attacked on the first lap and was joined by Merckx and five other riders. The group thinned to five as they reached the finish line where Merckx was able to out-sprint Jan Janssen for first place. In doing so, he became the third rider to win the world road race amateur and professional titles. By winning the race he earned the right to wear the rainbow jersey as world champion. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have any other victories?","completion":"Eddy Merckx had an impressive number of victories throughout his career. As mentioned in the original text, his wins include eleven Grand Tours, five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, and almost every major one-day race with the exception of Paris-Tours.

Paragraph: A government-sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County's federally funded legal aid community. The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... After the summit, Trump will probably: A.

Answer this question: who wrote song will you still love me tomorrow??","completion":"\\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,\\" also known as \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\" is a song written by the brilliant songwriting duo of Carole King and Gerry Goffin. It was originally released in 1960 and became a significant hit when it was recorded by the girl group the Shirelles. Carole King and Gerry Goffin were among the most influential and successful songwriting teams in popular music history, crafting numerous hits throughout the 1960s, particularly in the realm of Brill Building pop. The Brill Building, located in New York City, was a hub of American music publishing during that era, and King and Goffin were central figures in the scene. \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" holds a special place in music history as it was the first song by an all-girl group to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its success helped pave the way for future girl groups and created a lasting legacy for the Shirelles.

Every day revolved around alcohol on some form or fashion. It literally was like the movie Animal House Now these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys. Long story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen. Ted married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be. Other than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages.

They are only 4 and 6. Their mother vows to have them apply the info in this book and says it will be just what she needs to get them started when they are ready to learn. Answer:","completion":"Based on the analysis of the product review provided, the tone appears to be leaning more towards a neutral to slightly negative tone. It seems that the reviewer acknowledges the potential value of the product, stating that their grandchildren have piano playing role models and that their mother plans to use the book to help them learn when they are ready. However, the negative aspect comes from the issue mentioned regarding their grandchildren's attention span being too short to actually utilize and learn from the material provided in the book at the moment. The fact that the reviewer points out their grandchildren's age, 4 and 6 years old, implies that they might not be the appropriate audience or target group for this product, and they may not be at the right stage to take full advantage of the material. This observation hints at the possibility of the product not catering well to the younger age group or, at the very least, not addressing the specific needs of children with shorter attention spans. Furthermore, the title communicates a negative message by indicating that the product requires more prolonged attention than what their grandchildren can offer, suggesting that it might not be the most engaging or suited for children of that age group. In summary, while there are some positive aspects mentioned in the review regarding the mother's support and commitment to use the book with her children later on, the overall tone leans towards neutral to slightly negative. This is primarily due to the reviewer's concerns about the product's appropriateness and effectiveness for their young grandchildren, who seem to struggle with focusing on the material for extended periods.

Q: The plot concerns the activities of a group of church musicians, the Mellstock parish choir, one of whom, Dick Dewy, becomes romantically entangled with a comely new school mistress, Fancy Day. The novel opens with the fiddlers and singers of the choir including Dick, his father Reuben Dewy, and grandfather William Dewy making the rounds in Mellstock village on Christmas Eve. When the little band plays at the schoolhouse, young Dick falls for Fancy at first sight. Dick, smitten, seeks to insinuate himself into her life and affections, but Fancy's beauty has gained her other suitors, including a rich farmer and the new vicar at the parish church. The vicar, Mr. Maybold, informs the choir that he intends Fancy, an accomplished organ player, to replace their traditional musical accompaniment to Sunday services. The tranter and the rest of the band visit the vicar's home to negotiate, but reluctantly give way to the more modern organ. Meanwhile, Dick seems to win Fancy's heart, and she discovers an effective strategem to overcome her father's objection to the potential marriage. After the two are engaged secretly, however, vicar Maybold impetuously asks Fancy to marry him and lead a life of relative affluence; racked by guilt and temptation, she accepts. The next day, however, at a chance meeting with the as-yet-unaware Dick, surprised Maybold learns from him of his engagement to Fancy. The vicar follows by prompting her by letter, while expressing being taken aback by such news, to be honest to Dewy and withdraw her commitment to him if she indeed intended to become married to Maybold. Fancy responds by withdrawing her consent to marry Maybold and asking him to keep her initial acceptance of his proposal forever a secret. Maybold replies by urging her again to be honest with Dick and admit she accepted the vicar despite having already committed herself to the young tranter, assuring her she would be forgiven. However, as she marries Dewy who is so in love he readily dismisses what he previously (rightly) considered exhibits of her fickleness and rejoices at what he perceives at the prospect of a happy union based on honesty, given Fancy's effusive and seemingly frank admission to some (minor) infidelities, while he assumes they would never keep any secrets from each other, she resolves never to disclose the truly incontrovertible and damning evidence against her character in her having so readily accepted Maybold despite her engagement to Dewy. The novel ends with a humorous portrait of Reuben, William, Mr. Day, and the rest of the Mellstock rustics as they celebrate the couple's wedding day. The mood is joyful, but at the end of the final chapter, the reader is reminded that Fancy has married with \\"a secret she would never tell\\" (her final flirtation and brief engagement to the vicar). While Under the Greenwood Tree is often seen as Hardy's gentlest and most pastoral novel, this final touch introduces a faint note of melancholy to the conclusion.

What's the best answer to this question: does the u.s. have a 500 bill?","completion":"The best answer to the question, \\"Does the U.S. have a 500 bill?\\" would be: No, the United States does not currently have a 500 bill in circulation. While 500 bills were once issued by the United States Treasury, they were last printed in 1945 and officially discontinued by the Federal Reserve in 1969. As of now, the highest denomination of currency circulated in the U.S. is the 100 bill. However, it is worth noting some historical context surrounding the 500 bill. The 500 bill, featuring a portrait of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. President, was part of a series of large denominations of U.S. currency. These included the 1,000 bill, which featured Grover Cleveland, the 5,000 bill with James Madison, the 10,000 bill depicting Salmon P. Chase, and the extremely rare 100,000 bill showcasing Woodrow Wilson. These large denominations were mostly used for transactions between banks and not meant for public circulation. The primary reason behind the discontinuation of these high-denomination bills was due to advancements in banking technology and the growing preference for checks and electronic payments. Additionally, concerns about money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal activities related to large cash transactions played a role in the decision, as these high-denomination notes made it easier for illegal transactions to occur without detection. While you will not find a 500 bill in regular usage today, they still remain legal tender and can be exchanged at financial institutions. However, since they are now considered collectors' items, they often have a value higher than their face value, depending on their condition and rarity. In conclusion, while the U.S. once had a 500 bill in circulation, it is no longer in use. The current U.S. currency denominations are limited to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 bills, catering to the modern preferences for checks and electronic payment methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. and the situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method. Answer the following question: Which farmer had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates? The answer is:","completion":"Barb, who practiced the no-tillage method, had soil that may delay planting to less ideal dates. This is because, in areas with rigorous winters, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in the spring compared to conventionally tilled soil. As a result, the planting process could be delayed, potentially leading to less favorable growing conditions for crops. While no-tillage has its benefits, such as reduced soil erosion and improved soil quality, this particular drawback highlights the importance of considering the various factors related to different farming practices and understanding how they might impact individual farms in unique ways. Agroecologists typically recognize that one-size-fits-all approaches to farming might not always be suitable and suggest that farmers explore and choose the most appropriate methods based on their specific circumstances and challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal miners happens, how will it affect there is less pollution. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the given process The process is describing the formation and impacts of acid rain due to human industrial activities that generate chemical compounds. These chemicals are released into air, mix with clouds, and fall back to earth as acidic rain, which can damage both natural and man-made objects. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that if there are fewer coal miners, there will be less pollution. Step 3: Analyze the potential impacts of the perturbation hypothesis If there are fewer coal miners, this could result in a decline in coal production and the usage of coal as a source of energy in industries. Coal combustion is known to produce pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of acid rain. Step 4: Evaluate the effect of the perturbation on the process With a decrease in coal production and combustion, there would be a reduction in chemical compounds released from coal-based industries. Consequently, fewer chemical compounds would rise into the air and mix with elements in clouds. This scenario would lead to a decrease in the formation of acid rain. Step 5: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer coal miners and coal production declines, it reduces pollution from coal combustion. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in the formation of acid rain, which ultimately affects the entire process related to the formation and impacts of acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity. Bernard's mother also constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence. The answer is:","completion":"In the given context, Bernard Chanticleer is said to not like girls, or at least not be interested in them yet. This opinion is expressed by his mother, who seems to be quite overprotective and clinging. She is the one who reassures Miss Nora Thing that her son isn't interested in girls and even goes as far as to arrange for Miss Thing to keep an eye on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity. It's important to note that Bernard's lack of interest in girls may not be an accurate representation of his true feelings or preferences, but rather a perception enforced by his overbearing mother. The controlling environment in which he lives - with both his parents constantly monitoring and admonishing him - may have limited his opportunities to form his own opinions and explore relationships. As a result, it may be more accurate to say that Bernard's mother is the one who believes her son is not interested in girls, rather than definitively stating that Bernard himself does not like girls. The context provided suggests that Bernard's mother is trying to maintain control over her son's life, even as he moves out of the family home and attempts to forge his own path. Her insistence on keeping an eye on Bernard through Miss Thing, as well as sending him locks of her hair, highlights her reluctance to let him go and her desire to continue influencing his actions and decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Contrary to common belief, social media websites such as Facebook do not weaken personal ties, they strengthen them in unique ways for different age groups, according to a new study. The rapid spread of Facebook, which has more than 500 million users worldwide, has prompted concerns about its negative effects, but researchers at the University of Texas have reached a different conclusion. \\"Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,\\" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team. \\"In fact, we believe there is sufficient evidence that social media afford opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy and community.\\" The researchers questioned 900 college students and recent graduates about how and with whom they interact on Facebook. More than 60 percent of Facebook users said posting status updates was among the most popular activities, followed by 60 percent who wrote comments on their profile and 49 percent who posted messages and comments to friends. The researchers also found that although about the same number of men and women use Facebook, they do so in different ways. \\"There is a noteworthy difference in aims in how to use a tool like Facebook.We found that for women the content tends to be more affectionate, and (they) are especially interested in using it for connection,\\" said Watkins. \\"For men, it's more functional,\\" he added. Watkins pointed out that, for example, women are more likely to post pictures of social gatherings with friends, while men are more likely to post pictures of hobbies, or post a political or pop-culture related link.

Answer the following question: Context: Sasha heard about the store's contribution to a political candidate she hated and voted with her feet by shopping elsewhere. Question: Why did Sasha do this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: did not want to give the store money B: go home and order online instead from a neutral store C: was happy with the store's politics Answer:","completion":"Sasha decided to shop elsewhere because she heard about the store's contribution to a political candidate she disliked. By doing so, she was voting with her feet, a term used to describe the act of showing one's disapproval or opting out of something by choosing not to participate or engage with it. Now let's examine each of the provided answers in relation to the context and question: A. Sasha did not want to give the store money. This answer best aligns with the context provided, as it reflects the reason why Sasha decided to shop elsewhere. She did not want to passively support a political candidate that she did not agree with by spending her money in a store that donated to the candidate's campaign. By choosing to shop at other establishments, she could indirectly express her dissatisfaction with the store's political affiliations while simultaneously not financially supporting them. B. Sasha wanted to go home and order online from a neutral store instead. While this answer is not entirely incorrect, it is less precise compared to the first one. It suggests that Sasha immediately decided to shop online, which may or may not be the case. The primary focus should be on her dissatisfaction with the store's political contributions and her choice not to support them financially, rather than the specifics of where she decided to shop instead. C. Sasha was happy with the store's politics. This answer is clearly incorrect within the context provided. The information given indicates that Sasha was unhappy with the store's support of a political candidate she didn't like, which prompted her to vote with her feet by shopping at a different location. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the answer that best addresses the question \\"Why did Sasha do this?\\" is answer A. Sasha did not want to give the store money because she disagreed with their political contributions. Choosing to shop elsewhere allowed her to voice her discontent and abstain from contributing her own resources to the store's political affiliations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: Can a person with extremely low tolerance to weed get high of off tiny traces of THC? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are similar, but they are asking about different aspects of exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke and low-tolerance individuals. Let's break down the two questions separately and analyze the differences. Question 1: \\"Is it hard to get a second hand high from weed even if you have a low tolerance?\\" This question focuses on whether it is difficult for someone with a low tolerance to marijuana to experience a second-hand high (also known as a contact high) from being in the presence of marijuana smoke. In other words, it asks if someone with a low tolerance can get high, even without directly consuming the drug, simply by being exposed to the smoke in the air. Question 2: \\"Can a person with extremely low tolerance to weed get high off of tiny traces of THC?\\" While this question also relates to individuals with low tolerance to marijuana, it specifically targets the idea of whether these people can get high from minuscule amounts of THC, which is the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. This question leans more towards the potency of THC in small quantities and how it would affect a person with low tolerance. Answering the questions: It's important to know that several factors can influence the potential for a second-hand high. These factors include the concentration of THC in the marijuana, the size and ventilation of the room, and the duration of exposure to the smoke. For example, if a room is small, unventilated, and filled with smoke for a prolonged period, there is a higher chance for second-hand high. Although it is generally considered challenging to get a second-hand high (Question 1) as the concentration of THC in second-hand smoke is relatively low, someone with an extremely low tolerance to marijuana might experience some mild psychoactive effects. However, these effects are likely to be far less potent than if they directly consumed THC. In a well-ventilated environment, it's unlikely that the person with low tolerance would experience any noticeable effects. Regarding Question 2, it is still unlikely for an individual with low tolerance to get high solely from tiny traces of THC, as the concentration will likely not be sufficient to induce psychoactive effects. Human bodies have different sensitivity levels to THC; however, the traces from second-hand smoke are generally not enough to produce significant effects for most individuals, even those with a low tolerance. In conclusion, while both questions touch on the possible effects of marijuana smoke on people with low tolerance, they target different aspects of this issue. Question 1 asks about second-hand high occurrence based on the given condition, while Question 2 addresses the question of whether tiny traces of THC can impact low-tolerance individuals. Overall, it's unlikely for someone with low tolerance to get high from either second-hand smoke or minimal THC traces, although the chance of experiencing mild effects may be higher with prolonged exposure under specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end in May 1683 when Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of Vienna in the Great Turkish War of 1683–1687. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king Jan III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna. The alliance of the Holy League pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna, culminating in the Treaty of Karlowitz (26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War. The Ottomans surrendered control of significant territories, many permanently. Mustafa II (1695–1703) led the counterattack of 1695–96 against the Habsburgs in Hungary, but was undone at the disastrous defeat at Zenta (in modern Serbia), 11 September 1697.

With no official figures available, it is estimated that 600,000-900,000 persons fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War .

Another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons.

Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive Syrian occupation.

Johnny now hosts an entity called 'The Rider', a fiery demon who punishes sinners, no matter how petty the crimes are. However, his father dies regardless, and having two minds fighting for control over his new powers, Johnny attempts to stay as far away from mankind as possible, hiding out in Eastern Europe (Romania).In the present, a drunken priest named Moreau (Idris Elba) attempts to warn the order of monks residing in a castle that the Devil has sent out forces to retrieve a certain boy and his mother hiding there, despite the head monk's (Anthony Head) reassurances of their safety. At that moment, mercenaries hired by Roarke breach the castle and kill all of the monks except for Moreau, while the mother, Nadya (Violante Placido) and her son Danny escape. Moreau chases after them, as well as the mercenaries.

Given the question: For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners?

Sister Mary Bonaventure is in charge of the hospital ward of a convent in the county of Norfolk, England. She is troubled by her own sister's suicide, which she confides to her Mother Superior. A torrential rain closes nearby roads, causing Sergeant Melling of the police to bring condemned murderer Valerie Carns there. She is being taken to prison. Valerie was convicted of poisoning her brother Jason, a pianist. Jason's physician, Dr. Jeffreys, is head of the hospital where Sister Mary now works. Valerie still proclaims her innocence, but Jeffreys insists that she gave Jason a fatal overdose of his medicine. A photograph of Jason clearly disturbs Isabel Jeffreys, the doctor's wife. He gives her a sedative. Valerie appeals to Sister Mary to bring her fiance, Sidney Kingham, to the convent to see her.

To find the value of o, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In order to do that, first, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. -216 * o + 2808 = 0 -216 * o = -2808 (Subtract 2808 from both sides of the equation) Step 3: Solve for o. Now, we need to get the variable o by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -216.

Help as much as you can. This article: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, shin-daiko... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the creator of the style that is thought to be the first to descend from the one reported in a journal in 1849?, what is it ?

Apple is opening up about how many government requests it gets for customer information. The secretive company released its first transparency report on Tuesday, breaking down the number of account and device data requests it received from law enforcement by country for the first half of 2013. The United States submitted the most requests for account information, with 1,000 to 2,000 requests regarding 2,000 to 3,000 individual accounts. These requests might be for personal information found in iTunes, Game Center and iCloud accounts. The vast majority of requests the company receives are from law enforcement agencies trying to track down lost or stolen phones, tablets and computers on behalf of Apple customers. Apple received 3,542 of these \\"device information\\" requests in the U.S. for 8,605 devices, and Apple turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time. Germany made the second largest number of device requests, followed by Singapore. This is the first time Apple has released a transparency report. Google began disclosing data about its government requests in 2011 and releases an updated list every six months. Since the initial revelations about surveillance by the National Security Agency came to light earlier this year, there has been an uptick in the number of tech companies voluntarily releasing statistics on the government requests they get. Apple joins Facebook, Yahoo and other tech companies taking part in a practice that is fast becoming industry standard. \\"Apple is so secretive about everything it does, the fact that it is opening up shows that transparency really is the new standard, and the consumers are demanding it,\\" said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Though the information in the reports is somewhat standard, Apple did included something different. The last line under the notes section in the report says, \\"Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us.\\" Section 215 is the part of the Patriot Act the NSA could use to compel companies to hand over user data. If Apple did receive such an order, it would likely be accompanied by a gag order so Apple would not even be able to say that it did or did not receive a 215 request. Cardozo says this type of disclosure is called a canary, and Apple is the first major tech company to include it. \\"Six months from now, we will look to make sure that line is included, and if they don't say they have not received a 215 request, we can assume they have,\\" said Cardozo. Apple also joined Yahoo and Google and filed a brief in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court asking for more transparency to discuss government requests openly and in more detail. Currently, the U.S. government only allows companies to talk about how many national security orders, including the numbers of accounts impacted, in ranges of thousands. \\"We have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share, and Apple will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive,\\" Apple said in the report. The other information in Apple's report was fairly standard. It's difficult to compare Apple's numbers directly to those previously disclosed by companies such as Facebook and Google. Though they're all technology companies, they are vastly different businesses and store different amounts and types of data about their users. \\"Our business does not depend on collecting personal data. We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers,\\" Apple said in the beginning of the report. That statement seems to be dig directed at companies such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and many others that do base their businesses on collecting their customers' personal information. The hunger for personal data isn't limited to governments as it's also very lucrative for many technology companies. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The motley crew of godless Grinches have shown no mercy to either the sacred or the secular. But when it comes to protesting the holy days of other religions, the atheists and agnostics and Satanists are curiously quiet. I don’t seem to recall the Satanists posting a Satanic pentagram outside a mosque. Some call it a war on Christmas -- but it goes much deeper than just hating a holiday. It's a war on the very foundation of our nation -- the essence of who we are as a people. We are one nation under God. A God who sent his son to be born in the city of David -- a savior -- who is Christ the Lord.

Article:John Arthur Jones, 66, of Bodffordd, Anglesey, caused dangerous distractions to pilots on night training flights in Hawk jets, Mold Crown Court heard. He denies 13 charges of endangering aircraft between November 2013 and September 2014. The court heard Mr Jones had a grievance against the RAF and had, at one stage, considered legal action. Prosecutor John Philpotts when Mr Jones was interviewed, he alleged pilots were deliberately harassing him by flying over his property from RAF Valley. He said he only went outside to inspect his property with a torch and may have, on one occasion, instinctively shone it upwards as a jet passed by, but it was not deliberate. Mr Philpotts said an under cover police officer watched a man shine a torch at aircraft on one occasion and that was Mr Jones. Mr Jones lives close to a relief landing strip at RAF Mona, which has been used for more than 100 years. \\"It is the prosecution case that he became obsessed with the activity of the aircraft flying out,\\" Mr Philpotts said. \\"He became displeased by the aviation activity in the skies near his land.\\" On occasions, jets had to abandon landings, the jury was told.

The formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m (656 ft) more than today, which flooded coastal areas. Furthermore, Pangaea began to rift into smaller divisions, bringing more land area in contact with the ocean by forming the Tethys Sea. Temperatures continued to increase and began to stabilize. Humidity also increased with the proximity of water, and deserts retreated. Q: As humidity increased what land area decreased?","completion":"As humidity increased during the Mesozoic Era, the size of the deserts decreased. This happened because more water was available in the atmosphere, making the environment less dry and more suitable for plants and animals to live in. With increased humidity and warmer temperatures, the Earth became more hospitable, allowing for greater diversity in plant and animal life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and... The writer of this article most likely believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Pres. Moon really wants to bring South and North Korea back together B. not enough information C. Pres. Moon wants peace D. President Moon is trying very hard to bring the US, North Korea, and China together Answer:","completion":"D.

Furthermore, the article also highlights President Moon's efforts in emphasizing denuclearization as a crucial condition for peace while maintaining compliance with economic sanctions in place. From these points, it can be inferred that the writer most likely believes that President Moon is trying very hard to bring the US, North Korea, and China together (option D) to achieve peace and address the issue of North Korea's nuclear program, thus making it the most accurate answer among the given options."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Erin had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal. b). Natalie had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal.","completion":"Erin had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal. From a young age, she had been captivated by stories of spirits, haunted places, and the unexplained phenomena that seemed to defy what everyone knew to be true about the world. Naturally, she tended toward superstition in her everyday life, often attributing bizarre occurrences to the ghosts that she believed walked among the living. Natalie, on the other hand, was the polar opposite. A devout skeptic, she was unwavering in her conviction that every strange occurrence could be explained with enough logical scrutiny. While Erin attended paranormal conventions and read up on otherworldly beings, Natalie immersed herself in all things science-related. In her view, the natural world was infinitely more fascinating than the fictitious plane of existence imagined by those who indulged in supernatural fantasies. Yet, despite their remarkably different viewpoints, the two friends shared a remarkably strong bond. In part, their friendship had endured simply because they were constantly challenging each other's beliefs. On more than one occasion, they had found themselves in the midst of a heated debate about the validity of a ghostly testimonial, the preposterous nature of the paranormal investigator's methods, or the statistical probability of spirits existing. Ironically, it seemed as though their disagreements only solidified their trust in each other. Now, the old Victorian house before them stood as a testament to their enduring friendship and ever-present rivalry. Their interest in the house had been piqued when they came across an article in the local newspaper noting its sordid past and ghostly legends. It was the haunted house that would ultimately determine the ultimate victor between the two. Erin was sure that this would finally give her the opportunity to prove to Natalie that ghosts were real. The house itself was like something out of a horror novel, its ancient wood groaning and creaking under the weight of some unseen force. The grounds were shrouded in an aura of mystery, drawing her into its haunting depths. Natalie, however, refused to be swayed by Erin's presumptions. To her, the house was simply an old building with an overgrown garden and an interesting history. The fact that people told ghost stories about it was nothing more than a byproduct of human imagination and fear of the unknown. She was determined to use this opportunity to show Erin that there were rational explanations for every positively chilling detail she would no doubt stumble upon during their investigation. Together, the friends entered the house armed with notepads, flashlights, and recording devices. For two nights, they sought paranormal activity in every nook and cranny of the dilapidated home, their eyes peeled for any sign of apparitions or other supernatural phenomena. Erin would gasp and point out cold spots, orbs, and unexplained sounds, while Natalie documented each instance and offered her own natural explanation. Yet, neither the skeptic nor the believer was ready to admit defeat. On the third night, they ventured into the dusty attic. The air was heavy with anticipation as they sifted through the piles of forgotten heirlooms. Just as Erin began to lose hope of ever finding definitive proof of the ghostly inhabitants she believed haunted the house, Natalie stumbled upon a mysterious, leather-bound journal. Although she had discovered it by chance, the journal's contents were far from ordinary. In her quest to disprove the paranormal, Natalie had unwittingly stumbled upon the memoir of an occultist who had once lived in the house. As they delved into the troubling confessions of the journal's owner, delusions of grandeur and sinister experiments came to light. Erin and Natalie's friendship evolved as they recognized that the eerie occurrences within the house stemmed from the tenuous line between the paranormal and human psychology. Ultimately, their journey bound them together with a newfound respect for the inexplicable mysteries of the world, as well as the spaces that lay between the realm of the living and the beyond."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what track and field event for me?

Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. But I can use this background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2. 1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last. Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\". It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.","completion":"This text is about Talking Heads, an American rock band that was formed in 1975 in New York City and was active until 1991.

UPDATED:. 08:07 EST, 21 October 2013. A school has shamed a parent by publishing a photograph in its newsletter of her car parked on double-yellow lines outside the gates. Fed-up teachers at Cottesmore St Mary’s Catholic Primary School, in Hove, East Sussex, say the driver of the Honda CRV constantly parks on zigzags and double yellows. When challenged about her behaviour, the woman driver was allegedly 'unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude', the newsletter says. Caught: Cottesmore St Mary¿s Catholic Primary School published this photograph of the car in its newsletter. The school decided to publish an image of the vehicle illegally parked alongside a polite request for drivers to be more considerate. The letter reads: 'It was reported, by a parent, that this car parks on the zigzags or the double yellow lines every day. 'Apparently, on Wednesday the lady car owner was asked to move off the zigzags pre-end of day pick up. 'She then apparently had moved onto the double yellow lines, making it difficult to turn the corner and thus making it dangerous for the children to cross the road. 'Apparently the lady driver was asked to move again by a parent but was unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude. 'If this car belongs to you or someone you know, please do pass on our concerns about illegal parking and the impact it can have on the safety of our children.' A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said he could not comment specifically on the incident at the school. But he added: 'Zigzags are usually in place where it is dangerous for people to park, for example outside a school entrance or on the lead up to a crossing. 'Zigzags are enforceable 24 hours a day seven days a week unless there is a sign that states otherwise. 'We are now issuing tickets by post for these offences. 'This means that if you are seen, by a CCTV operator or a Civil Enforcement Officer, to be parked on a zigzag a penalty charge notice will be sent to the registered keeper of the vehicle.' Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic Primary School has begun shaming parents who park on double yellow lines outside the school in its newsletter. A Sussex Police spokesman added: 'Parking in restricted areas for the sake of a few minutes’ walk is just laziness and is plainly hazardous to children arriving at or leaving school. 'Officers from the neighbourhood policing teams and road policing regularly check schools around starting and finishing times and vehicles parked illegally will be ticketed. 'Any schools experiencing parking problems should speak to their school liaison officer or local neighbourhood team.'","completion":"Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic Primary School in Hove, East Sussex, has taken the step of publishing a photograph of a car parked on double-yellow lines outside the school in its newsletter.

Write an article using the following points: Solange Knowles, Jay Z and his wife, Beyonce, release a statement. TMZ released video showing an altercation between Solange and Jay Z in an elevator. They say they have \\"worked through it,\\" saying all families have their problems. The statement refutes that Solange was intoxicated. Article:","completion":"Title: Knowles-Carter Family Addresses Elevator Incident: A United Front Amidst Controversy Three of music's biggest stars - Solange Knowles, Jay Z, and his wife, Beyoncé - have come together to release a joint statement addressing the recent controversy surrounding a leaked video of an altercation between Jay Z and Solange. The now-infamous clip, released by TMZ, took the media by storm, as fans and critics alike tried to piece together the events that transpired within an elevator following an after-party for the 2014 Met Gala in New York City. In the brief, but revealing video, Solange can be seen lunging towards Jay Z, with what appears to be an exchange of words and physical aggression between the two. Beyoncé appears in the video as well, seemingly remaining calm and collected amidst the chaos. Despite rampant speculation as to what could have prompted the altercation and the state of the Knowles-Carter family dynamics, the trio has remained tight-lipped until now. Through their joint statement, Solange, Jay Z, and Beyoncé acknowledge the events captured on video, stating that they have \\"worked through it,\\" emphasizing that all families face their fair share of problems, and theirs is no exception. As public figures, they also took the opportunity to lay to rest some of the most widespread rumors, particularly the claim that Solange was intoxicated during the incident. \\"Solange, Jay, and Beyoncé have always been a close-knit family,\\" reads the statement. \\"We love each other, and above all else, we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.\\" The family's united front in addressing the matter solidifies their commitment to moving beyond the controversy, both personally and professionally. In the wake of the leaked footage, fans and observers alike could not help but dissect the incident and formulate theories as to its cause. The speculation spiraled out of control as conflicting reports and sources offered alleged explanations, ranging from personal disputes to infidelity-related accusations, often vilifying Solange Knowles. However, the unified response from Solange, Jay Z, and Beyoncé now serves to refute such characterizations, reminding the public that the inner workings of even high-profile families should remain private matters. Their concise yet clear statement sends a strong message: they want to move forward from the upheaval triggered by the leaked video and focus on their relationship as a family. In an ever-invasive media landscape, it is not uncommon for celebrities to find their private lives exposed and scrutinized. The Knowles-Carter family's response to the elevator incident demonstrates an admirable display of solidarity and restraint in the face of adversity. By directly addressing the matter and refuting some of the most widely circulated falsehoods, they have taken control of the narrative, reinforcing the image of a strong, resilient family unit that will stand together come what may. Rather than further fueling the controversy with a lengthy public discussion, Solange, Jay Z, and Beyoncé have chosen to keep their reconciliation behind closed doors. By releasing the statement, they have temporarily satisfied public curiosity, but more importantly, they have taken steps to protect themselves and their family from further harm caused by the constant tabloid speculation. With their unwavering support for each other, the Knowles-Carter family has proven that they are more than just a famous trio—they are a united front, resilient in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Native Hawaiians (Hawaiian: kanaka \`oiwi, kanaka maoli, and Hawai\`i maoli) are the aboriginal Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands or their descendants. Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report for 2000, there are 401,000 people who identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 141,000 people identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone. Another important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\`i State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\`i political stars Benjamin J. Cayetano, John D. Waihee III, and Jeremy Harris enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park). Besides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\`i, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the Territory of Hawai\`i in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\`i as public lands in 1959. OHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\`i through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. Rice v. Cayetano--suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections--reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\`i, regardless of ethnicity.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did anything important happen?","completion":"Yes, something important happened.

One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In case A, would the group get less or more benefit as a whole than in case B? A:","completion":"In case A, the group would likely receive more benefits as a whole than in case B. This is because living in a larger herd offers several advantages for the African Buffalo, which in turn benefits the entire group. Some of these advantages include: 1. Improved predator defense: A larger herd typically means enhanced safety from predators such as lions and hyenas. In a big group, there are more eyes and ears to detect threats, and the sheer number of individuals can intimidate or deter predators. If a predator does attack the group, there is strength in numbers, and the buffaloes are more likely to fend off the predator together. 2. Enhanced foraging opportunities: Although competition for resources like food and water might be higher in a larger herd, there are also benefits. A bigger group can cover more ground while grazing, which means that a larger herd will potentially have access to more diverse food sources than a smaller herd. This can improve the overall health and well-being of the entire group. 3. Social structure and support: A large herd offers a well-defined social structure, which can provide stability and support for the buffaloes. This can lead to improved reproductive success for the males as they can establish dominance in a bigger group, and females are more likely to find a suitable mate. Additionally, large herds can provide better protection for calves, increasing their chances of survival. 4. Effective communication and learning: Living in a large herd enables the buffaloes to learn from each other, particularly when it comes to finding new food sources or waterholes. They can also communicate more effectively about potential threats or other important information. 5. Genetic diversity: A larger herd typically offers greater genetic diversity, improving the overall genetic health of the group. This can lead to stronger immune systems and better adaptability, which ultimately contributes to the long-term survival of the entire group. In summary, although there may be some drawbacks, such as increased competition for resources, the benefits of living in a larger herd (case A) generally outweigh those of a smaller herd (case B) for African Buffaloes. This results in the group receiving more benefits as a whole in case A compared to case B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, the number of animals will likely decrease under Jessica's plan. This is because: 1. Jessica suggests emitting more anthropogenic gases, which contribute to global warming. 2. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect, which is driven by the release of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. 3. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report indicates that the Earth is warming rapidly, and this warming leads to the extinction of natural habitats. 4. A reduction in natural habitats ultimately results in a decline in wildlife population, which means fewer animals.

I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul.

Recently, the detectives learned that a man named Joseph Zieler, who was already in jail for doing other bad things, might be the one responsible for hurting Robin and Lisa. They used a special type of science called DNA to see if he was the one who did it. The DNA matched, which means Joseph Zieler was the bad person who hurt the little girl and her babysitter. Robin's mommy was not home that night, and she found both Robin and Lisa when she returned the next morning. The bad man had done terrible things like hurting them and not allowing them to breathe, which made them go to heaven. The detectives didn't know if there was any connection between Joseph Zieler and the girl and her babysitter before this happened.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.

B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","completion":"C. no. The hypothesis \\"I was desperate to buy a house\\" is contradictory to the premise \\"and the buying a house was the last thing that I wanted to do.\\" The premise indicates a reluctance, lack of interest, or opposition towards buying a house. It shows that the person wasn't eager or willing to buy a house and instead, it was something they preferred to avoid or delay as much as possible. This sentiment could be driven by a variety of reasons, such as financial constraints, not finding a house they liked, being comfortable with their current living situation, or simply not being ready to take on the responsibilities that come with owning a home. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a sense of urgency, eagerness, or a strong desire to buy a house. It suggests that the person was driven, whether by necessity or desire, to actively seek and purchase a house. This kind of behavior could be attributed to factors such as a growing family needing more space, a desire for investment, finding a dream house, or wanting to establish roots in a certain neighborhood or city.

Mr. Comey started receiving daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation, beginning at least three weeks ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter and the progress of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and FBI Director James Comey's firing (all times local): 12:25 p.m. Three U.S. officials say fired FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers that he asked the Justice Department for more money for the bureau's investigation into Russia's election meddling. President Donald Trump fired Comey Tuesday. The officials say Comey told lawmakers he had made the request to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department is denying that Comey asked for more resources. The White House has wielded a critical memo from Rosenstein to justify President Donald Trump's decision to fire Comey on Tuesday. Rosenstein's memo focused only on Comey's handling of last year's investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's email practices. It does not mention the Russia investigation. The officials were not authorized to disclose the meetings publicly and insisted on anonymity. -By Julie Pace and Eileen Sullivan __ 12:10 p.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (SEHR'-gay LAHV'-rahf) says it is \\"humiliating\\" for the American people to hear that Russia is controlling the political situation in the U.S. Lavrov is speaking at the Russian Embassy in Washington after meetings with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He said Wednesday that politicians raising questions about Russian interference in the election are damaging the U.S. political system by suggesting that it is being controlled externally. Lavrov is brushing off the questions as \\"noise\\" about Russians' contacts with people in Trump's campaign. He says through a translator that \\"there is not a single fact\\" or piece of compelling evidence proving Russia's intervention in the election. Lavrov is pointing out that Trump dismisses the controversy as \\"false news.\\" ___ 11:45 a.m. President Donald Trump says ousted FBI Director James Comey \\"was not doing a good job.\\" It was Trump's first public remarks about his firing Tuesday of the FBI chief. Trump briefly spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday after a closed meeting with Russia's foreign minister. His remarks come as the White House is defending the decision to dismiss Comey. Administration officials have said the firing was not related to the investigation into possible contacts between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Trump was joined by Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state and national security adviser under President Richard Nixon. __ 11:20 a.m. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says there's no need for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's ties to the Trump campaign in the wake of the firing of the FBI director. GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina says his committee has the jurisdiction and responsibility to continue its Russia investigation and \\"we are going to do that.\\" However Burr reiterated questions about President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. \\"The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn't make sense to me.\\" And, Burr said that the firing \\"made our task a little more difficult but it didn't make it impossible so we'll continue.\\" Burr said he spoke to Trump but wouldn't detail the exchange. He said they didn't discuss his committee's investigation __ 11:12 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence is defending the firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying the \\"president made the right decision at the right time.\\" He said Comey's firing was not related to the investigation into possible contacts between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Pence says the administration is now looking forward to finding someone to lead the law enforcement agency. President Donald Trump fired Comey on Tuesday. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, criticized Comey's handling of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices. Pence says Comey had lost the confidence of the American people. He says Trump took \\"strong and decisive leadership\\" to put the safety and security of the American people first. __ 11:05 a.m. The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says President Donald Trump told her that he was firing FBI Director James Comey because \\"the department is a mess.\\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said she was surprised and taken aback after Trump called her and other senators to deliver the news shortly before the White House announced Comey's dismissal Tuesday. Feinstein says she questions the reasoning and timing behind Trump's decision and asked the GOP-led committee to bring in Justice Department officials to explain it. She said what \\"sticks in her mind\\" is a classified briefing Comey delivered in March in which he laid out counterintelligence and criminal investigations the FBI is conducting into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. She said it's clear \\"the FBI was taking its job seriously.\\" __ 10:45 a.m. The Senate's Russia investigators are asking the Treasury Department's criminal investigation division for any information relevant to President Donald Trump, his top aides and campaign officials. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN that the request is part of the panel's effort to \\"follow the intel no matter where it leads.\\" Warner's office confirmed the senator's comments. The Senate intelligence committee is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties between Trump associates and the Russian government. The House intelligence committee is conducting a parallel investigation. ___ 10:25 a.m. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Russia is not concerned about Comey's firing. When asked how Comey's sacking could influence Russia-U.S. ties, Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday: \\"This is the U.S. president's sovereign decision which does not have anything to do with Russia and should not have anything to do with Russia.\\" Russian state television network Rossiya 24 referred to President Richard Nixon's firing of independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. It said that \\"the story with Comey is different.\\" Comey, it said, \\"played a good cop and fell into a trap he had set for himself.\\" Senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov tweeted that Comey \\"kept an eye on the 'Russian threat' so hard that he did not notice the threat of his own sacking.\\" Another senior lawmaker, Konstantin Kosachev, rejected suggestions that Comey's sacking could have a Russian link. \\"The 'Russian trail' is hardly there and definitely could not have been the underlying cause for the firing of such a prominent player on the Washington scene,\\" Kosachev told the Interfax news agency. \\"Because this trail is merely a tool in the domestic political game and Trump's stakes are more than just about the Russia issue.\\" __ 10:20 a.m. A Justice Department official says Attorney General Jeff Sessions is interviewing candidates to serve as the interim replacement for fired FBI Director James Comey. Comey's deputy, FBI veteran Andrew McCabe, has become acting director after Comey was fired by President Donald Trump. But a Justice Department official says senior leaders are interviewing additional candidates who could do the job until a permanent replacement for Comey is named and confirmed by the Senate. An announcement about Comey's interim successor could come as soon as Wednesday. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the selection process by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. ___ 10 a.m. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is asking that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy appear before the Senate to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. The New York Democrat said Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should discuss why Sessions participated in the decision to fire Comey despite recusing himself and whether Rosenstein acted on his own when recommending Comey's dismissal or whether he was order to do so by the White House. Schumer also repeated his call for a special counsel to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and the Russian government. He also said the administration should answer why the president didn't wait until the Justice Department's inspector general issued a report on Comey's much-criticized actions regarding the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. ___ 9:50 a.m. Amid Democratic calls for a special prosecutor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says a new investigation of Russia meddling could only serve to impede the current probes underway. McConnell spoke on the Senate floor as Democratic senators gathered to try to pressure the GOP over President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. McConnell didn't give his own view on Trump's decision to fire Comey. But he noted that Democrats had repeatedly criticized Comey in the past, and had called for his removal. Following McConnell on the floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a special prosecutor. But McConnell said: \\"Today we'll no doubt hear calls for a new investigation which could only serve to impede the current work being done.\\" The Senate and House intelligence committees are investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and Russian ties to the Trump campaign. ___ 9:40 a.m. Sen. Lindsey Graham says he doesn't believe a special prosecutor should be considered unless the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's possible connections to Russia becomes a criminal matter. It's now a counterintelligence investigation. The South Carolina Republican says if it becomes \\"a criminal investigation where the Trump campaign may be exposed to criminal charges, then that's the time to have that conversation.\\" Graham says he's confident the FBI's investigation won't be hampered by President Donald Trump's firing of the bureau's director, James Comey. ___ 9:30 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman says Moscow isn't concerned about the firing of the FBI director. Dmitry Peskov says Russia hopes that President Donald Trump's decision to fire the FBI's James Comey won't affect U.S.-Russia ties \\"in any way.\\" Peskov calls it \\"an entirely domestic matter\\" for the United States. ___ 9:10 a.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is reacting sarcastically to questions about President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were asked during a photo-op whether Comey's firing cast a shadow over the meeting between the two diplomats. Lavrov said: \\"Was he fired? You're kidding. You're kidding.\\" Then the Russian diplomat waved his hand dismissively and exited the room alongside Tillerson. The meeting comes amid growing concerns about Trump's decision to fire the head of the law enforcement agency investigating Russian interference in the U.S. election and possible collusion by Trump's campaign. Lavrov is scheduled to meet later Wednesday with Trump at the White House. __ 8:50 a.m. President Donald Trump is attacking Sen. Richard Blumenthal for criticizing his firing of FBI Director James Comey. The Connecticut Democrat appeared on MSNBC and CNN Wednesday morning. On CNN, Blumenthal said that the firing had prompted a \\"looming constitutional crisis.\\" Trump tweeted Wednesday that he was watching Blumenthal speak, calling it a \\"joke.\\" He criticized Blumenthal for past statements that he served in Vietnam, saying he \\"would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there.\\" Trump said that Blumenthal \\"cried like a baby\\" when caught and that he should be investigated. Trump has previously attacked Blumenthal over statements that he served in Vietnam. Blumenthal was in the Marine Corps Reserves at the time but did not fight in Vietnam. __ 7:40 a.m. President Donald Trump says that Republicans and Democrats will soon \\"be thanking me\\" for firing FBI Director James Comey. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning that Comey had \\"lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.\\" He added: \\"when things calm down, they will be thanking me!\\" Trump abruptly fired Comey Tuesday night. The surprise decision came amid the law enforcement agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. __ 7:24 a.m. President Donald Trump says fired FBI Director James Comey \\"will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.\\" In an early-morning tweet Wednesday, Trump attacked Democrats critical of his firing of Comey. Trump said that Democrats \\"have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\\" Trump abruptly fired Comey in the midst of the law enforcement agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. ___ 4:40 a.m. Amid the clamor surrounding the firing of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump singled out one another Washington fixture for his scorn. The president went to his Twitter account late Tuesday to chide Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, for comments the Democrat made about the stunning dismissal. Trump had telephoned Schumer earlier to inform him of the decision. Schumer said he told Trump that \\"you are making a big mistake.\\" Schumer also questioned why the firing occurred on Tuesday and wondered whether investigations into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia were \\"getting too close for the president.\\" He said unless a special prosecutor is named, Americans could rightfully wonder whether the move was \\"part of a cover-up.\\" Trump fired back with a tweet exclaiming: \\"Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant.\\" ___ 3:35 a.m. President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey throws into question the future of a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's possible connections to Russia. It immediately raised suspicions of an underhanded effort to stymie a probe that has shadowed the administration from the outset. Democrats likened the firing to President Richard Nixon's \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\" and renewed calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor, and some Republicans also questioned the move. In his letter to Comey, Trump said the firing was necessary to restore \\"public trust and confidence\\" in the FBI. The administration paired the letter with a scathing review by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of how Comey handled the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's email practices, including his decision to hold a news conference announcing its findings and releasing \\"derogatory information\\" about Clinton. __ 11:05 p.m. FBI Director James Comey was speaking to agents at the FBI's field office in Los Angeles when the news of his firing broke. That's according to a law enforcement official who was present at the time Tuesday. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to discuss the situation publicly. The official says television screens in the field office began flashing the news, and Comey initially chuckled. But he continued to speak to the agents, finishing his speech before heading into an office. He did not reappear in the main room. Comey later left Los Angeles on a plane to return to Washington. —By Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles ||||| With a lot of the speculation that the firing of James Comey was about more than his handling of the Clinton e-mail scandal, here is more news that won’t look good: Breaking News: Days before his firing, Comey asked the Justice Dept. for more money for the FBI inquiry into Russia https://t.co/K33pJO300n — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 10, 2017 Days before he was fired, James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, asked the Justice Department for a significant increase in money and personnel for the bureau’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the presidential election, according to three officials with knowledge of his request. Mr. Comey asked for the resources during a meeting last week with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who wrote the Justice Department’s memo that was used to justify the firing of the F.B.I. director this week. Again, that Comey was fired because of the Russia probe instead of the Clinton scandal is just speculation. However, with a media that is not friendly to the Trump Administration, and with the number of leaks this administration has produced, the best case scenario is that Trump’s timing was bad. UPDATED: The Department of Justice has denied the claim. ||||| President Donald Trump weighed firing his FBI director for more than a week. When he finally pulled the trigger Tuesday afternoon, he didn’t call James Comey. He sent his longtime private security guard to deliver the termination letter in a manila folder to FBI headquarters. He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said. Story Continued Below Trump’s firing of the high-profile FBI director on the 110th day after the president took office marked another sudden turn for an administration that has fired its acting attorney general, national security adviser and now its FBI director, whom Trump had praised until recent weeks and even blew a kiss to during a January appearance. The news stunned Comey, who saw news of his dismissal on TV while speaking inside the FBI office in Los Angeles. It startled all but the uppermost ring of White House advisers, who said grumbling about Comey hadn’t dominated their own morning senior staff meetings. Other top officials learned just before it happened and were unaware Trump was considering firing Comey. “Nobody really knew,” one senior White House official said. “Our phones all buzzed and people said, ‘What?’” By ousting the FBI director investigating his campaign and associates, Trump may have added more fuel to the fire he is furiously trying to contain — and he was quickly criticized by a chorus of Republicans and Democrats. “The timing of this firing was very troubling,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Trump had grown angry with the Russia investigation — particularly Comey admitting in front of the Senate that the FBI was investigating his campaign — and that the FBI director wouldn’t support his claims that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones in Trump Tower. Bipartisan criticism of Comey had mounted since last summer after the director delivered a lengthy statement outlining why no charges would be brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. But the fallout seemed to take the White House by surprise. Trump made a round of calls around 5 p.m., asking for support from senators. White House officials believed it would be a “win-win” because Republicans and Democrats alike had had problems with the FBI director, one person briefed on the administration’s deliberations said. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told him he was making a big mistake — and Trump seemed “taken aback,” according to a person familiar with the call. By Tuesday evening, the president was watching the coverage of his decision and frustrated no one was on TV defending him, a White House official said. He wanted surrogates out there beating the drum. Instead, advisers were attacking one another for not realizing the gravity of the situation as events blew up. “How are you not defending your position for three solid hours on TV?” the White House aide asked. Two White House officials said there was little communications strategy in handling the firing, and that staffers were given talking points late Tuesday for hastily arranged media appearances. Aides soon circulated previous quotes from Schumer hitting Comey. After Schumer called for a special prosecutor, the White House huddled in press secretary Sean Spicer’s office to devise a strategy and sent “fresh faces” to TV, one White House official said. By Tuesday night, aides were using TV appearances to spin the firing as a simple bureaucratic matter and call for an end to the investigation. “It’s time to move on,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said on Fox News. In his letter dismissing Comey, Trump said the FBI director had given him three private assurances that he wasn’t under investigation. The White House declined to say when those conversations happened — or why Comey would volunteer such information. It is not the first time Trump has publicly commented on an ongoing investigation — typically a no-no for presidents. He said earlier this month that Comey had done Clinton a favor by letting her off easy. Trump received letters from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, calling for Comey’s dismissal, on Tuesday, a spokesman said. The president then decided to fire the FBI director based on the recommendations and moved quickly. The spokesman said Trump did not ask for the letters in advance, and that White House officials had no idea they were coming. But several other people familiar with the events said Trump had talked about the firing for more than a week, and the letters were written to give him a rationale for firing Comey. The decision marked a turnabout for Trump. On the campaign trail, the candidate led chants of “Lock her up!” and praised Comey’s “guts” in October for reopening the probe into her email server. He joked openly with Comey at the White House two days after the inauguration. Trump, one White House official said, believed Comey was too soft on Clinton — not too unfair, as Rosenstein’s letter Tuesday indicated. At FBI headquarters, one senior official said the bureau was essentially in lockdown, not answering calls flooding in and referring all questions to the Justice Department. “I got nothing for you. Sorry,” said the official. “We were caught totally off guard. But we are not commenting in any kind of way, and referring calls to DOJ.” Comey had flown on an FBI plane to Los Angeles for a “diversity and recruiting” event. Trump’s director of Oval Office operations, longtime security aide Keith Schiller, hand-delivered the dismissal letter to FBI headquarters. By Tuesday evening, the shock that had spread throughout the ranks of current and former FBI officials was mixed with a growing sense of anger among the many Comey loyalists, and demands for answers as to why the director had been fired — and why now. “We just have no idea why this happened. No idea,” said one recently retired top FBI official who worked closely with Comey on many high-profile investigations. “No one knew this was coming. Everyone is just shocked that this happened.” There was no immediate front-runner for the vacancy, one White House official said. “If there’s a list, I haven’t seen it,” said one senior White House official. While shock dominated much of the FBI and the White House, the mood at Roger Stone’s house in Florida was one of elation. Several Stone allies and friends said Stone, a Trump associate who has been frequently mentioned in the investigation, encouraged the president to fire Comey in conversations in recent weeks. On Twitter, Stone signaled praise for the move by posting an image of Trump from “The Apprentice” saying, “You’re fired.” Stone declined to comment Tuesday night but said he was enjoying a fine cigar.

This news provides a possible explanation for the timing of Trump’s stunning decision. Comey met last week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, after the Senate Intelligence Committee had asked the FBI director to accelerate the bureau’s investigation. Rosenstein wrote a memo that provided Trump’s reasoning for firing Comey on Tuesday night, titled “Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI.” Rosenstein wrote that he had recommended Comey be fired because the director “made serious mistakes” in how he handled Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s private emails. Sarah Isgur Flores, the Justice Department’s top spokeswoman, told HuffPost that the reports regarding Comey asking for more money were “totally false.” Trump did not offer an explanation for Comey’s sudden dismissal, telling reporters on Wednesday that he’d fired the director simply “because he was not doing a good job.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"President Trump fired the head of the FBI, James Comey, due to Comey's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. Trump had grown increasingly angry with the Russia investigation and did not give Comey any prior warning of his dismissal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Speedpass is a keychain RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) device introduced in 1997 by Mobil Oil Corporation, now ExxonMobil, for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone, a company known for providing technology solutions for electronic payments. When Speedpass was launched, it represented a significant innovation in the field of contactless payments, making it more convenient for customers to pay for goods and services, particularly at gas stations and convenience stores. The device is designed to be attached to a keychain, allowing users to simply wave the device in front of a reader to complete transactions. RFID technology used in the Speedpass system enables devices to store information and communicate with other devices through the use of radiofrequency signals. In the case of Speedpass, the device is linked to a customer's credit or debit card account, which is then billed for the purchases made using the Speedpass device. The development of Speedpass by Verifone was a joint effort between the technology company and Mobil Oil Corporation, with both companies seeking to improve and streamline the payment process for customers. The small, portable nature of the Speedpass device, as well as the ease of use it offered, made it attractive to consumers who were looking for faster and more convenient payment options. The adoption of Speedpass quickly expanded throughout the United States, with millions of consumers across the country making use of the convenient payment method. In addition to gas stations and convenience stores, the system was eventually adopted by other businesses such as fast food chains, parking lots, and even some vending machines. Since its introduction, the technology behind Speedpass has evolved and improved considerably. Today, contactless payment systems like mobile payment platforms and NFC-enabled credit cards have become more prevalent, offering similar convenience to consumers. However, the Speedpass system played a crucial role in the development and popularization of contactless payments, paving the way for the various payment solutions we see today."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What painting possibly influenced the painting The Swimming Hole? from the following article ? Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

Article:","completion":"Title: Essential Tips for Stacking Hay Bales Properly: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Stacking hay bales effectively and safely is vital in preserving the quality of the hay while preventing unnecessary accidents and losses. Stacking them properly ensures that the bales retain their shape, remain accessible, and are protected from pests and dampness. In this article, we will elaborate on a step-by-step method for stacking hay bales on a pallet to maximize stability and optimize storage capacity. 1. Preparing the Stacking Area Before you start stacking the hay bales, it is essential to prepare the storage area. Choose a clean, dry, and well-ventilated place that keeps the hay protected from moisture, pests, and direct sunlight. Place a pallet or a platform on the ground to create a stable and elevated base for the hay bales, which helps in maintaining air circulation and prevents moisture accumulation. 2. Positioning the First Layer Place the first layer of hay bales on the pallet with their cut side facing up. This orientation ensures that the denser, more tightly bound side of the bale is in contact with the surface below, providing a stable base. Align the bales tightly together, side by side, covering the entire surface of the pallet without leaving any gaps. Packing the bales close together prevents them from shifting and increases the stability of the entire stack. 3. Stacking the Second Layer For the second layer of hay bales, place them on top of the first layer with the top side facing up, which is the opposite of the orientation you used for the first layer. This alternating placement pattern is crucial for maintaining the balance of the stack. Additionally, this arrangement allows for better ventilation between the bales, reducing the chances of mold growth and spoilage. 4. Continuing the Pattern For each subsequent layer of hay bales, continue alternating the direction of the bales as you stack them. This technique ensures that the hay bales interlock, providing stability and rigidity to the entire stack. Keep in mind that spacing between the bales can cause the stack to become unstable, so make sure you tuck the bales tightly together. 5. Four Layers for Optimal Stability While the number of layers you can stack may depend on various factors such as the height of your storage area or the type of hay you are storing, a general rule of thumb is to create a stack of four layers for most situations. This height provides the most optimal stability and weight distribution for the hay bales, preventing potential accidents or collapses. 6. Filling the Pallet to Capacity As you reach the final layer of the stack, make sure to fill the entire pallet space to capacity to maximize storage. Ensure that the top layer bales are also positioned tightly together, leaving no gaps between them. A full pallet is more stable and offers greater resistance to shifting or toppling compared to a partially filled one. Conclusion Stacking hay bales correctly is crucial for preserving the quality of your hay and preventing mishaps in your storage area. By following the guidelines outlined in this article, you can optimize available storage space and maintain a stable, safe, and efficiently managed haystack. Always remember to handle and stack hay bales with care and caution, as accidents can happen even with proper stacking techniques. Regularly inspect your stacks for signs of deterioration, instability, or pest infestation, and take appropriate action if necessary. By doing so, you will ensure a safe and long-lasting hay management system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of? Answer the above question based on the context below: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

How to remove something from your eye Blink your eyes rapidly. When you get dust, hair, or another small foreign body stuck in your eye, your body's natural response is to blink. Blinking rapidly may help move the debris, and allow any tears that may form to clear it out.","completion":"The next steps that most naturally follow are: 1. Wash Your Hands: Because your hands are always touching various surfaces, they harbor a lot of germs and bacteria. Therefore, before doing anything else, it's essential to wash your hands thoroughly to avoid worsening the situation by introducing more foreign bodies or bacteria into your eye. This is a fundamental hygiene practice, especially when your eye is irritated. 2. Use Saline Solution or Clean Water: If blinking doesn't remove the foreign object, you may then need to rinse your eye. It's advisable to use a saline solution if one is available. If not, clean, warm (but not hot) tap water can work too. Saline solutions or clean water help in flushing out the foreign objects from your eye safely. 3. Try to Locate and Remove the Foreign Object: If the irritation persists, try to look for the foreign object in your eye. You can do this by standing in front of a mirror. If you can see the object, try removing it gently with a damp clean cloth or tissue. But remember not to rub your eye as it can cause more irritation or even damage. 4. Consult a Healthcare Professional: If after all these steps, the foreign object still remains, or the irritation persists, it would be best to seek help from a healthcare professional. They have the expertise and appropriate tools to remove foreign bodies from the eye without causing damage. This is a necessary step, as leaving the foreign body in the eye could potentially lead to infections or other complications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - A category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface. The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on color, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs. - Philip Edward \\"Phil\\" Hartman (September 24, 1948May 28, 1998; born Hartmann) was a Canadian-American actor, voice actor, comedian, screenwriter and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film \\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\\" and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show \\"Pee-wee's Playhouse\\". - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - Houseguest is a 1995 comedy film starring Sinbad and Phil Hartman and directed by Randall Miller . 'houseguest' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'color'?

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians.

The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. - Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, RDI (born 15 May 1948 and originally christened Brian Peter George Eno) is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, writer, and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering work in ambient and electronic music as well as his contributions to rock, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. A self-described \\"non-musician\\", Eno has advocated a methodology of \\"theory over practice\\" throughout his career, and has helped to introduce a variety of unique recording techniques and conceptual approaches into contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. - Mistrial is the fourteenth solo album by rock musician Lou Reed , issued by RCA Records .

Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\".

In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. Sony Corporation bought the company in 1987 and renamed it Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - RCA Corporation, founded as the Radio Corporation of America, was an American electronics company in existence from 1919 to 1986. General Electric took over the company in late 1985 and split it up the following year. - The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place during the 1930s. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline. - The Velvet Underground was an American rock band from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's \\"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" events from 1966 to 1967. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground is now recognized as among the most influential bands of all time for its integration of rock music with the avant-garde. - Epic Records is an American record company.

News article: Eileen Gray's E1027 - review For a place built for peaceful retreat, Eileen Gray's E1027 house has endured more than its share of violence and strife. It was at the centre of a conflict between Gray and Le Corbusier, while a later owner was murdered there in 1996. Now its long-drawn-out restoration is provoking accusations of botching and disrespecting Gray's work. Delicate, white and ship-like, E1027 is perched above a bay on the Cote d'Azur whose wildness was, when it was finished in 1929, the opposite of the worldly charms of nearby Monte Carlo. The bisexual Gray designed it with input from her then lover Jean Badovici, as a refuge for them both, and the name intertwines their initials: the E is for Eileen, the 10 and the 2 for the tenth and second letters of the alphabet, J and B, and the 7 is for G. Until then a designer mostly of furniture and interiors, this was Gray's first house, and its spaces unfolded from the furnishings, designed by her, to the landscape. Other modernists, Corbusier included, treated their houses as statements, and as proud temple-like objects, into which chairs and tables (also manifestos of design intent) might be inserted. Gray was lighter, more playful, subtly and carefully attuned to the sun and wind. Too much so for Le Corbusier. In 1938 and 1939 he stayed there as a guest of Badovici, who had by then parted from Gray, and painted murals, crude and garish, on its walls. He did so, as one photograph records, nude. Seemingly affronted that a woman could create such a fine work of modernism, he asserted his dominion, like a urinating dog, over the territory. Gray saw his painting as a violation, and was furious. He, however, didn't stop there: he acquired land nearby and built his own retreat, a wooden cabanon, above the stretch of sea in which, in 1965, he would die. As an act of naked phallocracy, Corbusier's actions are hard to top, for which reason the E1027 story is now widely known and taught in architectural schools, as emblematic of the sexual politics of modern architecture. But the site is also significant for the grace and quality of the house, and for the rarity of its being designed by a woman: the architectural profession is still disproportionately male, and in the 1920s was much more so. Le Corbusier's cabanon, meanwhile, is also remarkable. Since 2000 Gray's house has been the responsibility of the commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, contracted to them by its owners, the Conservatoire du Littoral, and it has proved a burdensome responsibility for this small authority. They originally wanted to follow the advice of a young architect Renaud Barres, who had produced a study on the possible restoration of the house, and to work with another architect, Burkhardt Rukschcio, who has won awards for his restoration of modernist buildings. The Ministry of Culture, however, which supplied half the funding, encouraged the appointment of the chief architect for historic monuments in the region, Pierre-Antoine Gatier. Unquestionably knowledgeable about restoration, Gatier however had little experience of modern buildings. ¤600,000 and several years later the restoration is incomplete, and its permanent opening date uncertain. Barres and Rukschcio have produced a dossier which details, with convincing photographic evidence, departures from Gray's intent: thickening of metal rails, original glazing and light switches replaced by standard 21st-century products, a stair clumsily misplaced and mis-dimensioned, a colour scheme different from the 1929 version. It is also, for now, devoid of furniture, the originals having been sold through Sotheby's in the early 90s. As one Eileen Gray chair sold for 28m in 2009, breaking the record for 20th-century furniture, it is not feasible to return the originals, but without her pieces the interiors are quite unlike those she first made. Le Corbusier's repulsive paintings meanwhile, still dominate – the sane thing would be, if not to destroy them, to relocate them, but as they are also items of heritage this is unlikely. Jean-Louis Dedieu, the deputy mayor in charge of the project, defends it. Some adjustments of detail, he says, were necessary to deal with the corrosive effects of sea air, \\"while respecting the philosophy of the place\\". He cites as justification Eileen Gray's own words, that \\"nothing is fixed, everything must evolve\\". He has not, however, placated the critics: the architectural writer Michael Webb has described E1027's current state as \\"tragic\\", and Le Monde has got on the case. The British architect John Allan, who is experienced in restoring modernist buildings, found \\"disturbing evidence of a project that was poorly conceived and inadequately executed\\". It is not all doom and gloom. Thanks to the efforts of the commune E1027 is at least in a better state than it was in the late 90s, when it was close to disintegration. Zeev Aram, who runs the London modern furniture shop Aram Store, and who was a leading figure in the rediscovery of Gray in the 1970s, is supplying replica furniture. Eileen Gray is also the subject of a film, The Price of Desire, with Shannyn Sossamon and Alanis Morissette, being made by the Irish director Mary McGuckian. It will, says McGuckian, \\"be about the way she underpinned 20th-century architecture\\". She says that much of it will be centred on E1027, with Le Corbusier, played by Vincent Perez, portrayed as Salieri to Gray's Mozart. The film production is helping to support some parts of the restoration, including the replication of those lost light switches. The ever-increasing interest in Gray should also be to the good, and there is no shortage of eminent architects who would like to support a work of this significance. There is plenty of goodwill and interest, the only question being how they are directed. There is talk of a not-for-profit foundation taking over responsibility – in principle an excellent idea, depending on who exactly makes up the organisation. It would need real commitment and expertise, and no egomania. There is also talk that the whole site, including the cabanon, might be sorted out and made suitable for visiting by the time the next big anniversary comes round. This is 2015, the half-centenary of Le Corbusier's death. Even now, it seems, his colonisation of what was first Eileen's place is hard to escape. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about Eileen Gray's E1027 house, a beautiful building that she designed and built with her lover Jean Badovici in 1929. The house has had a troubled past, including a conflict between Gray and another famous architect, Le Corbusier, and a murder that took place there in 1996. Right now, Eileen Gray's E1027 house is being restored, but some people are unhappy with how the restoration is going. They say the people working on the house are not respecting Gray's design and not doing a good job. The furniture in the house has been sold, so it doesn't look like how Gray originally designed it. There is a new movie being made about Eileen Gray and her house called \\"The Price of Desire.\\" The people making the movie are helping with some parts of the restoration. Some people hope that a not-for-profit foundation might take over the responsibility for the house to make sure it is cared for properly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\". - The Philippine Revolution (Filipino: \\"Himagsikang Pilipino\\"), also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish, was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

At the close of August 1896 , members of the Katipunan secret society ( Katipuneros ) led by Andrés Bonifacio rose up in revolt somewhere in an area referred to as Kalookan , wider than the jurisdiction of present - day Caloocan City which may have overlapped into present - day Quezon City . Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts .

Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend.

Candying fruit, as mentioned earlier, is a preservation method that involves immersing the fruit in heated sugar syrup which eventually absorbs the moisture within the fruit, preventing spoilage through unfavorable osmotic pressure. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. In this scenario, Mary decided to candy the apples she received. On the other hand, Ann chose to eat her pears fresh. Fresh fruits, when not subjected to any preservation method, have a considerably shorter shelf life compared to candied fruits. Most pears have a shelf life ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on factors such as their ripeness, storage conditions, and variety. Given the difference in preservation methods chosen by Mary and Ann, the candied apples retained their quality longer than the fresh pears. Candied apples can last significantly longer due to the sugar content inhibiting microbial growth, whereas fresh pears will likely spoil within days or weeks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The declaration came after months of investigation and assessments surrounding the case. Jeremiah was last seen on September 14, but local authorities were not alerted to his disappearance until December when his sister reported being abused. The case has attracted considerable attention since the boy's disappearance, with public interest turning to mounting concern as law enforcement officials continue their efforts to locate him. Jeremiah's body has yet to be found, leading to increased speculation and intrigue regarding the reasons behind his disappearance. Elsa Oliver's mental state remained a subject of scrutiny during the initial phases of the legal process, but the recent judge's ruling confirmed her ability to comprehend the proceedings and actively participate in her forthcoming trial. This development marks a significant milestone in the case, as it allows the authorities to move forward with the trial process. While the case remains ongoing, tempers flared during a recent court appearance when Jeremiah's uncle, Sandrino Oliver, was physically removed from the Massachusetts courtroom following the judge's ruling on Elsa's mental state. It is clear that emotions remain high among those connected to the case, with frustration and a desire for answers continuing to mount. Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend are currently facing various charges in connection with the boy's disappearance.

In this case, it refers to the \\"clauses\\" or in German, \\"Klauseln.\\" 2. \\"sind\\" (are): This is the third person plural form of the verb \\"sein\\" (to be) in the present tense in German. It is used to describe the state or condition of something or someone. 3. \\"nichts anderes als\\" (nothing other than): This German phrase is used as a fixed expression to emphasize that something is exactly like something else or cannot be described in any other way. \\"Nichts\\" means \\"nothing,\\" \\"anderes\\" is an adjective that implies \\"other,\\" and \\"als\\" is a conjunction equivalent to \\"than\\" in English. 4. \\"ein eindrucksvoller Schuss\\" (a resounding shot): The indefinite article \\"ein\\" means \\"a\\" in English, while \\"eindrucksvoller\\" is an adjective derived from \\"eindrucksvoll\\" (impressive or striking) to describe that the shot is resounding or attention-grabbing. The noun \\"Schuss\\" translates to \\"shot\\" in English and could be used to describe gunfire or a metaphorical shot. 5. \\"ins Blaue\\" (in the dark): This idiomatic German expression literally means \\"into the blue\\" and metaphorically refers to something being a wild guess or attempt without any certainty of success, similar to the English expression \\"a shot in the dark.\\" The preposition \\"in\\" is contracted with the definite article \\"das\\" (the), forming \\"ins\\" in this case, and \\"Blaue\\" is a nominalized adjective that means \\"blue.\\" Putting everything together, the German translation \\"Diese Klauseln sind nichts anderes als ein eindrucksvoller Schuss ins Blaue\\" conveys the same meaning as the English phrase, emphasizing that the clauses are merely a bold attempt without any certainty of achieving the desired outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: The task is to generate the correct answer for a given math problem. Q: Problem: if the difference between the length and breadth of a rectangle is 23 m and its perimeter is 266 m , what is its area ? A:","completion":"The task here is asking us to find the area of a rectangle given the conditions: 1. The difference between the length and the breadth of the rectangle is 23 meters. 2. The rectangle's perimeter is 266 meters. The guidelines to approach this problem anticipate the application of the formulas that are usually associated with a rectangle, mainly the formulas for its perimeter and area. To find the solution, we must follow these steps: Step 1: Let's set up variables for what we know from the problem. We know that the difference between the length (L) and the breadth (W) of the rectangle is 23 meters, so we can express that as: L - W = 23 (equation 1) Step 2: We also know that the perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 266 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2L + 2W. We can express that as: 2L + 2W = 266 (equation 2) Step 3: Rewrite the equations to align with the same variable: Equation 1 can be written as L = W + 23. Step 4: Substitute this value from Equation 1 into Equation 2: 2(W + 23) + 2W = 266, 2W + 46 + 2W = 266, 4W + 46 = 266, 4W = 220, W = 55. Step 5: Substitute W= 55 into Equation 1 to find the value of L: L = 55 + 23 = 78 Step 6: Now that we have found the length (L) and breadth (W), use them to find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula, A = L*W. A = 78 * 55, A = 4290 m² That's it! The area of the rectangle is 4290 m²."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. Which person observed a loss in genetic diversity? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

He never had the opportunity to know his biological father, who had died before Carl was born. Franklin was raised by his mother and stepfather. While Franklin speaks highly of his stepfather and has called him \\"very loving,\\" he has spoken out about his stepfather's abusive tendencies, linking his outbursts to alcohol use. Context: Upon completion of a BA degree in Theater Arts, Franklin almost immediately moved to New York City with hopes of becoming an actor. One of his first jobs was acting in the New York Shakespeare Festival, where he appeared in the Twelfth Night, Timon of Athens, and Cymbeline. Pursuing his love of acting with an on-stage career, Franklin performed off-Broadway with The Public Theater. He has performed at many well-known public arenas such as Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York, as well as the Arena Stage (Washington, D.C.). With experience under his belt on the off-Broadway circuit, Franklin began his on-screen career with a film called Five on the Black Hand Side in 1973. From there, he acted in a string of guest roles on television shows such as The Rockford Files, Good Times, Caribe, The Incredible Hulk, McClain's Law, and The Streets of San Francisco. Over the years, Franklin's looks have typically landed him roles portraying men of power, such as members of the police force or military officials. Franklin's most recognizable acting role was his 1983-1985 portrayal of Captain Crane on the popular action-adventure series The A-Team. After two seasons on the show, Franklin realized that acting had become mundane and unsatisfying to him. He began to experiment with filmmaking, getting his feet wet with writing and production. Franklin is quoted in L.A. Weekly, saying \\"Acting made a director out of me.\\" And so, at age 37, Franklin made an important decision to return to school in 1986. This time, he chose the AFI Conservatory in Los Angeles, where he studied film directing, studying mostly the works of European and Japanese directors. He obtained his M.F.A. degree in directing in 1986. His time at AFI culminated in a life-changing project. For his master's thesis, Franklin produced a short film called Punk in 1989. The film follows the story of an African-American boy faced with the realities of familial stress, societal pressures, and the ever-daunting development of sexual discovery. Franklin's 30-minute film can be attributed to both failure and success. The production of the film cost Franklin his home and left him in a state of financial crisis, however, the impactful final product gained him attention in an industry that is nearly impossible to infiltrate. From there, his vision carried him through a successful career. Question: Did he act in any othe rmovies?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Carl Franklin acted in other movies besides Five on the Black Hand Side (1973). After making his film debut, Franklin continued to work in both television and cinema. In addition to his numerous guest appearances in television series mentioned earlier, some of his other notable film roles include: 1. High Velocity (1976) - A Philippines war drama film, where Franklin played the role of Clete. 2. Another Man, Another Chance (1977) - This film, also known as Un Autre Homme, Une Autre Chance, is a French Western movie, in which Franklin appeared as Simon. 3. Chameleons (1989) - A television movie, in which Franklin portrayed the character of Detective Garry Lennox. While Carl Franklin's acting career contains several film roles, it is important to note that he eventually began to feel limited in his acting pursuits. This led him to pursue filmmaking, screenwriting, and directing. His shift of focus from acting to filmmaking ultimately helped Franklin build a highly respected career as a director, with notable works such as One False Move (1992), Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), and Out of Time (2003). Despite having a more prolific career as a director, his acting experience played a significant role in laying the foundation for his accomplishments in the film industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As it turns 100 years old, a year-long celebration is being planned to honor this magnificent building, which attracts around 750,000 people daily. It is not only the sixth most-visited place in the world but also the largest train station globally, with 67 underground train tracks. Constructed back in February 1913, the enormous building's design has remained largely unchanged over the years. The majestic station lures visitors, shoppers, and passengers catching trains that commute through the station. Grand Central's main part showcases impressive arched windows, a sparkling four-sided clock, and ticket windows. Throughout the years, the station has also made numerous appearances in films. Dan Brucker, who has worked for the New York Transit Authority at Grand Central for three decades, still maintains his interest in the fascinating building. His work with the Transit Authority, which operates the station, allows him to contribute to and witness the history of the beloved structure. Justin Ferate, a historian who has been giving tours of the historic station for 30 years, highlights that the station was explicitly designed to make travel enjoyable for all. He explains how people do not run into each other in Grand Central. The reason behind this is the harmonious design involving various elements based on human proportions. Each block of stone in the station's construction measures the length of a person's leg, arm, and features varying colors, creating a checkerboard pattern. The modern preservation movement in the United States owes its existence to the fierce ten-year-long battle that took place in 1968 to prevent the construction of a massive office building over Grand Central Terminal. This struggle helped protect the architectural integrity and historical significance of the station. Today, nobody would consider altering the station's beauty and preserving its magnificence remains a priority for everyone involved.

Write a summary based on this article: Bill de Blasio, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of New York’s disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city’s 109th mayor on Tuesday. His landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central Brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast Queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at City Hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation’s largest metropolis. Mr. de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, defeated Joseph J. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, by a margin of about 49 percentage points, with 99 percent of the vote counted. It was the most sweeping victory in a mayor’s race since 1985, when Edward I. Koch won by 68 points, and it gave Mr. de Blasio what he said was an unmistakable mandate to pursue his liberal agenda. ||||| Bill de Blasio overwhelmingly was elected mayor Tuesday, becoming the first Democrat to lead New York in 20 years and ushering in an era of activist liberal governance in the nation’s largest city. With 84 percent of precincts reporting results, de Blasio was trouncing Republican Joe Lhota, a protégé of former mayor Rudy Giuliani, by 73 percent to 24 percent early Wednesday. De Blasio campaigned on a mantle of progressive change following Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s 12 years in office, highlighting what he saw as “a tale of two cities.” The moneyed Manhattan elite have had their mayor, he argued, and now the 46 percent of New Yorkers living at or near the poverty level need one of their own. De Blasio’s administration will be a laboratory of sorts for modern progressivism — testing whether an anti-establishment activist can effectively manage a sprawling municipal government and lessen growing inequality between the rich and poor. “Tackling inequality isn’t easy. It never has been, and it never will be,” de Blasio said in a victory speech at the YMCA gymnasium in his Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope. “The challenges we face have been decades in the making, and the problems we set out to address will not be solved overnight. But make no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path. And tonight we set forth on it — together, as one city.” 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Elections around the country View Photos From Detroit to Virginia, a look at some of the races drawing voters to the polls Tuesday.

But de Blasio also faces a series of immediate challenges as he takes charge of a city government with some 300,000 employees, a 70 billion budget and a dizzying web of intersecting interests. He will have to negotiate several city labor contracts that are due for renewal and overhaul the leadership of agencies, including the New York Police Department, which he has sharply criticized for the anti-crime policy known as “stop and frisk.” De Blasio also confronts serious obstacles to his tax policy agenda beyond the borders of this overwhelmingly Democratic city, including potential opposition from Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers in Albany. “He walks into a new experiment,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York Democratic strategist. “How does a mayor bridge the income gap? It’s a very difficult set of circumstances. The president hasn’t been able to do it. The governors haven’t been able to do it.” Despite New York’s overwhelmingly liberal tilt, de Blasio will become New York’s first Democratic mayor in 20 years. He will follow the reigns of Bloomberg, a billionaire Republican-turned- independent, and Rudy Giuliani, a law-and-order Republican who led the city as it recovered from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Lhota ran as a continuation of the Bloomberg years, while attacking de Blasio as a leftist, anti-police extremist. The New York Post featured de Blasio on its front page Monday above the headline, “Back to the USSR!” — a reference to a student trip by de Blasio to the Soviet Union 30 years ago. But the attacks gained little traction. De Blasio’s friends say he is at once principled and practical, and that the business community will warm to him as he shifts from campaigning to governing. “He’s very reasonable,” said public relations strategist Matthew Hiltzik, a longtime friend. “He has a core set of beliefs, but he doesn’t go into things assuming he has all the answers.” A key pillar of de Blasio’s campaign was to expand pre- kindergarten classes — something President Obama has championed. De Blasio has said he would pay for it by raising taxes on residents making more than 500,000, subject to approval from the state legislature. Many de Blasio supporters believe his victory shows that talking plainly about higher taxes carries less political risk than assumed. “Most people regard raising taxes as a political killer, but Bill’s not afraid because he knows we need it,” Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said in an interview before a Monday campaign appearance with de Blasio in the Bronx. But legislative leaders in Albany are skittish about the issue, especially with lawmakers standing for reelection in 2014. Democrats control the Assembly in the state capital, but Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate. Cuomo, who would have to sign any tax law, has said he supports expanding pre-K programs, but opposes raising taxes. The tax debate will be an early test of the new mayor’s relationship with the governor, who was President Bill Clinton's Housing and Urban Development secretary when de Blasio worked as a HUD appointee in New York and New Jersey. Such ties are typical for de Blasio, 52, who has built a network over decades in New York politics. He was Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign manager during her 2000 Senate race, then served eight years on the New York City Council before being elected as the city’s public advocate in 2009. De Blasio’s blunt discussion of wealth has resonated with many voters, especially African Americans and disenchanted liberal whites. The issue helped fuel his surge from fourth place in a crowded Democratic field in early summer to head of the pack by the September primary, when he defeated City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. The Brooklyn resident has said he would become the first mayor in the city’s history with children enrolled in public schools. “He knows our issues because he has children in the trenches with us,” said Freddie Sneed Jr., 55, a truck driver. Jef Pollock, a New York-based pollster who worked on de Blasio’s 2009 campaign for public advocate, said de Blasio has built a diverse coalition of supporters by tapping into emotions surrounding income disparity and resentment over Bloomberg’s Manhattan-focused mayoralty. “That reliance on old-school, coalition politics, where we just assume that people are going to vote for the candidate who looks and sounds like them — that mold has been broken,” Pollock said. On the campaign trail, de Blasio played up his solidarity with the often-neglected outer boroughs. At Monday’s rally in the Rochdale Village housing complex in Queens, city parks employee William Hightower said, “It’s about time we had change. “Classism here is a huge problem,” Hightower, 48, said. “It’s haves and have-nots. But he understands about the have-nots.” On Tuesday night, de Blasio’s victory speech was perfectly pitched to the have-nots. “The growing inequality we see, the crisis in affordability we face, it has been decades in the making,” de Blasio said. “But its slow creep upon this city cannot weaken our resolve, and it won’t.” |||||","completion":"Bill de Blasio became the 109th mayor of New York City in a big election win.

Centrist Emmanuel Macron is a long way ahead in the polls - so is there any way far-right leader Marine Le Pen could still pull off a shock victory in France's presidential election on 7 May? Since his impressive first-round victory on Sunday, Mr Macron is still at least 20 points ahead, which sounds an unassailable lead. The omens look good for him too. He won 8,657,326 votes on Sunday, almost a million more than his National Front runner-up. And the polls also suggest many voters from the other main candidates are likely to back him in the second round. He has strong backing from key political figures: outgoing Socialist President François Hollande and candidate Benoît Hamon on the left and defeated Republican candidate François Fillon and ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy on the right. So what could go wrong for him? Abstention is the biggest threat, says political scientist Aurélien Preud'homme. \\"If there is a very weak turnout for Macron and very strong support for Le Pen, she could go above 50% of the vote,\\" he told the BBC. Marine Le Pen does not even need to go above 50% in the polls to become president, according to one expert, as long as Macron voters stay away in big enough numbers. All she needs is to advance a little more in the polls, and this is how she could do it. \\"If she gets 42% of the vote, which isn't impossible, and Macron gets 58%, normally she loses the election,\\" physicist and Sciences Po political expert Serge Galam told RMC radio. \\"But if 90% of people who said they would vote for Le Pen do it, and at the same time only 65% of people who declared they would vote for Macron actually do it, then it's Marine Le Pen who wins the election with a score of 50.07%.\\" It is not that the polls are wrong, it is just that they cannot gauge the level of voter apathy in advance. Under Serge Galam's mathematical formula, he gives three examples of how Marine Le Pen can win, where she is candidate \\"A turnout x\\" and Emmanuel Macron is \\"B turnout y\\" with a Turnout (T). He calls this model \\"differentiated abstention\\". Whether or not the polls might fail, it is worth pointing out that almost all the polling organisations were uncannily accurate in predicting where the top six candidates would finish. US pollster Nate Silver gives Marine Le Pen no chance at all, arguing she is in a far worse hole than Donald Trump ever was. But Ian Bremmer of risk consultancy Eurasia Group puts the chance of a Le Pen victory at 30%. \\"I feel he's going to win but it's not a safe bet. It's significantly about turnout and there are externalities that are very plausible.\\" One of those external factors, he believes, might be a terrorist attack on a greater scale than the murder of policeman Xavier Jugelé in central Paris three days before the first round. Or perhaps an outbreak of fake news. It could happen, as the 7 May run-off comes in the middle of a holiday weekend. Why make a special effort to stay home and vote on Sunday when Monday is a public holiday? It could work both ways but the Macron vote is more city-based and more likely to venture away from home. Then there are the significant groups who cannot bring themselves to back an economic and social liberal in Emmanuel Macron. All of them are attracted to the hashtag #SansMoile7mai (Without me on 7 May). One is Sens Commun (Common Sense) a socially conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption. Their leader sees the \\"political decay\\" of Mr Macron as no different to the \\"chaos\\" offered by Le Pen. Historically, however, turnout in the second round is as high as 80%, so there would need to be a dramatic decline. The far-right leader has only a few days to claw back a 20-point deficit but she has hit the ground running since she polled 21.3% on Sunday, well behind her rival on 24%. She has already stolen the limelight with prime-time interviews two nights running on France's top two TV channels and a dramatic political stunt, upstaging her rival in front of striking workers at Amiens. By contrast Mr Macron has appeared flat-footed, beginning with a celebration party on Sunday night at a pricey Paris bistro and what sounded like a rebuke from President François Hollande. \\"We need to be extremely serious and mobilised and not think it's a done deal, because a vote is earned, it's fought for.\\" But the centrist favourite has begun to hit back and a lot will hang on the TV duel on 3 May. In earlier TV debates Mr Macron performed noticeably better than his National Front rival. Marine Le Pen has already achieved a record number of votes for her party and is even trying to distance herself from the brand by restyling herself as the people's candidate with ex-banker Emmanuel Macron as a \\"candidate of the oligarchy\\". The key lies with two blocs: the right wing of François Fillon's Republican support base and the radical left who opted for the surprise package of the first round, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Together the two candidates polled almost 40% of the vote. And Mr Mélenchon refuses to back either candidate, raising the possibility that a section of anti-globalisation voters could find common cause with Marine Le Pen. Political scientist Aurélien Preud'homme says many on the right too are leaning towards Marine Le Pen and it just depends on whether she can shift the focus during the final days of campaigning to her strongest suit, security and terrorism. Perhaps it was unsurprising that she was heading for Nice on Thursday for her first big election rally - where a Tunisian inspired by militant Islam killed 86 people on Bastille Day last July. \\"What stops the right backing Le Pen is Europe and the euro,\\" says Mr Preud'homme. Most Fillon voters are of a certain age and they're the ones who worry about leaving the euro - it would be very worrying for them.\\" Marine Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen has already said she should have adopted a more aggressive campaign style in the manner of Donald Trump. He overturned a double-digit lead over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the US election last November. But she has little time left and may not find enough voters to win over. It is worth remembering that when she won the first round of elections in six of France's 13 regions in 2015, she looked on course to change the course of French politics. But it never happened and her party was defeated in the second round. % Emmanuel Macron % Marine Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

Japan National Route 343 is a national highway of Japan connecting Rikuzentakata and Ōshū, both of which are in the Iwate Prefecture of Japan. This makes it part of the administrative territory of Iwate Prefecture. An administrative territorial entity refers to a territorial division which is part of a unitary state and has an administrative authority over its respective area. Iwate Prefecture fits this definition. It is one of Japan's administrative divisions (or prefectures), and National Route 343 is located within this division. Furthermore, the city of Iwate is included in this administrative territorial entity. The cities of Rikuzentakata and Ōshū that the National Route 343 connects are both a part of Iwate Prefecture's jurisdiction, meaning that this highway would be administratively overseen by the governing body of Iwate Prefecture. Iwate Prefecture is located in the Tohoku Region of Honshu Island in Japan, and it is one of the administrative divisions of Japan, known as prefectures. It is governed by a governor who is elected by the residents every four years, and its administrative duties include a range of areas such as education, transportation, and public work projects. Therefore, Iwate Prefecture is the administrative territorial entity in which Japan's National Route 343 is located. The city of Iwate is also a part of the Iwate Prefecture and thus, also associated with Japan National Route 343 by means of the administrative territorial entity. Iwate city is a significant area within Iwate Prefecture and part of the region's governance jurisdiction. The city's geographical boundaries consist of mountains, rivers, and cultivated landscapes which Japan National Route 343 transverses to connect to other significant locations like Ōshū. Therefore, the Japan National Route 343 is placed within Iwate Prefecture, and by extension, Iwate city, making these two the linked entities through the \\"located in the administrative territorial entity\\" relation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Question: Who served as King's Council the year before Blackburne was nominated for the position? Passage:He was called to the Irish Bar in 1805 and practised with great success on the home circuit. Blackburne was nominated a King's Counsel in 1822 and administered the Insurrection Act in Limerick for two years, effectually restoring order in the district. In 1826 he became the King's Third Serjeant-at-law and in 1830 was advanced to the Second Serjeant. A year later, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in the Whig administration of Earl Grey 'though known to be a tory ... with a view to the Irish administration having a broad political base' and on this occasion was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. He held the post as Attorney-General until 1834; he was readmitted in 1841 and after serving for a year, became Master of the Rolls in Ireland. As Attorney General he clashed with Daniel O'Connell when he insisted, against O'Connell's wishes, on the appointment of Abraham Brewster as Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in effect, a deputy to Brewster himself). Blackburne's statement that he \\"would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment\\", is an indication of the influence which could then be wielded by a strong Attorney General. In 1845, he was chosen Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench. Blackburne was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in February 1852, but was replaced in October. After a break of four years, he became a Lord Justice of Appeal. In 1858 'he was invited by Lord Derby again to become lord chancellor, but he declined on account of his advanced age and failing health. He changed his mind, however, and decided to accept Derby's offer but was told that the position had been offered to and accepted by Joseph Napier.' He was bitterly disappointed, referring to the decision as \\"a harsh and cruel blow\\". In 1866, he began a second term as Lord Chancellor, which ended with his death in the next year.

Question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the isotope becomes more stable happens, how will it affect the isotope woud emit more radiation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed states that if an isotope becomes more stable, it would emit more radiation. To assess the effect of this hypothesis on the process, let's analyze each step in the process, considering the perturbation. 1. An isotope has too many protons: This suggests that the isotope contains an imbalance in its atomic structure, leading to instability. 2. The isotope is unstable: The instability is due to an imbalance in the number of protons, causing the isotope to seek more stable configurations. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As the isotope experiences instability, it generally emits radiation to reduce excess energy and move towards a stable state. 4. The isotope decays: The emission of radiation causes the isotope to lose particles such as protons, electrons, or neutrons, leading to radioactive decay. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: As the isotope decays, it undergoes a change in atomic structure, losing particles and becoming a different element or isotope. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: After undergoing decay and particle loss, the isotope's atomic structure has changed, and it transforms into a different element or isotope. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: Once the isotope has reached a stable state, it stops decaying and emitting radiation. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, if the isotope becomes more stable, it suggests that the isotope is moving towards a balanced atomic structure. In this scenario, the isotope may experience reduced radioactive decay rates. Contrary to the perturbation hypothesis, a more stable isotope would generally emit less radiation instead of more radiation, as it is closer to a balanced, non-decaying state. So, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, but it is not a direct one. As the isotope becomes more stable, it will emit less radiation and might eventually stop decaying. This change contradicts the perturbation hypothesis, which stated that the isotope would emit more radiation as it becomes more stable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\" is that _ . A) there are some pests in the apple B) children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple C) there are always more pesticides on the apples produced in Britain D) the apple is too hard for children to eat The answer is:","completion":"B) children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple. The research conducted using the data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit, collected from supermarkets, indicates that children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit due to the pesticide residues on the fruit. The government's assurance of safe levels of pesticides may be misleading, as their method of measuring involves crushing a batch of 10 apples and taking an average reading of pesticide content. This internationally accepted method, however, does not account for variations in pesticide concentration on individual fruits, as some apples could contain a significantly higher percentage of the total pesticide residue. The research utilized mathematical modeling to measure the potential exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. These pesticides could have detrimental effects on children's health, including disruption of hormonal balance and a potential increased risk of cancer. The study did find some solace in the fact that British-grown fruit samples had lower pesticide levels compared to imported fruit, suggesting that by purchasing locally produced fruit, the danger from pesticide exposure could be somewhat reduced. Emily Diamand, one of Earth's senior food researchers and co-author of the report, further emphasizes the importance of supporting local fruit growers to minimize the potential risks associated with pesticide residues on children's health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The single, released in late July, was a number-one hit in the United States, and became a big international seller. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song for 1967 (the other two were #2 \\"The Letter\\" by the Box Tops and #1 \\"To Sir With Love\\" by Lulu). The song is ranked #412 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" and at #144 in Pitchfork's 200 Best Songs of the 1960s. The song is a first-person narrative to \\"sparse\\" musical accompaniment. It reveals a tale, mostly in the form of brief dialog extracts by the narrator's family at dinnertime, on the day that a local boy - and apparently friend of the narrator - jumped to his death from a nearby bridge. Throughout the song, the suicide and other tragedies are contrasted against the banality of everyday routine and polite conversation. The final verse conveys the quick passage of events and other deaths in a year's time. The song begins with the narrator, her brother and her father returning, after agricultural morning chores, to the family house for dinner (on June 3). After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, \\"Mama\\" says that she \\"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\\" that \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\". At the dinner table, the narrator's father appears unmoved and almost dismissive; he comments that \\"Billie Joe never had a lick o' [meaning, any] sense\\", and asks for the biscuits to be passed to him, and comments that he has \\"five more acres in the lower forty\\" to plow. Her brother seems somewhat taken aback (\\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\"), but follows the comment by asking for a second slice of pie. He recalls a prank that he and his friends played on the narrator, and that he saw her and Billie Joe talking after church a few days previously. The only person who seems genuinely upset is the narrator. Her mother - who eventually notices the narrator's abrupt and complete change of mood at the news - seems unable to realize she is affected by the news (\\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\\"). She shares other news instead, that a local preacher visited earlier in the day, and almost as an aside, that the preacher had mentioned seeing Billie Joe and a girl who looked very much like the narrator herself \\"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\" - the object they were throwing is not identified. But again, the narrator's mother fails to connect this in any way to her daughter's emotional distress. In the song's final verse, a year has passed, and brought more harm and pain. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson, but they have moved away to another town (\\"bought a store in Tupelo\\"). Their father died from an unspecified viral infection, and their mother has been depressed and despondent, and \\"doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything\\". The narrator is also affected by the malaise; the main change she describes in her own life, is that she often visits Choctaw Ridge and picks flowers there to drop from the Tallahatchie Bridge into the murky waters of the river where Billy Joe jumped to his death. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What does her mother do?","completion":"Her mother in the song \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\" cooks food for the family, shares news with them, and notices the narrator's change in mood at the dinner table but is unable to understand the reason behind it.

The kitchen appliances and items mentioned (toaster oven, package of english muffins, and a cereal bowl) are typically clean and dry environments. Slugs generally prefer wet areas. This makes it puzzling as to why slugs were discovered here. 3. Finally, slugs are not known for their ability to traverse up high rise buildings.

Point your feet forwards and place them just wider than your knees, which should be comfortably shoulder-width apart. This stance will already start to lower your center of gravity and give you a strong base. Shift your weight into the balls of your feet and lift your heels just slightly off the ground. Bend your knees and lower your body into a strong squat position. A good rule of thumb is that if you think you’re low enough, try to get lower. Focus on keeping your weight in the balls of your feet, but not in your toes, which will throw you off balance. To test how low your stance is, reach down with one hand. You should be able to touch the ground with your fingers. You should still be able to move easily; if you can’t, ease up on your squat just a bit. Keeping your weight low and centered on the balls of your feet will help you stop quickly, accelerate faster, and react better to the ball. Your back should be level from your shoulders to your hips and slightly arched, but not totally straight. To help you get a feel for the posture, reach your hands down to the ground while sticking your chest up. Your upper body will lean forward a bit, but keep your weight balanced. This stance might seem uncomfortable at first, but it will feel more natural with practice. Making sure your back is flat will protect it from injury while keeping you balanced. Experiment with placing your hands out to the sides, or placing one hand wide while keeping the other at the offensive player’s hip or using it to dig for the ball. Whatever you do, don’t let your hands fall to your sides. Your coach might have a specific hand placement they want you to use depending on how aggressive your defense is. If not, just focus on keeping your hands up and active. Try different positions and see what feels natural and effective.","completion":"Achieve a strong defensive stance in sports by placing feet wider than shoulder-width, lowering your body into a squat, keeping weight centered on the balls of your feet, maintaining a flat back, and experimenting with active hand placement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the Patriots struck first. Midway through the first quarter, Brady hit Gronk for a 45-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 7. Two plays later, Brady threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to LaFell, but the play was nullified by an illegal formation penalty, pushing the ball back to the 11. Two plays later Brady threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Martin, which counted, and the Patriots led 7-0.

The Patriots answered by reaching the Texans 25, but their stiff defense forced the Patriots to settle for a 43-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Texans responded with a second straight field goal, this one a 45-yarder. After both teams traded punts, the Patriots took advantage of great field position (the Texans 41) and increased their lead to 17-6 with Brady's 1-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski with just 0:14 seconds left in the half. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the second half, and, despite only reaching the Texans 31, Gostkowski was good from 49 yards away, and the Patriots led 20-6.

Dans ce modèle à un seul degré de liberté, l'amortissement de Case, qui est généralement utilisé pour décrire la dissipation d'énergie dans les systèmes mécaniques complexes soumis à des vibrations, est étroitement lié aux rapports d'amortissement hystérétique des matériaux constituant le sol et les pieux. L'amortissement hystérétique est un concept important en génie civil et en génie des structures, car il permet de décrire la manière dont les matériaux amortissent les vibrations et dissipent l'énergie lorsqu'ils sont soumis à des charges cycliques, telles que celles générées par les séismes ou les mouvements des vagues. Le modèle à un seul degré de liberté simplifie l'analyse des interactions entre le sol, les pieux et les structures qu'ils supportent, en supposant que le mouvement de l'ensemble du système peut être décrit par une seule variable, telle que le déplacement, la vitesse ou l'accélération. Grâce à cette simplification, il est possible d'étudier les relations entre les différents paramètres du système, tels que l'amortissement, la rigidité et la masse, et d'évaluer l'efficacité des mesures d'atténuation des vibrations mises en œuvre. En associant l'amortissement de Case aux rapports d'amortissement hystérétique, il est possible de prendre en compte les propriétés d'amortissement des matériaux du sol et des pieux et d'évaluer comment ces propriétés influencent la réponse dynamique du système. Cela permet de mieux comprendre les mécanismes de transfert de charge et de déformation entre le sol, les pieux et les structures, et de concevoir des solutions d'ingénierie appropriées pour réduire les effets nuisibles des vibrations sur les structures et leurs fondations. En conclusion, le modèle à un seul degré de liberté est un outil précieux pour l'analyse des interactions sol-pieux-structure et pour l'évaluation de l'efficacité des mesures d'amortissement en génie civil et en génie des structures. En reliant l'amortissement de Case aux rapports d'amortissement hystérétique des matériaux du sol et des pieux, ce modèle permet de mieux comprendre l'influence des propriétés d'amortissement sur la réponse dynamique du système et d'informer la conception des solutions d'atténuation des vibrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the last names of the two individuals who were convinced to purchase Spring Ice? , can you please find it? In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: In the Northland (at that time titled The Birches), Spring Ice, Moonlight and October (then titled The Hardwoods), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His Moonlight, Spring Ice and The Birches are among his best. In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects\\".In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left,...

If we take away 4 \\"b\\" blocks from the 7 \\"b\\" blocks, we will have 3 \\"b\\" blocks left. So, it becomes: 3 * b - 6 = 0 Now, let's find out how many blocks we need to add to -6 to make it equal to 0. If we add 6 blocks to -6, it will become 0. So we do this: 3 * b = 6 Finally, we need to find out how many times we have the 'b' in the 6. Since we have 3 \\"b\\" blocks equal to 6, we can find 'b' by dividing 6 by 3: b = 6 / 3 When we divide 6 by 3, we get: b = 2 So the answer is: b = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made. Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face. The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment. The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint \\"Precinct 707\\" on a cardboard wall. Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental. More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated. The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway. At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is. I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped? from the following article ? In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Information: - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Marines, also known as a marine corps or naval infantry, are an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land, as well as the execution of their own operations. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army like the \\"Troupes de marine\\" (French Marines) and \\"Givati Brigade\\" (Israeli Marines), or form an independent armed service branch like the United States Marine Corps. - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines. - Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816 September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War. - The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also known as Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, took place on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia Campaign. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. - Charles Sidney Winder ( October 18 , 1829 -- August 9 , 1862 ) , was a career United States Army officer and a Confederate general officer in the American Civil War . He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain . - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.

Answer the above question based on the context below: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate...

How is \\" Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand.\\" said in German?","completion":"\\"Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident, die palästinensische und israelische Wählerschaft haben uns in der Tat eine komplizierte Situation präsentiert.\\" In this translation, I've tried to convey the meaning of the original sentence while keeping in mind the nuances of the German language. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: - \\"Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident\\" is a formal and polite way of addressing the President in German, comparable to \\"Mr. President\\" in English. - \\"die palästinensische und israelische Wählerschaft\\" refers to the Palestinian and Israeli electorates. In German, the noun \\"Wählerschaft\\" represents the collective electorate, while the adjectives \\"palästinensische\\" and \\"israelische\\" refer to Palestinian and Israeli, respectively. - \\"haben uns in der Tat\\" translates to \\"have indeed\\" and is used to emphasize the fact that the situation is truly and without question complicated. - \\"eine komplizierte Situation\\" means \\"a complicated situation\\". It is worth noting that although the original English sentence uses the expression \\"dealt us a complicated hand\\" in a metaphorical sense, the German language doesn't have an exact equivalent expression. Therefore, I translated this to \\"eine komplizierte Situation\\", which conveys the same sentiment but in a more literal manner. - \\"präsentiert\\" is the past participle of the verb \\"präsentieren\\", which means \\"to present\\" or \\"to deal\\". In this context, it is used to indicate that the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have presented this complicated situation to the speaker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day.

As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated. - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. - System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to provide services to other software. Examples of system software include \\"operating systems\\", computational science software, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications. - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. What is the relationship between 'operating system service management' and 'process'?","completion":"Operating system service management and processes are closely related, yet they serve different functions within a computing system. To understand the relationship between the two, we must first define both terms. Operating system service management refers to the methods, mechanisms, and techniques that are responsible for controlling and managing system services within an operating system. System services are background tasks or processes that provide essential functionalities required for the proper functioning of the operating system and its applications. Examples of operating system service management tools include Microsoft Windows Service Control Manager, Apple macOS launchd, and Linux Systemd. A process, on the other hand, refers to an instance of a computer program that is being executed in a runtime environment. It consists of the program code and the current activity or state, such as variable values, program counter, and memory allocations. Processes are managed by the operating system, which oversees their creation, execution, and termination. Each process generally operates independently and is isolated from other processes that may be running concurrently, while sharing system resources like the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. Now, the relationship between operating system service management and processes can be described as follows: 1. Control and management: Operating system service management tools are responsible for managing processes as services within the context of the operating system. These tools perform tasks such as starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming services, as well as controlling their execution based on specific criteria or events. 2. Lifecycle management: The service management system helps manage the lifecycle of processes, from their initiation to termination, ensuring that they maintain their intended state and operate within defined parameters. This includes monitoring and managing resource usage, handling errors and exceptions, and maintaining the overall health and stability of the system. 3. Resource allocation: Both processes and services require access to system resources, such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices. The operating system service management tools help allocate and manage these resources among the running processes, preventing resource conflicts and ensuring the smooth operation of the system. 4. Inter-process communication: Operating system service management tools are responsible for facilitating communication between different processes and services, allowing them to exchange data and coordinate their activities. This can involve mechanisms like pipes, sockets, and shared memory. 5. Security and privilege management: Service management tools are also responsible for maintaining the security and access control of services and processes. This includes managing user and group permissions, process isolation, and managing the privileges granted to services or processes. In summary, the relationship between operating system service management and processes is that the service management tools are responsible for controlling and managing the execution of processes as services, ensuring their proper functioning within the runtime environment of the operating system. These tools allow the processes to share resources, communicate with each other, maintain their intended state, and operate securely and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The phrase \\"Miluju večírky\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. It is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. In English, this phrase can be translated as \\"I love parties.\\" Czech originated from the Proto-Slavic language, which is the common ancestor of all Slavic languages. The earliest written records of the Czech language can be traced back to the 12th century. Over time, Czech has undergone various changes and has been influenced by Latin, German, and other Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic. The Czech language uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritic marks, known as háček (ˇ) and kroužek (˚), which distinguish it from other languages that also use the Latin script. These diacritics are used to indicate vowel length, consonant palatalization, or changes in pronunciation. Czech grammar is highly inflected and follows a complex syntactical structure. It is characterized by its use of cases for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and even some numerals. There are seven cases in Czech: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Verbs in Czech are conjugated according to tense, mood, voice, aspect, and person. Czech vocabulary reflects its rich history and cultural heritage. Borrowed words from Latin and German are common in the language, as well as loanwords from other languages, such as English and French, which are continuously adopted through globalization and technological advancements. However, the Czech language also tends to create new words by compounding or modifying existing words, staying true to its Slavic roots. In the Czech Republic, the language holds a significant cultural and national importance. Czech literature has a long and storied history, with notable authors such as Franz Kafka, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera making significant contributions to world literature. The Czech language is also widely taught and studied in schools and universities, promoting its continued development and preservation as a living language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the animals that fear they have been abandoned? is inside the article: Chance (voiced by Michael J. Fox), an immature and disobedient American Bulldog and the narrator of the film, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford, but expresses no interest in his owner or being part of a family. He shares his home with Shadow (voiced by Don Ameche), a wise old Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's brother Peter, and Sassy (voiced by Sally Field), a smart-mouthed Himalayan cat owned by Jamie and Peter's sister Hope. That morning, the children's mother, Laura Burnford, marries Bob Seaver, and Chance manages to cause chaos by digging into the wedding cake in front of all the guests. Shortly after the wedding, the family has to move to San Francisco because Bob must temporarily relocate there for his job. They leave the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate, Laura's college friend. Shadow and Sassy start missing their owners immediately, but Chance sees it as an opportunity to explore and have fun. Later in the week, Kate goes on a cattle drive, leaving the animals to be looked after by her neighbor Frank. However, Frank does not see her message and thinks that she has taken them along, leaving the animals alone. Worried by the disappearance of their host, the animals fear they have been abandoned. Shadow, refusing to believe that his boy would abandon him, resolves to make his way home. Not wanting to be left alone on the ranch, Chance and Sassy decide to accompany Shadow on his journey., can you guess it ?","completion":"The names of the animals in the story who fear they have been abandoned are Chance, Shadow, and Sassy. These three characters are central to the film's narrative. Starting off with Chance, he is an American Bulldog who is immature and disobedient. Voiced by Michael J. Fox, Chance is the pet of a character named Jamie Burnford. Despite his owner's efforts, Chance doesn't show interest in his owner or in being part of a family. He is also the narrator of the film, providing an interesting perspective on the events occurring in the story. Another character is Shadow, an old and wise Golden Retriever. Shadow is owned by Jamie's brother, Peter, and is voiced by Don Ameche. Unlike Chance, Shadow misses his owner immediately when the family moves away and they are left at a ranch. He also refuses to believe that his owner would abandon him and decides to embark on a journey to find his way home. The third character is Sassy, a smart-mouthed Himalayan cat. Sassy is owned by Hope, the sister of Jamie and Peter. She is voiced by Sally Field and, similar to Shadow, also misses her owners when they relocate and starts fearing that she has been abandoned. When their temporary caretaker, Kate, leaves them alone on the ranch, the animals fear of abandonment grows stronger. Their fear is further fueled by a misunderstanding between Kate and a neighbor named Frank, who mistakenly thinks that Kate has taken the pets along with her on a cattle drive. In response to this fear and misunderstanding, the pets - led by Shadow's resolve - embark on their journey home. In conclusion, these three pets - Chance, Shadow, and Sassy - experience feelings of fear and anxiety about being abandoned by their owners, which leads them on an adventurous journey home. Their emotions and their actions are central to the movie's plot and narrative, shedding light on the profound bond of loyalty and affection that can exist between pets and their human companions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Reign of Fire Context: The film opens in the undated past. During construction on the London Underground, workers penetrate an underground cave. A huge dragon emerges from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen (Alice Krige) -- the construction crew chiefâis crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. After the dragons reawaken, humanity resists with military force, including with nuclear weapons in 2010. This, however, only hastens the destruction, and within a few years, humans are nearly extinct. In 2020, Quinn (Christian Bale) leads a community of survivors in a Northumberland castle. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie (David Kennedy) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon; one man is killed, and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy (Gerard Butler), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping. The Kentucky Irregulars, a group of Americans led by Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), arrive with a Chieftain tank and AgustaWestland AW109 utility helicopter, the latter of which is piloted by Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco).

I submitted a profit and loss statement for my business to qualify for a loan, but the bank refused because the","completion":"document was incomplete. To resolve this issue, it is crucial to understand both the contents of a profit and loss statement as well as the reasons why a bank might refuse a loan based on this document. A profit and loss (P&L) statement, also known as an income statement, is a financial statement used by businesses to summarize the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, or annually). It provides information about a company's ability to generate profit by increasing revenue, reducing costs, or doing both. The P&L statement includes key parts, such as: 1. Revenue: This is the money you earn from your business operations. It might be broken down into categories, such as sales and service revenue, based on the nature of the business. 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are the costs directly tied to your production or provision of goods and services. They may include costs for materials, direct labor, and product production. 3.Core operational expenses: These reflect the costs that go into running your company whether you make a sale or not. Examples include rent, utilities, insurance, salaries of non-production staff, and office supplies. 4. Depreciation and amortization: These lines indicate the diminishing value of assets over time. 5. Taxes, interest, and other expenses: Includes corporation tax, interest on loans, and other miscellaneous outgoings. 6. Net profit: This is the final line in your statement, which shows your business’s profits or losses over the stated accounting period. Now, coming to the possible reasons why the bank might have refused the business loan on the basis of your P&L statement. 1. Problems with profitability: If your P&L statement shows that the business is not profitable, i.e., the expenses are consistently greater than the income, this raises a red flag for the bank. They may perceive your business as a risky investment and can refuse a loan. 2. Incomplete or inaccurate information: While preparing the P&L statement, if any section has been left out or filled in incorrectly, it may lead to your financial statement being deemed incomplete. In such cases, the bank cannot assess the financial stability of the business. 3. Inconsistent Income: If your business shows irregular income, the bank may deem this as a sign of instability, leading to refusal of your business loan application. 4. Poor cash flow management: If a business's P&L statement shows poor cash flow management, i.e., lack of enough cash to cover the regular business expenses, it could lead to the refusal of a business loan application. 5. Past financial troubles: Historical data showing losses can impact your ability to secure a loan, as this paints a picture of financial instability. So, to rectify the refused loan issue based on your current P&L statement, understand which aspects the bank is having concerns with. If the P&L statement is inaccurate or incomplete, consult with an accountant or financial advisor to ensure it’s correct, precise, and presents a complete, up-to-date picture of your organization's financial situation. If profitability is the problem, develop a solid plan to boost sales, cut unnecessary expenses, and maximize operational efficiency. Reconsider your pricing strategy and review whether you can introduce new products or services to tap into a part of the market you haven't reached yet. With proper revisions, insight-driven financial management, and a cautious approach towards fiscal stability, you can refine your P&L Statement in a way that enhances your chances of securing a loan from the bank. Remember, banks generally want to lend, but they need to be assured that the risk is minimized and the borrower has the capacity to repay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Have you ever noticed that the more you have the more you want? Let's face it. Thinking our life is good enough doesn't come naturally to many people. When we have high expectations of everything in life we will run into disappointment. Only when we are aware that needs are different from desires can we live with satisfaction. Here are a few ideas to help you be happier with what you have and who you are. Focus on what you are thankful for. Most people want things to be better than they are, or when things are going well, we forget to appreciate what we have. Learn to reflect on how much better things are than they could be. Focus on what you are thankful for. Write down 5 things you are grateful for right now. When we hold onto regrets from decisions we have made, it can really poison our well-being. Many people regret something they can no longer change, which ends up holding them back from moving forward in a more positive manner. What happened in the past is done and gone, so work to stay present and be mindful of the current moment to find more joy and fulfillment. When we use other people as the measuring stick for our personal success and quality of life we are likely to be less satisfied. Social comparisons can provide useful information when we try to learn from others, but they also hold our perspective in a discontented position. Compare yourself less with others so you can be satisfied more. When you are focused on your big ambitions and future goals you might _ the daily pleasures that surround you. Learn to slow down and absorb the wonder and beauty around you. Stay present and focus on the task you're undertaking at the moment. Don't let the life pass you by because you're always on the go and distracted by ambition. Practice looking at life through the lens of contentment and it will become more natural.

Q: What was the reason behind you becoming a Wiccan? I had very bad experiences with the old angry bearded GOD in the Christian religion. He had turned his back on me. He had betrayed me time and time again. So, I left. Still wanting connection with a higher power, I hungered for connection. I liked communing with the Wiccan Gods. I also liked how They made me feel, at peace, and I felt I had the strength to change my own life for the better. They are always there for me. How did you find it? When I was a teen I heard the word Wicca. I didn’t know what that was. I was curious and decided to investigate it. So, the next day I went to a book store. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms. I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.” She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I purchased the book and took it home. With my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book. I found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true. The book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book. Have you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell? I did a prosperity spell once and got the opposite reaction I was hoping for. I lost all my income! I realized later my mistakes and redid the spell correctly and then got the results I truly wanted. Question: Why do you think the lady at the bookstore was happy to help the author? === The answer to the above question is a). She was helping a customer.. b). She was dislexic. c). She was Pagan and wanted to share her knowledge. d). not enough information. The answer is:","completion":"c). She was Pagan and wanted to share her knowledge. From the context in the passage, the lady at the bookstore seemed excited and was enthusiastic about helping the author when they inquired about Wicca. She guided them to the right section and suggested numerous books, showing her familiarity and personal interest in the topic. Although the passage does not explicitly state her motivations, it does reveal that she identified herself as a pagan, which suggests that she might have been eager to share her knowledge and help someone explore the path that she herself had chosen. It's important to note that helping a customer (option a) might have been part of her job, but it doesn't specifically explain her happiness or enthusiasm. The author of the passage was the one with dyslexia (option b), not the bookstore lady. There's no context suggesting option d).

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - in cinema - at the park - martorell - jeep - airplane Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option for the given question would be \\"in a cinema.\\" A person taking a seat to watch a movie is likely in a location specifically designed for that purpose: a cinema. A cinema, also known as a movie theater, is a venue that features a large screen, comfortable seating arrangements, and an audio system, all meant to enhance the movie-watching experience. Generally, people visit cinemas to enjoy the latest films, and the entire atmosphere is focused on providing the best possible experience for viewers. Other options like \\"at the park,\\" \\"martorell,\\" \\"jeep,\\" and \\"airplane\\" are not the most suitable choices for the scenario described. It is essential to understand each option's context to know why it is not the best answer. \\"At the park,\\" while technically possible, is not the most suitable option because parks are open spaces and typically do not have designated areas for movie-watching. While there might be instances where movies might be shown in a park, such as a special event or a film festival, it is not as common as watching a movie in a cinema. \\"Martorell\\" is a town in Spain, and there are many places within it, so this option does not provide a specific location for watching a movie. Additionally, it is unlikely that the word 'martorell' would be associated with movie-watching as a primary activity. A \\"jeep\\" is not a viable option because it is a vehicle primarily used for transportation and is not typically designed to provide a movie-watching experience. This choice would not be suitable as there are no clear indications that the person would be watching a movie in a moving vehicle. An \\"airplane\\" could be a possibility only if the scenario was different and focused on air travel. Airplanes often provide in-flight entertainment, including movies, for passengers. However, the given question's context does not mention anything about being on an airplane, and it is less common for a person to take a seat specifically to watch a movie on an airplane compared to a cinema. In conclusion, considering all the provided options, the most suitable answer is \\"in a cinema,\\" as it is a location explicitly designed for people to take a seat and watch movies in a comfortable and engaging environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their lineup currently consists of JT Woodruff (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Matt Ridenour (bass guitar, backing vocals) Mark McMillon (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Chris Popadak (drums, percussion). On November 24, 2007, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Casey Calvert died, leaving the band as a four-piece. Originally known as A Day in the Life, their first record was a demo entitled Four Bullets for One Girl. After one album (Nine Reasons to Say Goodbye), an EP, Paper Chromatography: The Fade from Dark to Light (which was later re-released as part of the compilation From Ohio With Love), and significant line-up changes, the band changed its name to Hawthorne Heights. On the DVD portion of The Silence in Black and White, drummer Eron Bucciarelli states that the band took their current name from the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Vocalist and guitarist JT Woodruff is the only original member. Their first album The Silence in Black and White, was recorded over a four-week period, and was released in 2004. The album was slow to build sales at first; however, soon the video for the song \\"Ohio Is for Lovers\\" began getting airplay on MTV, and the band enjoyed breakout success at radio as well as a growing nationwide fan base, and the album became Victory Records' highest selling debut. The Silence in Black and White peaked at number 56 on the Billboard charts. The singles \\"Niki FM\\" and \\"Silver Bullet\\" were released in 2005. When their second album If Only You Were Lonely was released on Feb 28, 2006, it debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts, powered by the lead single \\"Saying Sorry\\" which has received regular airplay on MTV, VH1 and Fuse. The Legion of Doom remixed a song from the album, entitled \\"Where Can I Stab Myself in the Ears?\\" and it appeared on the Underworld: Evolution Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. The remix was re-titled \\"Where Do I Stab Myself in the Ears\\". The band performed on the 2006 Nintendo Fusion Tour.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You will need to negotiate with different people, depending on who you are. Accordingly, you should figure out who to contact about making an offer for rights: If you are a publisher, then you should negotiate with the author’s agent or, if there is no agent, then with the author directly. Foreign publishers will probably need to contact the publishing house which published the book initially. They typically have specialist rights staff that you work with. Alternately, you may need to work with a sub-agent. Book publishers often offer the author an advance, which is an amount of money. The advance is usually deducted from future royalties. For example, if you offer a 10,000 advance, then the author doesn’t begin to receive royalties on each book sold until they have earned at least 10,000 in royalties. There is no easy way to determine how much an advance should be. If the author is unknown, then you might not need to offer any advance. Advances are also broken up and paid in installments. For example, one third may be paid upon accepting the manuscript, another third when the author delivers the manuscript, and the final third on publication. Royalties are standard and don’t vary much from contract to contract. However, you need to understand royalties before going into negotiations. Consider the following: Book royalties are typically calculated as a percentage of the retail price. For example, if a hardcover sells for 25.95 and the royalty rate is 15%, then the author gets around 3.90 per book. As a publisher, you might try to get the royalty based on the net price. This is the amount you receive as publisher after the book is sold. Royalty scales can be graduated. In other words, the royalty percentage increases as the number of books are sold. An author will want to know quite a bit of detail before agreeing to sign on with you. Accordingly, you should determine the following information before going any further: expected first run (e.g., 10,000 copies) proposed publication schedule local retail price your marketing plans the amount of your advance Call up the appropriate person (author, agent, publisher) and express interest in the work. You should be prepared to discuss how much you are willing to offer as an advance, as well as your expected first run. If what you are prepared to offer is far from what the author wants, they can decline to negotiate with you. You also should be prepared to talk about your publishing house. Ideally, you will have a brochure or a list of published works that you could share with the author or agent. This is particularly important if you are buying foreign rights, because the author might not be familiar with your reputation in a different country. Before moving on to draft a contract, you should reach agreement with the author on the details of publication. This will make the contract drafting much easier. Talk about the following: proposed formats for publication (e-book, paperback, hardback) whether the copyright will be in the author’s name or the publisher’s the applicable currency publication schedule length of license any additional rights (such as the right to re-license in your territory) proposed changes price and availability of electronic files who will obtain permission to reproduce illustrations or other images Summary:","completion":"When getting a book published, you talk to different people like authors, agents, or publishers, and discuss things like money, how many books to make, and how to share the book's earnings, so everyone is happy and the book can be made and sold."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Pope Francis ditches bulletproof Popemobile\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Pope Francis Ditches Bulletproof Popemobile Introduction: In an extraordinary move that reflects his commitment to approachability, humanity, and empathy, Pope Francis has chosen to ditch the famed bulletproof Popemobile in favor of more modest transportation means. This decision has not only stirred up conversations surrounding security measures for religious leaders but has also highlighted the modest nature of the 266th and current Pope of the Catholic Church. The Humble Beginnings: Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, hails from Argentina and has a reputation for living a simple and humble life. Before ascending to papacy, he was known to commute using public transportation in Buenos Aires and even lived in a small apartment, rather than the opulent archbishop's residence. Since his election as Pope in 2013, he has continued to live modestly, often surprising followers and the general public with his humble choices. Why Ditch the Bulletproof Popemobile? The bulletproof Popemobile was first introduced for Pope John Paul II after the assassination attempt on his life in 1981. Although Pope Francis's decision to abandon this security measure might appear risky, it aligns with his core principles of humility and accessibility. He believes that using the bulletproof vehicle distances him from the faithful who wish to interact with him and that nothing should stand between a religious leader and their followers. Pope Francis has been quoted as saying, \\"It's true that anything could happen, but let's face it; at my age, I don't have much to lose.\\" This lighthearted yet telling statement reflects the Pope's desire to live a more authentic life, regardless of potential security threats. Alternative Transportation: Without the bulletproof Popemobile, the Pope has opted for more conventional modes of transportation during his public appearances. A keen supporter of environmental conservation and climate change initiatives, he has used a compact electric vehicle outfitted with a Vatican City flag. Other times, he has opted for simple open-air vehicles, which have allowed him to be closer to the people he serves. In 2015, for example, Pope Francis used a Jeep Wrangler to travel around New York City during a visit to the United States. Security Concerns: Although Pope Francis's decision to ditch the bulletproof Popemobile may appear brave or even reckless in the face of past assassination attempts on popes, the Vatican's security forces continue to work tirelessly to ensure his safety during public events. Experts believe that the risks are managed effectively without compromising the Pope's desire for a more human and accessible image. The Impact on the Papacy: Pope Francis's choice to abandon the bulletproof Popemobile speaks volumes about his stance as a religious leader. By opting for more modest and environmentally friendly forms of transportation, he is sending a clear message about the importance of humility and ecological responsibility within the Catholic Church. Furthermore, by actively choosing to be closer to the faithful, he illustrates his commitment to a more open and inclusive church. In Conclusion: Pope Francis's decision to ditch the bulletproof Popemobile has been met with a wide range of reactions, from admiration for his courage and humility to concern for his safety.

Write an article based on this summary: – The town of Woodland, North Carolina, is taking a drubbing online after its town council not only shot down a proposed solar farm but put a moratorium on future similar projects. It wasn't the mere rejection, however, that's drawing ridicule but some of the comments made by local residents during the comment period as rounded up by the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald. The big one: A man voiced concern that \\"solar farms would suck up all the energy from the sun and businesses would not come to Woodland,\\" in the words of the newspaper. \\"You’re killing your town,\\" he told planning officials. \\"All the young people are going to move out.\\" A retired science teacher also worried that solar farms would interfere with photosynthesis and result in dead plants around town, and might even cause cancer. \\"I want to know what's going to happen,\\" she said. \\"I want information.\\" A representative from the company that floated the proposal assured everyone that solar panels make use only of the sunlight that hits them directly and \\"don’t draw additional sunlight,\\" but the nays still won the day. (The News-Herald notes that the town council had previously given the green light to three other solar farms.) The story is now generating not-so-flattering headlines all over.

Ars Technica, meanwhile, looks at satellite images to question one resident's contention that solar farms were becoming a nuisance in the area, while newspapers in the the UK and as far away as Australia are joining in to snigger at the idea of solar panels sucking up all the sun's energy.

Article:","completion":"Title: Woodland, North Carolina Faces Ridicule After Rejecting Solar Farm and Placing a Moratorium on Future Projects A recent decision in Woodland, North Carolina, has led to some online mockery directed at the town and its residents. The town council not only rejected a proposed solar farm project but also placed a moratorium on all similar future projects. What has drawn ridicule, however, are the concerns and comments expressed by local residents during the comment period, as reported by the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald. One resident argued that solar farms would \\"suck up all the energy from the sun,\\" leaving nothing for businesses, effectively \\"killing the town.\\" This claim was not supported by scientific evidence. The individual further stated that this would lead to young people moving out of the area in search of better opportunities. A retired science teacher voiced her concern that solar farms could interfere with photosynthesis, resulting in plant death around the town, and might even be a cause of cancer. She demanded more information about the potential impact of these projects. The representative from the company that proposed the solar farm project offered reassurances, stating that solar panels only make use of the sunlight that directly hits them, and they don't \\"draw additional sunlight.\\" However, despite these explanations, the decision to reject the project and place a moratorium on future solar initiatives was made. It should be noted that the town council had previously approved three other solar farm projects. The town's decision has generated unflattering headlines the world over. Science Alert labeled the situation with a simple \\"Wow,\\" while Ars Technica used satellite imagery to question one resident's claims that solar farms were becoming a nuisance in the area. Even international newspapers, from the UK to Australia, have been critical of the notion that solar panels might drain energy from the sun. While the rejection of the solar farm project in Woodland has ignited ridicule and disbelief, perhaps it can also serve as a call for increased education on the topic. As the need for renewable energy sources grows, communities worldwide must be willing to critically evaluate new technologies and challenge misconceptions to make informed decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Black's complices are killed and he can only scarcely escape by jumping from a bridge onto a running train. When he is all alone in his hideout, he receives a long distance call from a cousin in Africa. Black is asked to rob diamonds from a bank. His cousin makes him believe this was easily done. Black travels consequently to Africa. Once there, he has to realise that the responsible Africans he intends to rob are more sophisticated than he had thought. Moreover a group of Russian soldiers of fortune also wants to steal the diamonds. Black outsmarts them and retrieves the diamonds during their holdup. Unfortunately his cousin tries to betray him. That is his cousin's downfall. Now all on his own, Black is caught by a feisty female police agent. Soon both are hunted by vengeful former Russian commandos.

Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch.

There is a gathering of the king's subjects to hear details from the clergy as to why England has the right to claim the lands of the French. According to the clergy, by contract from previous encounters, the french must have a male heir, but at present have a female one, which effectually nullifies French royalty's claim to the french kingdom.The king warns the clergy to state the facts -- any other entreaty would lead to \\"much fall of blood,\\" which is expected due to the two contending kingdom's property.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Summarize: Many times, making out happens after a date night. If you've been eating or drinking, be sure you make an effort to assure your breath is fresh. If you're at your own place or his place, run to the bathroom and make quick use of mouth wash. You can also invest in Altoids, mint gum, or breath strips. You can buy all these products at a drugstore or your local market. A good make out session progresses gradually. As you lean in to kiss, allow things to happen at their own pace. Pay attention to the man's reactions; try to get a sense of what he likes and dislikes. Start off at a slow tempo and then, as things get heavier, move quicker and start using your tongue, hands, and other body parts. Many people enjoy some tongue during making out. If the man you're kissing seems to enjoy tongue, then don't hesitate to use your tongue during the make out session. If you want to allow the guy to take the lead, try opening your mouth slightly to show him you're interested. See if he initiates using his tongue. Sometimes, some mild teasing can really turn a guy on. In the middle of a kiss, pull back slightly and pull his head away from your face. Pause kissing for a few seconds and then resume. Many men get turned on by mild teasing during making out. Men, like women, have erogenous zones throughout the body. These are areas that respond sexually to physical contact. The neck and ears tend to have a lot of nerve endings. Try gently kissing or sucking a man's ears or neck during making out. This can be a huge turn on. The face is a sensual spot on a man's body.

It's called \\"the bends\\" because it can make people feel pain or bend over in discomfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less?

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who talks about the marble? is inside the article: Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

Q:Process: - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain. Question: suppose more electrostatic energy builds happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The perturbation of more electrostatic energy in the context of the question seems to be unrelated to the process of acid rain formation. Acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the burning of coal, which then reacts with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These compounds mix with water droplets in clouds and ultimately fall as acid rain. Electrostatic energy typically refers to the energy associated with the electric charge stored on an object or a system. While electrostatic forces can play a role in particle behavior and air quality, they do not directly influence the formation of acid rain or the amount of pollutants released from coal combustion. Moreover, clouds are already acting as effective condensation sites for acid rain formation, so it is unlikely that increasing electrostatic energy would have a significant effect on this process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the influence of more electrostatic energy on the formation of more acid rain in this scenario would likely have no effect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - Tuti Island (also spelled Tutti Island) is an island in Sudan where the White Nile and Blue Nile merge to form the main Nile. It is surrounded by the \\"Three Towns\\": Khartoum (the capital of Sudan), Omdurman (the largest city in Sudan), and Khartoum North (also known as Bahri, a large industrial center). Despite this, Tuti is home to only one small village (founded in the late 15th century), with grassland being the main makeup of the island. In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via several ferries that cross the river every so often, but now the Tuti Bridge, a modern suspension bridge, has been completed and can be used instead. Tuti Island is mainly agricultural and where Khartoum gets most of its supply of fruits and vegetables and therefore, you can find many farms situated all around the island, many of them still using manual methods of farming. You will find acres of green fields and lime groves. - The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is a modern suspension bridge linking between Tuti Island and the City of Khartoum that was completed in February 2008 . In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via ferries but thanks to the Tuti - Khartoum Bridge , easy access to the island is possible . The Tuti Bridge in Khartoum is considered to be the first suspension bridge to be constructed in Sudan and one of the first constructed in Africa . The concept design of the bridge was proposed by Alfatih Ahmed , with the final working design by A&A Company Its construction depended on new bridge technology , enabling the erection to be carried out using local expertise & equipment . The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is the first among a series of bridges that will connect the cities of Khartoum , Omdurman and Bahri ( North Khartoum ) , and will help to alleviate traffic throughout the cities . The development has immediately commercialized the previously isolated Tuti Island . - Lake Victoria (' in Luo; ' in Luganda; \\"\\" in Kinyarwanda and some Bantu languages) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River. - Omdurman (standard \\"Umm Durmn\\") is the largest city in Sudan and Khartoum State, lying on the western banks of the River Nile, opposite the capital, Khartoum. Omdurman has a population of 2,395,159 (2008) and is the national centre of commerce. With Khartoum and Khartoum North or Bahri, it forms the cultural and industrial heart of the nation. - The White Nile (\\"\\") is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. - Khartoum is the capital and second largest city of Sudan and Khartoum state. It is located at the confluence of the White Nile, flowing north from Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Ethiopia. The location where the two Niles meet is known as \\"\\"al-Mogran\\"\\" , meaning the confluence. The main Nile continues to flow north towards Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Khartoum North or Bahri (\\"al-Kharm Bar\\") is the third-largest city in the Republic of Sudan. It is located on the east bank of the Blue Nile near its confluence with the White and bridges connect it with Khartoum to its south and Omdurman to its west. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Sudan (\\"as-Sdn\\", ), also known as North Sudan and officially the Republic of the Sudan (\\"Jumhriyyat as-Sdn\\"), is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Before the Sudanese Civil War, South Sudan was part of Sudan but broke away in 2011. Its predominant religion is Islam. - The Blue Nile (transliterated: Abbay but pronounced \\"Abbai\\", \\"\\") is a river originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. With the White Nile, the river becomes one of the two major tributaries of the Nile. The upper course of the river is called the Abbay in Ethiopia, where many regard it as holy. Some Ethiopians have long identified the Blue Nile as the River Gihon mentioned as flowing out of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2 and \\"encircling the entire land of Cush\\". After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'tuti bridge' with the relationship of 'crosses'.

Just don't call him by a nickname. A cheeky teen who dared greet him with a breezy \\"How's it going, Manu\\" during an official outing near Paris on Monday was left red-faced after receiving a sharp dressing-down from the 40-year-old centrist. \\"No, you can't do that, no, no, no, no,\\" Macron told the youngster who was waiting with a group of schoolfriends to meet him during his visit to the Mont Valerien fort near Paris, where hundreds of French Resistance members were executed during World War II. \\"Sorry, Mr President,\\" the teenager said, looking abashed. But Macron was not about to let matters rest there. Admonishing the junior high school student, he said: \\"You're here, at an official ceremony and you should behave. You can play the fool but today it's the Marseillaise, the Chant des Partisans (French Resistance song), so you call me 'Mister President' or 'Sir'. Ok? There you go.\\" Delivering his coup de grace, Macron told the teen, who had begun by singing a few lines from the Socialist anthem The Internationale -- a dig at the president's pro-business reforms -- to \\"do things in the right order\\". \\"The day you want to start a revolution you study first in order to obtain a degree and feed yourself, ok? And then you can lecture others,\\" he said. The exchange, which was captured on camera, was widely shared on social media. It comes as Macron -- who adopted a regal, top-down style on taking office -- himself faces criticism for his at-times blunt language. In an official video shared by his office last week he complained that the French were spending a \\"crazy amount of dough\\" on social security. Macron's critics held the video up as evidence that the man they call the \\"president of the rich\\" lacked empathy with the poor. Last year, Macron also raised the hackles of the left by calling protesting opponents of his labour reforms \\"slackers\\". ||||| French President Emmanuel Macron scolded a teenage boy on Monday after he addressed the 40-year-old leader as \\"Manu,\\" a common French nickname for Macron's first name. The incident occurred during an event north of Paris commemorating former President Charles De Gaulle's call for popular resistance against Nazi German occupation during World War II.

When Susan Ardron emigrated to South Africa in 1975 communication with her family abruptly ended just a few years later. Completely unaware that she was battling against amnesia following a serious car accident her family presumed she had died. But now after 34 years, as her memory slowly started to come back, she has stunned her siblings by contacting them on Facebook. Still living in South Africa, the 61-year-old was given a helping hand to trace her family in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, by a family she stayed with in Johannesburg. And now, following the bolt out of the blue, her brother Colin, 39, and sisters Dawn, 58, Julie, 50 and Gail, 52, are desperately trying to obtain a passport for their sister to get her back home. Susan left for South Africa with her husband Sid and four young children but when her siblings failed to hear from her they made desperate attempts to find her through the Red Cross and Salvation Army. It has since emerged that a car crash left her struggling to remember her real identity, and left her even referring to herself as Katie. Her husband soon left with their four children, Joanna, 43, Jason, 40, Adele, 38, and Amanda, 36, returning to the UK, and Susan has yet to make full contact with them as she continues to try and come to terms with the gaps in her memory.

Following the memorial service for investigative reporter Joe Strombel, Strombel's spirit finds himself on the barge of death with several others, including a young woman who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman. The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British aristocrat with political ambitions, may be the Tarot Card Killer, a notorious serial killer of prostitutes, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim's body. Sondra Pransky is a beautiful but awkward American journalism student on vacation in London.

Q: Abstract: The class B glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) G protein-coupled receptor is a major target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Endogenous and mimetic GLP-1 peptides exhibit biased agonism—a difference in functional selectivity—that may provide improved therapeutic outcomes. Here we describe the structure of the human GLP-1 receptor in complex with the G protein-biased peptide exendin-P5 and a Gαs heterotrimer, determined at a global resolution of 3.3 Å. At the extracellular surface, the organization of extracellular loop 3 and proximal transmembrane segments differs between our exendin-P5-bound structure and previous GLP-1-bound GLP-1 receptor structure. At the intracellular face, there was a six-degree difference in the angle of the Gαs–α5 helix engagement between structures, which was propagated across the G protein heterotrimer. In addition, the structures differed in the rate and extent of conformational reorganization of the Gαs protein. Our structure provides insights into the molecular basis of biased agonism..

John III nicknamed \\"o Colonizador\\" was the King of Portugal and the Algarves from 13 December 1521 to 11 June 1557. He was the son of King Manuel I and Maria of Aragon, the third daughter of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. John succeeded his father in 1521, at the age of nineteen. During his rule, Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and in the New World through the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. John III's policy of reinforcing Portugal's bases in India secured Portugal's monopoly over the spice trade of cloves and nutmeg from the Maluku Islands, as a result of which John III has been called the \\"Grocer King\\". On the eve of his death in 1557, the Portuguese empire had a global dimension and spanned almost 1 billion acres . During his reign, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to make contact with both China, under the Ming Dynasty, and Japan, during the Muromachi period. He abandoned Muslim territories in North Africa in favor of trade with India and investment in Brazil. In Europe, he improved relations with the Baltic region and the Rhineland, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese trade. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Can you get a Second hand high from smoke outside? If somebody is smoking weed around me, is it possible to get high off of second hand smoke? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"To answer the questions, I will gather information related to secondhand smoke and its effects, especially in the context of marijuana. Step 1: Research about secondhand smoke from marijuana I found that secondhand smoke is the smoke that is exhaled by the person smoking and the smoke that comes from the burning end of the cigarette or marijuana joint. There have been few studies on the effects of marijuana secondhand smoke; however, these studies suggest that it is possible, although unlikely, for someone to experience a \\"contact high\\" from being in a closed, poorly ventilated space with heavy marijuana smoke. Step 2: Analyze the probability of getting high from secondhand smoke outside Since the studies on marijuana secondhand smoke consider closed and poorly ventilated spaces, it's important to take into account that the questions relate to outside smoke. Being outdoors with proper ventilation and fresh air makes it even less likely for a person to experience a contact high from secondhand marijuana smoke. Step 3: Answer the questions Based on the information gathered, yes, it is possible but very unlikely for someone to get high off of secondhand marijuana smoke outside.

He said at a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. \\"The problem of our planet is an urban problem,\\" Johnson said. He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics \\"to drive the greening and the improvement of our city\\" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent by 2025. Johnson said the key measure was being taken to solve problems relating to housing and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting -- installing lagging -- in large numbers of public buildings. Johnson proclaimed himself a \\"passionate cyclist\\" and said he would push ahead with cycle superhighways around London. London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 worn and used diesel buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles. In addition, there were also 32,000 taxis running on diesel fuel, which could be replaced by electric vehicles.

Which board game has a maximum score of 307: Twin Tin Bots or Take It Easy? A:","completion":"Take It Easy has a maximum score of 307. Take It Easy is a strategic board game designed by Peter Burley and is suitable for 1 to 8 players. It is a tile-placement game that combines elements of luck and strategy. Each player has a set of 27 hexagonal tiles, numbered from 1 to 9, with three different colored lines connecting the sides. The players' objective is to create connecting lines of the same color on their respective game boards to score points. In Take It Easy, the players draw tiles one at a time and place them on their boards, attempting to create long, unbroken lines of the same color from edge to edge. The placement of tiles is crucial; once a tile is placed, it cannot be moved. Therefore, players must plan wisely and adapt their strategies as the game progresses, as drawing undesirable tiles can negatively affect their overall scores. The scoring in Take It Easy is determined by multiplying the color value by the number of tiles that make up a completed line. The color values are as follows: - Yellow Lines: 1 point per tile - Blue Lines: 5 points per tile - Red Lines: 9 points per tile - Green Lines: 7 points per tile - Orange Lines: 3 points per tile To maximize points, players should focus on forming long lines and strategically placing high-value tiles. An optimal game, in which a player forms the longest possible lines in each color without any breaks, will result in a maximum score of 307 points. This score is achieved by completing one line of each color, with specific arrangements and lengths that maximize point values: - Yellow Line (9 tiles): 9 points - Blue Line (8 tiles): 40 points - Red Line (7 tiles): 63 points - Green Line (6 tiles): 42 points - Orange Line (5 tiles): 15 points - Yellow Line (4 tiles): 4 points - Blue Line (3 tiles): 15 points - Red Line (2 tiles): 18 points - Green Line (1 tile): 7 points Total: 9 + 40 + 63 + 42 + 15 + 4 + 15 + 18 + 7 = 307 In conclusion, Take It Easy is the board game with a maximum possible score of 307, achieved through careful tile placement, strategic planning, and the formation of the longest possible lines in each color."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In San Francisco, private investigator Sam Spade (Ricardo Cortez) and his partner Miles Archer (Walter Long) are approached by Ruth Wonderly (Bebe Daniels) to follow a man, Floyd Thursby, who allegedly ran off with her younger sister.

Summarize: Daniel O'Reilly is more commonly known as Dapper Laughs. He's released a novelty Christmas album on Spotify called Proper Naughty Christmas. He claims some of the proceeds will be going to help the homeless. But Shelter says it doesn't want a penny from the self-proclaimed ''proper lad''. Shelter's CEO Campbell Robb told Newsbeat: \\"The fact that 90,000 children will wake up homeless this Christmas is no joke. \\"Dapper Laughs's brand of 'comedy' - which is deeply offensive about homeless people, not to mention many others - is something we felt it was important to take a stand against. \\"The support from the public has been overwhelming and we've seen a fantastic rise in donations as a result, meaning Shelter can help even more people this Christmas.\\" It all kicked off when the website UsVsTh3m tweeted a link to a not-so positive review of the 14 track record. The album includes songs called A Walk To The Pub...With A Tramp, Cracking On To A Sweetheart and Leaving The Pub...With A Tramp. It's available on Spotify and according to the comedian will raise funds for homeless charities. But Shelter then said it would not be accepting any money from Dapper Laughs. The comedian rose to fame on the back of his Vine video account where he claims to give \\"lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geeza\\". The star of ITV2's Dapper Laughs: On The Pull has 144 million Vine viewings, 1.7 million followers on Facebook and another 362,000 on Twitter, but his comedy isn't for everyone. His clips, peppered with the catchphrases \\"she knows\\" and \\"proper moist\\", have been called sexist by viewers, and fellow comedians. Earlier this week Cardiff University students successfully petitioned for the cancellation of his show at their student union. The union said Dapper Laughs was banned after students complained that he \\"trivialised rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women.\\" Petition organiser and student Vicky Chandler said she was really pleased the union had placed students' wishes above profits. \\"It's been a hard campaign and we've received a lot of abuse from a minority of people but we are really happy we've been listened to,\\" she said. \\"Hopefully in the long run people will see that they can stand up about things they believe in and their voice will be heard. \\"It's been so great to see so many people standing up and supporting us. \\"It's started a talk about feminism and sexism on campus that I hope will continue.\\" Newsbeat contacted Dapper Laughs's management team but they refused to comment. But an ITV spokesman said: \\"Dapper Laughs: On The Pull features an established internet comedy character created by Daniel O'Reilly. \\"ITV2 commissioned a show in which this character is placed within a recognisable TV format, a dating advice show. \\"Comedy is subjective and we realise the content of the show might not be to everyone's taste. \\"We regret that any of our viewers were offended.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. and the situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Answer the following question: Who has more abnormal cells in their body?

I read this background article the other day: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. I am facing a new situation today: People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt.

Boy, 11, facing hate crime for setting fire to Jewish school bus An 11-year-old boy was charged with a hate crime after he was caught on security cameras setting fire to a Jewish school bus in Brooklyn — the neighborhood’s third anti-Semitic incident in four days, police sources said on Monday. Police say the adolescent and four other boys, ranging in age from 10 to 15, set the Yeshiva bus ablaze on Brooklyn Ave. near Lefferts Ave. in Crown Heights shortly before 6 p.m. Sunday, authorities said. Security video, obtained by the website CrownHeights.Info, shows the five children running into the bus with pieces of cardboard. Flames appear towards the front of the bus within seconds as the kids pile out. Within minutes, thick black smoke engulfs the yellow bus, which was parked outside Beth Rivkah, a private girls school, the video shows. Neighborhood residents said they were saddened to hear that a hate crime may have been perpetrated by such young boys. \\"It's terrible,\\" said Chani Klein, a parent at the school. \\"I'd like to see these kids get some help.\\" \\"I don't know why they would do that. Maybe they were just bored, or maybe it really was about hate. Either way they blew up a bus. They need help,\\" she said. The 11-year-old was charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime and arson as a hate crime. Cops are searching for the other four boys. Chaim Rosenstein, 26, who lives in the area, said the bias allegation has residents concerned. \\"It's very sad that there was just enough mischief and possibly bias and hate pent up up inside an 11-year-old,” he said. \\"People are very shocked,\\" Rosenstein added. \\"They're concerned.” Scorched prayer books a cell phone and a camera laid amongst the broken glass, seat cushion stuffing and charred detritus outside the bus. The bus, which is not clearly marked for Yeshiva transportation, is owned an operated by BSD Trans Corp. Leon Yavich, who owns the company, said he was not ready to suggest the children were motivated by hate. “I am not going to jump the gun and accuse these kids of a hate crime,” said Yavich, 54, who is Hasidic. “I will not accuse them of a hate crime simply for the fact that I have not spoken to them,” he said, adding, “my bus doesn’t have any Jewish markings. It doesn’t belong to the Yeshiva,” he said. No one was injured in the fire. Police sources said another Jewish school bus was targeted less than a mile away from the fire scene on Thursday. The bus driver told police he was driving down Eastern parkway when someone hurled a brick at it, shattering the driver side mirror around 2:25 p.m. near Albany Ave., the sources said. Then on Friday, a Jewish man reported to cops that a 13-year-old boy began shooting rubber bands at him at about the same time and location from the day earlier. When the man confronted the teen, the boy punched him in the face, according to the sources. Despite the punches, the man managed to grab the teen and hold on until police officers arrived, cop sources said. As of Sunday, there had been 110 hate-crimes across the city, an uptick from 91 such crimes when compared to the same time period in 2015.

The paragraph states that \\"the upper rock layers are much younger,\\" which suggests that the rocks closer to the surface of a volcano, including those on the actual surface, are of a younger age compared to deeper rock layers. This is because volcanic activity continually deposits new layers of rock and ash on top of older layers.

Write some highlights for the following article: The board showing two added minutes had just been held up and Croatia set about trying to salvage some pride. But the more those in blue shirts chased the ball, the further away it went. England, bursting with confidence and belief, were tormenting their hosts, sending them dizzy with possession as they dumped them out of Euro 2015. England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with a 4-2 aggregate win over Croatia in their play-off. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th straight victory. Croatia U21: Livakovic, Milos, Datkovic, Mitrovic, Milic, Pasalic (Caktas 67), Halilovic (Misic 79), Bradaric, Pjaca, Livaja, Rebic (Bagaric 33). Subs not used: Delac, Galovic, Perica, Brucic. Goals: Livaja 38. England U21: Butland, Dier, Moore, Gibson, Shaw, Hughes, Forster-Caskey, Carroll, Redmond (Ince 85), Kane, Berahino. Subs not used: Bond, Garbutt, Pritchard, Lascelles, Baker, Woodrow. Goals: Moore 9, Hughes 73. Booked: Hughes. Referee: Clement Turpin (France). And to think they say England never win with style. With the stakes high and the pressure intense, England secured a place at next summer’s Under 21 European Championship in a very un-English way. There was no scrapping, no backs against the wall, no bitten fingernails, just the smooth execution of meticulous planning and preparation. Thanks to goals from Leicester’s Liam Moore and Derby midfielder Will Hughes, giving them a 2-1 win on the night — 4-2 on aggregate — Gareth Southgate’s squad will head to the Czech Republic next summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy. As England were victorious in Vinkovci, playing football as it should be, Spain — winners of this competition in 2011 and 2013 — were falling by the wayside, as were Holland. Do not underestimate what an achievement it is to be in the finals of this tournament. Southgate has not put a foot wrong in the last 13 months and this game saw everything he has been working towards fall into place. England, even without many key players, dismantled Croatia and in the process laid down a blueprint for the future. Vinkovci, famed for being the town where the train broke down on Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, may have been a surprise destination for this game, but the hosts were welcoming and there was no sinister edge, as had been the case in Krusevac when England faced Serbia two years ago. Croatia almost had the perfect start, too. With just two minutes gone, they broke swiftly down England’s left and Marko Pjaca crossed for Mario Pasalic, who seemed certain to score with a right-foot half-volley, until Jack Butland intervened. England took the lead through Liam Moore (second left) in the first half in Vinkovci and never looked back. Moore slotted into the top corner from a set-piece in the ninth minute to extend England's aggregate advantage. Butland cannot get a game for Stoke but he is a cornerstone of this England team and the captain showed his worth with a magnificent instinctive save to thwart Pasalic. Given the delicate balance of this contest, it was a moment of great significance. Croatia had been bolstered by the presence of Barcelona B midfielder Alen Halilovic, one of the finest young talents in Europe. He had warmed up for this by playing 30 minutes for Croatia’s senior side on Monday night against Azerbaijan. Moore runs away to celebrate his goal having given England the lead in Vinkovci in the second leg of their play-off. Ante Rebic reacts in despair as England celebrate taking the lead in the second leg in Vinkovci. England, however, swiftly got back on an even keel and began passing the ball in the manner Southgate desires. They had willing runners, particularly in the shape of the eye-catching Nathan Redmond, and a belief they could cause Croatia problems. So it proved. In the eighth minute, a corner that had been won by the tenacity of Hughes was swung in by Tom Carroll and met flush on the volley by Moore, who jubilantly wheeled away after his shot had hit the roof of Croatia’s net. Moore had silenced the home supporters and given his team the confidence to look for the second goal that would have killed the tie.

England's two goalscorers Moore (left) and Hughes (centre) celebrate helping England qualify for the European U21 Championship. Croatian supporters get behind their team in the second leg of their play-off against England. It should have arrived in the 36th minute when Hughes surged into the area, but seemed reluctant to shoot. The ball fell to Redmond but his effort was straight at keeper Dominik Livakovic. In the next attack, a long ball was hit up field by Filip Bradaric and, as England’s defence dithered, Marko Livaja nipped in to score. Now Halilovic began to impress. One ball he played with outside of his left foot to launch an attack, having not broken his stride, was majestic. But half-time gave England the chance to regroup and they began the second period with a renewed sense of calm. This was England’s biggest test, but they were passing it with style. Saido Berahino might have won it in the 59th minute but his shot smashed against the post. No matter. Not long after, the outstanding Hughes waltzed forward and finished with aplomb. Cue celebrations. It was his 13th game and 10th consecutive win. And, for Southgate, it was just about perfect.","completion":"In 2014, England's Under 21 team played against Croatia's Under 21 team in a soccer match.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Baseball Wild Cards And Others With the baseball season finishing this weekend, teams are gearing up for the first scenes in the postseason drama, when two “wild card” teams in each league square off to decide who will be joining the playoff-bound division champions. Meanwhile, the term “wild card” has a political resonance as never before with the candidacy of Donald Trump. As Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) recently told the Huffington Post when asked to justify his support, “Trump is a wild card, and I’ll take a wild card over unworthy anytime.” “Wild card” has become a versatile term in sports and politics, with roots, naturally enough, in the game of poker. In the 1870s, decks of cards were manufactured with extra “jokers,” originally used as trump cards in the game of euchre. But poker players found their own use for joker cards, coming up with variants on the game where the joker could assume any value the player wishes. Players began experimenting with liberating other cards in the deck, particularly “deuces,” or twos, typically the least valuable cards in the game. This was called “deuces wild,” a phrase that shows up as early as 1896 in the New Harvard Song Book. The university’s Glee Club sang this about one of their members: “ Ben Stephenson looks just the same / He’s always ready for a game / Of deuces wild with aces up the sleeve— / You wouldn’t think he could deceive!” While “wild” in “deuces wild” functions as an adverb, the word soon got used as an adjective modifying “card.” In a 1916 story in the Chicago Tribune , Ring Lardner tells of a long night of poker that starts with “nothing wild,” with one player scoffing, “That’s the idear. Wild cards are a joke.” (As the night wears on, the group ends up playing with “fives, sixes, nines and jacks wild.”) “Wild card” made the move into football in 1959, when the NCAA agreed on a rule that allowed college teams to designate a “wild card” player who could come into a game at any time as a substitute. In 1970, football was also the first sport to introduce a “wild card” team into its playoff system, with the best team not to win a division joining the three division champs. Baseball followed suit when it expanded to three divisions in 1994, then added a second wild-card team per league in 2012. The phrase made its mark in politics as well, used to describe an unpredictable factor. In a Newsday column in 1964 about that year’s presidential race, Myron S. Waldman wrote, “In the great American game of politics, the surprise issue is the wild card.” “Wild card” also came to be applied to public figures who upend conventional expectations. During the Iran-Contra congressional hearings in 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported that committee members were having second thoughts about letting Col. Oliver North testify, “fearing he is a wild card that could upset their carefully prepared script.” Mr. Trump earned the label at the beginning of his improbable campaign last year, when a Wall Street Journal headline announced, “In Donald Trump Candidacy, GOP Strategists See a Wild Card.” Since then, the Trump card has remained wild.","completion":"As the baseball season draws to a close and wild card teams prepare for the playoffs, the term \\"wild card\\" has gained political significance with the candidacy of Donald Trump, who is often described as unpredictable. The term originated in the 1870s in poker, where extra \\"joker\\" cards were used to represent any value the player desired. Over time, the concept of a \\"wild card\\" in sports developed and was eventually incorporated into playoff systems for various sports, including football and baseball. The phrase has now found its way into politics, highlighting the unpredictable nature of some politicians and their impact on the political landscape."},{"prompt":"Children are very, very _ and have excellent memories. Around Christmas last year, we were heading to Grandma's house. The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \\"Mom, is that man homeless?\\" I told her I believed he was. We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked : \\"There he is! There he is!\\" and started rolling down her window. \\"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\\" she asked. I pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift. I looked in the front passenger seat, loaded with leftovers from Grandma's house, and handed those out to him as well. The man thanked us, he clutched my hand in his and I could feel the bitter cold of them.

With magnolia trees, removing healthy, if unattractive, branches may cause more harm than good. You should never prune more than 1/3 of the tree at once, so always start with branches that are either dying or already dead. Choose from: -- Every 1/3 of the tree should be dead and two branches should be healthy. A pruned tree will be able to turn colors from the other branches as opposed to the white ones you intend to remove. -- This will prolong the growth of the diseased of the branches. Also, because dead, diseased branches are usually dormant, prune the diseased branches at least twice a day. -- When in doubt, be conservative with what you trim. Magnolias are very sensitive to pruning. -- If you see dead and diseased branches, it's best to remove those as well. Other branches may require pruning to help the tree flourish, and you don't want old, unhealthy branches falling off. Answer:","completion":"When in doubt, be conservative with what you trim.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If more conservation occurs, it will have a \\"less\\" effect on deforestation. Conservation measures aim to preserve and protect natural resources, including forests, by promoting sustainable practices. As a result, when more conservation efforts are implemented, it reduces the likelihood of deforestation occurring. Through conservation, people use resources more efficiently and sustainably, allowing for better management of forests. As a consequence, there will be more trees available to help absorb the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which in turn helps mitigate the negative effects of climate change mentioned in the process.

New Orleans narcotics detective Anthony Stowe is a heroin addict who is teetering on the edge of oblivion, and he could not care less. At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma. Months later, he recovers to the point that he opens his eyes, and is transported to his and Valerie's house to recover properly.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (often simply referred to as Laugh-In) is an American sketch comedy television program that ran for 140 episodes from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973, on the NBC television network. It was hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Laugh-In originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). The title of the show was a play on the \\"love-ins\\" or \\"be-ins\\" of the 1960s hippie culture, terms that were, in turn, derived from \\"sit-ins\\", common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition. During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking \\"Sock it to me?\\" Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon's opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined. According to George Schlatter, the show's creator, \\"Humphrey later said that not doing it may have cost him the election\\", and \\"[Nixon] said the rest of his life that appearing on Laugh-In is what got him elected. And I believe that. And I've had to live with that.\\" In an episode of the ill-fated 1977 revival, a Nixon impersonator says \\"I invited the American people to sock-it-to-me.... you can stop now\\". On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Fast Talker shtick) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him \\"an irresistable letter\\" in which he promised to fly Buckley out to California \\"in an airplane with two right wings\\". At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing, noting that \\"you can't be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one\\".

Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness .

Spacesuits are bulky, heavy, and restrict movement, so the seats had to be designed to ensure that the astronauts could be securely fastened in and still operate the shuttle effectively. The space shuttle's seats were arranged in a configuration that allowed them to be adjusted and customized for each specific astronaut's body shape and size.

An amphibious home is a super cool house that can float on water like a boat whenever there is a flood. Just like a rubber duckie floats in your bathtub, this home will rise up when there is too much water around it and become a \\"free-floating pontoon\\". A pontoon is a kind of floating structure, like a big, flat and strong raft. So how does this work? Think of a playground seesaw. When one side goes up, the other side goes down, right? Now, imagine that instead of a seesaw, there's a house sitting on a giant floating raft. When water starts to rise around the house, the raft lifts the house with it, helping the house stay dry and safe. The people who want to build this amazing floating home have asked the big bosses who make the rules for permission, and they have said \\"yes\\"! This means that they can go ahead and start building this one-of-a-kind private dwelling. Building a home like this is a super smart idea, especially if the area near the river has flooded before. This amazing amphibious home will help keep the people who live inside it safe and cozy, even when the river gets too high. This cool idea could also help other people living near rivers and lakes in the future.

The Qatar foreign ministry has denied this, and proof is, unsurprisingly, difficult to find. But such an accusation has increasingly cropped up, particularly in terms of Qatar's prolific record of resolving hostage situations in Syria. Thirteen Greek orthodox nuns, an American journalist, and 45 Fijian peacekeepers are just some who have been released in the last 18 months with Qatar's and, it appears, often the Nusra Front's help. In the melange of designated terrorist and jihadist groups at play in Syria and Iraq, there is a vast spectrum ranging from the deranged like Islamic State (IS) to the more moderate groups like (the now defunct) Harakat Hazm that was supported by, among others, America. Being a directly affiliated al-Qaeda group, the Nusra Front is nearer the IS end of the spectrum. Yet, while the Qatari relationship with the Nusra Front appears to be far from straightforward with some of the state's initiatives failing, indicating some distance between the two, according to recent reports, Qatar appears to want to reform this relationship. This begs the question of why Qatar would want even loosely to associate itself with a group like the Nusra Front. Firstly, there are no \\"good choices\\" in Syria today. Qatar has surmised, it seems, that supporting or transforming the Nusra Front, is one of the \\"least worst\\" options. Secondly, the Nusra Front has pledged to concentrate its efforts on removing the Bashar al-Assad government, as opposed to attacking the \\"far enemy\\" (ie Western states). On this point, the Nusra Front is aligned tightly with Qatar, which also is implacably against the government and fundamentally believes that the situation in Syria will only improve if he is removed. This idea is also reflected in the Nusra Front's composition, which is far more Syrian-dominated than the foreign jihadist-magnet that is IS. Thirdly, with this goal in mind, and perhaps most crucially, the Nusra Front group is widely seen as one of the most effective groups operating in Syria against a wider backdrop of splintered groups whose powers are highly limited. The potential creation of an effective fighting force against IS (or the Syrian regime) is a significant draw for Qatar. Fourthly, Qatar possesses a small, young foreign ministry and it does not have a foreign intelligence service. Though far from alone on this issue, the state struggles to map the dynamic conflict and finds it difficult to plot the shifting actors. Instead, it seems that Qatar prefers to continue to support the people or groups with whom it already has relations. As the conflict inexorably deteriorated and groups became more and more extreme, it seems that Qatar, unable to chop and change support easily and wanting to retain relevance, maintained relations with its contacts in Syria, some of whom appear to have close affiliations with the Nusra Front. Nevertheless, the low-level Qatari contacts with this group (if, indeed, they do exist) are not sufficient to turn the tide in Syria, and rumours of such existing contacts have added fuel to the media frenzy that has alighted on Qatar and its allegedly nefarious links in recent years. Source: Quilliam Foundation Profile: Syria's Nusra Front New insight into Nusra Front This is why Qatar is hoping to bring the Nusra Front in from the cold. If the state can get the group to eschew its al-Qaeda affiliation and adhere to a broadly moderate Islamist platform, Qatar can officially commence, with Western blessing, the supply of one of the most effective fighting forces in Syria. Not an easy sell, but the promise of Qatar supplying a potential tsunami of support will prove to be a powerful negotiating tactic. Once again, the silence from Doha on this matter encourages speculation inferring that Qatar has some kind of a genuine sympathy with the goals of the likes of the Nusra Front. But the fact remains that Qatar is a key Western ally. It hosts a critical US military base, it grafted US and UK higher-education institutions and ideas onto its education system, and has long promoted the Middle East's most visible and powerful woman, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the Emir's mother. These are transparently not the policies of a state with sympathies for the likes of IS or al-Qaeda. Indeed, there is no chance that Qatar is doing this alone: the US and UK governments will certainly be involved in or at least apprised of Qatar's plans. And, with increasing desperation in the face of IS and Bashar al-Assad's resilience, a reformed, effective fighting force would be welcomed by the West. Indeed, the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, recently said that he would speak to anyone, including the Nusra Front, in the effort to save lives. Qatar is not the first state to reason that it is time to talk to groups that are unpalatable and extreme, but who are, nevertheless, influential. But the ultimate judgement on this emerging policy will rest on how well Qatar can manage this transition and if this new fighting force can alter the balance of power. The recent assassination of the Nusra Front's central military commander, Abu Hammam al-Shami, in Idlib, Syria, indicates the fluid nature of the conflict. Whether he was killed because of an internal disagreement about the putative negotiations to eschew the Nusra Front's al-Qaeda affiliation or not, this assassination indicates the daily changes at the tactical level that can have potentially profound strategic effects. In such a changeable, fractured operating environment, Qatar will not be able to engineer a clean break of the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda. But, in a context where the best that can be hoped for is the \\"least worst\\" solution, Qatar's plan is as viable as any other. Dr David Roberts is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London. He was the Director of the Qatar office of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). His book Qatar: Securing the Global Ambitions of a City State will be published in 2015.Follow him on Twitter @thegulfblog A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The claim that Qatar has ties with the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliated group, has been widely debated. Officially, the foreign ministry of Qatar denies such connections, yet amidst its record of mediating hostage situations in Syria, questions have risen about its relationship with this extremist group. The Nusra Front is known to be towards the extremist end of the spectrum and it's puzzling why Qatar would want to associate with such a group. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, Qatar may perceive itself as lacking good choices in the Syrian conflict and hence views supporting or transforming the Nusra Front as potentially the \\"least worst\\" option. Secondly, the Nusra Front aligns with Qatar on its stance against the Bashar al-Assad government. Thirdly, the Nusra Front is seen as one of the most effective groups in Syria, making them a strong ally for Qatar against more intense groups like the Islamic State (IS). Lastly, Qatar's lack of a foreign intelligence service makes mapping the conflict and understanding the shifting actors challenging, hence it tends to continue supporting groups it already has connections with. Despite having links with the Nusra Front, there is speculation that Qatar, with the help of the western states, is aiming to reform the group; with ambitions to incentivise them to renounce their al-Qaeda association and commit to a moderate Islamist platform. If successful, Qatar could officially commence supplying this reformed group, potentially creating a powerful fighting force in Syria. Qatar's silence on these matters, however, raises eyebrows. Nevertheless, it is important to note that Qatar has been a long-standing Western ally and it is unlikely it would undertake such a course of action without the awareness of its allies. The idea of reforming an extreme group like the Nusra Front into a potentially effective fighting force presents itself as a 'least worst' solution in the face of the desperate situations created by IS and the steadfast Bashar al-Assad. However, the fluid nature of the Syrian conflict and the complex dynamics of the Nusra Front makes such transition difficult. For example, the assassination of the Nusra Front's military commander, Abu Hammam al-Shami infers internal disagreements and changes in hierarchy that might affect negotiations on the ground. Therefore, a clean break of the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda mediated by Qatar is unlikely, but Qatar's proposition under the prevailing circumstances seems as feasible as any other solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! What kind of animal is Patch?

Given the question: Process: - Add water to a pot - Put the pot over a source of heat - Turn the heat on - Wait for a few minutes - Begin to observe small bubbles in the water - Wait until the water starts to bubble a lot - Wait until you can see steam rising from the water - Turn the heat source off - Take the pot off of the heat source. suppose weaker heat source happens, how will it affect less bubbles on water. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. A weaker heat source would have an indirect impact on the process of boiling water. This is because a weaker heat source will take more time to heat the water to its boiling point. As a result, the formation of bubbles would be delayed and less frequent, as the energy produced by the weaker heat source would not be sufficient enough to generate vigorous bubble formation in the water as quickly or efficiently as a stronger heat source would. The steps of the process involving the addition of water to a pot, putting the pot over a heat source, turning the heat source on, waiting for a few minutes, and taking the pot off the heat source would remain unaffected. However, the steps where you are supposed to observe small bubbles in the water before it starts to bubble a lot and finally see steam rising would be indirectly impacted by the weaker heat source. The slower rate at which the weaker heat source is heating the water will result in less bubble formation, and it will take more time for steam to rise from the water as the temperature will rise slowly. The weaker heat source, therefore, will not directly change any step in the process but will indirectly affect the efficiency of the steps involving the water heating and bubbling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Newly discovered human bones prove the first permanent English settlers in North America turned to cannibalism over the cruel winter of 1609-10, US researchers have said.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unearthing the Dark Secrets of Early English Settlers in North America: Cannibalism in the Winter of 1609-10 Introduction: The first permanent English settlers to reach the shores of North America were faced with numerous challenges: surviving harsh winters, encountering unfamiliar wildlife, and learning how to make do with limited resources. Despite these immense hardships, these early colonists persisted, eventually laying the foundation for the United States as we know it today. Recently, researchers have discovered chilling evidence that suggests these settlers engaged in the most desperate of acts to stave off starvation during a particularly cruel winter - cannibalism. This discovery sheds new light on the lengths to which humanity may go to survive in the most abysmal of circumstances. The Harsh Winter of 1609-10: In 1607, English settlers established a colony at Jamestown, Virginia, unwittingly setting the stage for a series of events that would culminate in the gruesome winter of 1609-10. This perilous period, commonly known as the \\"Starving Time,\\" saw the colonists driven to extreme measures to stay alive. The winter of 1609-10 was a perfect storm of misfortune for the Jamestown settlers. A severe drought, combined with a strained relationship with the native Powhatan tribe, led to a deepening food crisis. To further complicate matters, the colonists' attempts to preserve their rapidly shrinking food stores were largely unsuccessful, resulting in spoilage and a precarious supply chain. New Evidence of Cannibalism: Recent archaeological findings in the Jamestown area have provided tangible evidence of the settlers' descent into cannibalism. A team of researchers led by the Smithsonian Institution uncovered human remains that bore telltale signs of cannibalistic activity. The remains, belonging to a 14-year-old girl dubbed \\"Jane\\" by the research team, displayed clear markings of butchery. The discovery of these remains, which showed evidence of defleshing and cleaving of bones, suggests that the settlers resorted to consuming human flesh to prolong their survival. Acknowledging the Disturbing Past: Prior to these discoveries, cannibalism amongst Jamestown settlers had been hinted at in historical records, but conclusive evidence remained elusive. With this newfound substantiation, historians must confront the uncomfortable truth of the struggles that shaped the early colonization of North America. This latest archaeological revelation forces us to acknowledge the parallel between the Jamestown settlers' extreme measures and the historically maligned practices of the indigenous peoples they displaced. It offers a powerful reminder of the struggles so often glossed over in the story of America's founding. The Larger Implications: The Jamestown settlers' ordeal is far from an isolated episode of cannibalism driven by desperation. Instances of survival cannibalism have been documented throughout history, from the desperate survivors of the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846-47 to the Uruguayan rugby team that crashed in the Andes in 1972. This macabre find in Jamestown serves as a stark reminder of the human capacity to adapt - and, in some cases, transgress moral boundaries - in the face of overwhelming adversity. As climate change, political instability, and other global challenges cast an increasingly long shadow over society, the lessons learned from these early settlers are more relevant than ever. Conclusion: The unearthing of human remains from the winter of 1609-10 at Jamestown has shed new light on the horrifying lengths to which humanity may resort to ensure survival. As we grapple with a future that promises increasing challenges, these revelations underscore the essential need to build resilience and better understand the complexity of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970), nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer. He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

Here are possible answers to this question: - shrink - explode - diminish - get smaller - stagnant I believe the correct choice is \\"diminish\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice is \\"diminish.\\" This is because when Sam expected his money to grow, he anticipated an increase in his savings.

This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Question: \\"Why did the settlers of panama eventually fail aside from disease?\\" Context: \\"In 1695, the Scottish Parliament granted a charter to the Company of Scotland, which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of Panama. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The settlers of Panama eventually failed due to several factors aside from disease, including: 1. Hostility from neighboring Spanish colonists: As the Scottish settlement was established on the isthmus of Panama, it was in close proximity to the Spanish colonies of New Granada. Spanish colonists viewed the Scottish presence as a threat to their interests in the area, leading to tensions and conflict. This hostility made it difficult for the Scottish settlers to gain access to the resources they needed, establish trade, and find allies in the region. 2. Lack of experience and knowledge in managing a colony: The Scottish settlers were inexperienced in establishing and managing a colony, especially in a tropical environment that was unfamiliar to them. They were ill-equipped to deal with the challenges posed by the climate, geography, and local flora and fauna, which led to difficulties in establishing a sustainable food supply, constructing infrastructure, and other essential aspects of a functional settlement. 3. Insufficient resources and funding: The Darien scheme was a significant financial undertaking for Scotland, requiring a considerable amount of capital. However, the funding was not sufficient to support the long-term development and management of the settlement. Additionally, the scheme's financial failure made it difficult for the settlers to acquire much-needed support and resources from Scotland, further hindering their ability to overcome the challenges they faced. 4. Isolation from Scotland: The distance between Scotland and the isthmus of Panama made communication and the transportation of supplies extremely difficult. This isolation made it challenging for the settlers to receive reinforcement, support, and guidance from their homeland, diminishing their morale and ability to maintain the settlement. 5. Political pressure and consequences: The failure of the Darien scheme had significant political ramifications, as it demonstrated the difficulties Scotland faced in establishing an overseas empire independently. This realization played a crucial role in persuading both the English and Scottish governments to pursue a union of their countries, culminating in the 1707 Treaty of Union and the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The political focus on this union likely diverted attention and resources away from the struggling Panama settlement, contributing to its ultimate failure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OVER the past decade, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has demonstrated that it is among the best of the nation's industrial heavyweights when it comes to absorbing a punch. But can it throw one? The Pittsburgh-based giant was wounded several times in the 1970's by a series of costly and time-consuming events - an overseas bribery scandal, the decline and eventual sale of its well-known appliance business, a money-losing venture into urban housing development, quality-control problems with its large steam turbines, and a uranium contract dispute with billions of dollars at stake. Westinghouse not only survived, it emerged last year with most of its legal entanglements settled. Its newly slimmed-down operations generated record sales of 8.5 billion and record profits of 402.9 million. It also amassed a hoard of cash that enabled it to offer 646 million for the Teleprompter Corporation, the nation's largest cable television concern. Still, analysts today are more impressed with the company's past resiliency than with its prospects for the future. Because the vast majority of its revenue comes from the production, distribution, use and control of electricity - as has been true since the company was founded in 1886 - Westinghouse is deeply committed to the ''mature'' electrical equipment industry. Many of its products face wellentrenched competitors and others have questionable growth prospects. ''It is a turnaround situation that has turned,'' Robert McCoy, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, said. ''Now they really have their work cut out for them.'' With Westinghouse's common stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday at 30 1/8 - for a relatively low price/earnings ratio of 6 - Westinghouse's chairman, Robert E. Kirby, is sensitive about the reservations of analysts. He and other executives declined to be interviewed last month, in advance of the company's annual spring meeting with Wall Street analysts March 26. But it is not Westinghouse's current performance that concerns analysts; they are more interested in how the company will meet the challenges posed by increased foreign and domestic competition, changes in management techniques and shifts in demand. ''People don't believe Westinghouse can really deliver,'' said Kemp Fuller, an analyst at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden who has been one of the company's most resolute boosters. Part of the problem appears to be that many of the company's difficulties during the past decade were either caused or exacerbated by its own miscalculations. There is also a widely held perception that the company has often failed to take advantage of its strengths. ''Over the years, Westinghouse has had some great strengths in the technological area, but it has had trouble getting it all together strategically,'' Michael Porter, a strategic planning expert at the Harvard Business School, said. Doubters of the company's abilities cite several episodes in the 1970's that helped shape Westinghouse's current image. They point to the sale in 1974 of the company's large but ailing appliance business to White Consolidated Industries, which promptly returned it to profitability. They also mention a 300,000 fine assessed to the company after it pleaded guilty in 1978 to bribing Egypt's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Sultan. But the real blow, they say, was the company's miscalculation of the uranium market following the Arab oil embargo of 1973. In order to help market its nuclear-powered electric generating plants, Westinghouse had guaranteed delivery of uranium to utility customers at an average of 9.50 a pound into the 1990's. It counted on purchases in the open market, where prices were expected to remain below 10 a pound, to cover most of its obligations. Instead, prices skyrocketed and Westinghouse faced the prospect of having to acquire uranium at prices far higher than what it could charge on resale. (Analysts point with particular distress to the fact that the General Electric Company, which, at the time, also guaranteed uranium at fixed prices to utilities that purchased its nuclear power plants, had covered its exposure by contracting to purchase supplies at fixed prices.) IN September 1975, with uranium prices at 25 a pound and a possible liability of 2 billion, Westinghouse charged that the price increases had been engineered by an illegal cartel of uranium producers. For that reason, Westinghouse claimed, it was not obligated to fulfill its contracts. As expected, the utilities sued Westinghouse, and Westinghouse sued members of the alleged cartel. Although Westinghouse's move infuriated its customers, it proved to be financially adroit. Today, all but one of the suits against the company are settled, at a cost far below the outlay that would have been necessary to fulfill the contracts.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force . - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.

From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.

What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the... Answer:","completion":"The full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence, and perspective is Hieronymus Bosch.

Bosch was active during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and his works were predominantly characterized by fantastical and hallucinatory elements, often featuring moralistic and pessimistic themes. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bosch's art was largely free from Italian influences and did not adhere to the typical conventions of the Early Netherlandish painting style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Below are some tips for women traveling alone. Exercise hotel safety There are many ways you can make a solo stay at a hotel safer. At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later. Arrive during the day Arrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark. Keep your documents safe If you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money. Dress appropriately To avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Why was RealClearPolitics involved? - not enough information - analysts are a key indicator of Republican strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of party strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of Democratic strength heading into midterms A:","completion":"RealClearPolitics was involved as it is a non-partisan political news and polling data aggregator.

His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat.

As CBS2’s Scott Rapoport reported, police said the a man sporting a long beard and wearing all black went up to the guard at 6:15 p.m. this past Friday to tell him about the painting. The 46-year-old guard told the man not to touch the artwork and advised him to inform the staff at the information desk, police said. As the guard turned to walk away, the man smashed a glass bottle on the back of his head and shouted, “Do your job!” according to police. “Oh, really?” said museum visitor Jonah Diaz. “Wow, that’s ridiculous.” “It’s very sad and unfortunate,” said museum visitor Carrie Pozum. “I mean, this should just be a safe place to go and enjoy the art.” The suspect apparently cut his hand on the broken bottle, leaving a trail of blood through two galleries. Police followed the trail out the building, but were unable to find the suspect. The victim was treated at a hospital for a cut to his head. “It’s just terrible that that would have happened to somebody who’s just here doing their job,” said museum visitor Jenny McArdle, The suspect is described by police as a white male, 20 to 25 years old, standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Late Monday afternoon, the Met Museum released a statement reading: “The safety of our staff and visitors is our number one priority. We are grateful for the professionalism of our security team, and are working in coordination with the NYPD on this incident. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

Here is an article: The search giant, which restructured as a holding company called Alphabet in 2015, reached a market capitalization of 547 billion Tuesday morning, surpassing longstanding king-of-the-mountain Apple. When Google first went public in August 2004 with a market cap of about 23 billion, the company was known almost exclusively for its search engine. Gmail was just a few months old, Android was still its own startup, and Chrome had yet to be invented, to say nothing of Google’s more outlandish bets, such as building self-driving cars and solving death. Google’s search business remains a money-driver, now powering Alphabet’s many other initiatives. The restructuring offers some more transparency about the company, with the performance of Google itself broken out separately from things like smart thermostat maker Nest and idea incubator Google X. Investors have rewarded this additional transparency by adding an additional 100 billion to Alphabet’s market cap since the restructuring was announced in August 2015. Back when Google first went public, Apple was worth less than half of the search company. The struggling hardware maker was still expanding its one very successful product line: The iPod. The iPhone, which now drives the lion’s share of Apple’s revenue, was three years away. A year later, investors already seem to have forgotten why they used to love Apple. Some are worried that iPhone sales will slow as the smartphone market reaches maturity, while calls for the company to come up with another revolutionary product continue unabated. Apple’s market cap is now down more than 30% from its all-time high. Apple wouldn’t pass Google in market valuation until 2008. But from there the company reached never-before-seen heights, becoming the first 700 billion company early in 2015. Will Alphabet’s valuation continue to rise, or will it face a downturn similar to Apple’s? That will depend on two key factors. First, the Google part of Alphabet, which includes Google.com, YouTube and Android, must maintain its dominance of search and online video even as a host of younger competitors vie to control users’ time on mobile. Facebook, Snapchat and others threaten not only YouTube’s control of video but Google’s broader role as the gateway to information on the Internet. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s less mature businesses, which it has lumped together as “Other Bets,” will eventually have to prove they can be developed into moneymakers. For now, investors are patient. “Other Bets” lost a whopping 3.6 billion in 2015, but the success of Google’s core business still sent the company’s shares soaring after Monday’s earnings. But as Apple’s ongoing stock collapse shows, Wall Street will only wait so long for the next big thing.

It was not a regulatory body, regulation being achieved through the member authorities. Hypothesis: JAA helped to create common safety standards.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) helped create common safety standards from the given context. The context provides substantial information to support this hypothesis. The Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) was an associated body of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) that represented various civil aviation regulatory authorities from European States. These states chose to cooperate in developing and implementing shared safety regulatory standards and procedures for civil aviation. As an entity, the JAA acted as a medium for collaboration between these authorities, fostering the creation of a consistent set of safety standards that would ensure the well-being of passengers and the proper functioning of air transport across the participating European countries. It is important to note that the JAA in and of itself was not a regulatory body. This means that the JAA would not directly implement or enforce the safety standards it helped develop. Instead, its role was to facilitate cooperation among regulators of the member countries and develop these safety standards, with enforcement and regulation taking place through their respective member authorities. By acting as a coordinating organization, the JAA allowed the participating countries to share relevant knowledge, experience, and policy ideas to streamline their safety regulations, which in turn made air travel within the European region safer and more efficient. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) helped create common safety standards for aviation is supported by the context provided. The JAA played a crucial role in fostering partnerships between the civil aviation regulatory authorities of multiple European States, enabling them to work together to develop and implement consistent safety regulatory standards and procedures. This cooperation contributed to a safer and more unified aviation environment in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After Germany led the way with starting DST (German: Sommerzeit) during World War I on 30 April 1916 together with its allies to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts, the political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on 21 May 1916. US retailing and manufacturing interests led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but were opposed by railroads. The US's 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918. What year did the United States finally adopt Daylight Saving Time?","completion":"The United States first adopted Daylight Saving Time (DST) in 1918 during World War I to conserve fuel and utilize more daylight for productivity. The initial implementation began on March 31, 1918. However, after the war ended, DST was repealed in 1919 due to widespread opposition and inconsistencies in its adoption across states. In 1942, during World War II, the United States federally reintroduced DST as \\"War Time\\" under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which lasted until 1945. After the war, there was no federal law regulating DST usage, leading to confusion across different states and cities. It wasn't until 1966, with the passage of the Uniform Time Act, that a standardized system of observing DST was implemented across the United States. The Act stipulated that DST would begin on the last Sunday of April and end on the last Sunday of October, with an option for states to remain on Standard Time year-round. In 2007, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the duration of DST was extended. It now starts on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.

This will ensure you have clean clothes available every day and that your living area is not cluttered with dirty clothing. You should also make a point of washing your bed sheets and your bath towels once a week to ensure they stay clean and free of germs. You should also wash any blankets, rugs, or cleaning rags once a week so they stay fresh and dust free. You may designate one day of the week “laundry day”, such as Sunday, so you always do laundry once a week. . Whether you live in a house, an apartment, or you have a room at your parent’s place, you should make an effort to keep your area clean. This means doing daily cleaning like dusting, sweeping, and mopping the floors so they do not collect dust or dirt. You should also pick up after yourself and put any items you have been using away so they do not create clutter. You may decide to organize your area if it has become too messy and cluttered. Having a space that is organized will make it easier to keep it clean and tidy. When you are cleaning your area, you should use effective cleaning products. Make sure you use cleaning products to wipe down surfaces and to mop the floors. You should also use carpet cleaning products to clean any rugs or carpet in your area. You can also stay organized and on top of your household chores by making a schedule and sticking to the schedule. A schedule for chores may be ideal if there are multiple people living in your household, such as roommates or siblings. You should assign different chores to each person or rotate chores so they get done. For example, you may have chores like “cleaning the kitchen”, “taking out the garbage and the recycling”, “cleaning the bathroom”, and “sweeping the porch.” You should then agree to rotate the chores with the people in your home or assign each chore to one person. Try to hold yourself and others accountable for getting the chores done. Working together to do the chores as a team will make them much easier to tackle than having to do them on your own. You should also schedule in “deep cleans” of your home or living area. Doing a deep clean once a month will ensure your home stays clean and prevents the build up of dust and dirt. Start by decluttering any areas in your home. You should also start high and move your way down, focusing on cleaning your ceilings, your walls, and your baseboards. You may also vacuum your home from top to bottom and wash the windows inside and out to remove dust and dirt. You can also clean any blinds, drapes, or curtains with the brush attachment on the vacuum. You should also dust all surfaces in your home. Move any items on shelves or ledges and make sure you dust the entire surface. Sweep and mop the floors if you have hardwood, focusing on all the crevices and cracks in the floor.

(Because if there’s anyone who reflects the will of the people, it’s Madonna.) And traditional newspapers are already going on about Oprah as if she’s no longer alive.

No, that’s not a daily dose of feel-good-yes-I-can-isms, but it’s a schedule that leaves Oprah plenty of opportunities to remind us about what soap she prefers or how chummy she is with Jennifer Aniston.In the meantime, Winfrey isn’t exactly shying away from celebrity, either. (There is no way that a person who shares her camping trips with the planet is ever, ever going to abandon life in front of a camera.)

A: Answer:","completion":"D). Proteins DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, encodes instructions for the synthesis of protein molecules. Proteins are fundamental molecules essential for various biological processes in living organisms. They are involved in virtually every function within a cell, including the maintenance of cell structure, regulation of metabolic pathways, immune responses, muscle movements, and signal transduction. The genetic information stored in the DNA molecule is contained in its sequence of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). This genetic information is organized and divided into functional units called genes. Each gene possesses a specific sequence of nucleotides that provides the blueprint for a unique protein. The process by which genetic information in DNA is converted into proteins occurs in two stages: transcription and translation. During transcription, a segment of DNA containing the gene of interest is copied into a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is carried out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. The newly synthesized mRNA then migrates from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the process of translation takes place. During translation, ribosomes, which are molecular machines composed of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), read the genetic information encoded in the mRNA molecule. The ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence into a series of three-nucleotide units called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, the building blocks of proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which contain specific anticodon sequences, bind to the corresponding codons on the mRNA. The tRNA molecules also carry the appropriate amino acid that matches the codon they bind to. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, creating a growing polypeptide chain, which eventually folds into a functional protein. Thus, DNA encodes instructions for the synthesis of protein molecules. The proteins synthesized based on these instructions play crucial roles in various biological processes and help maintain the proper functioning of cells and the entire organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(-b) / -1 = 1 / -1 Now, the equation becomes: b = -1 So, the solution to the equation -b + 2 = 3 is: b = -1"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Would experiment B's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide?","completion":"Experiment B's hydroxide would have a larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide. This is because the ground NaOH particles expose more hydroxide ions to the HCl gas, allowing for a greater number of reactions to occur."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - death place is naples - signature is signature of marie clotilde de france , 1793.jpg - succession is queen consort of sardinia - reign is 16 october 1796 & ndash ; 7 march 1802 - mother is maria josepha of saxony - death date is 7 march 1802 - spouse is charles emmanuel iv of sardinia - house is house of savoy house of bourbon - father is louis , dauphin of france - birth date is 23 september 1759 - image is painting piedmont.jpg of marie clotilde of france while princess of - birth place is palace of versailles , france - religion is roman catholicism - consort is yes Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of '89, and again in '92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay. I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, \\"made in Canada,\\" ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes. I love the movie. It's a period piece set in the 1920's, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem.

Article: It is well known that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time and he was also a really great person. Here are some interesting things about him. When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too. Once in an exam a student asked him why all the questions were the same as last year's. Einstein replied the questions were the same but the answers were different! ,A, B, C, D,,.

The use of strong negative language: Words like \\"unbelievably bad,\\" \\"sick to your stomach,\\" \\"pathetic,\\" \\"awful,\\" and \\"predictable\\" indicate that the author has strong negative feelings about the movie. These words are associated with disappointment, lack of quality, and frustration, which contribute to an overall negative sentiment in the review. 2. Criticism of specific aspects: The author criticizes multiple aspects of the movie, including the plot, acting, and dialogue. Such criticism implies that the movie fails to meet the author's expectations in terms of storytelling, character development, and dialogue, which further contributes to the negative sentiment in the review. 3. Recommendation to avoid the movie: The author explicitly recommends people to \\"avoid at all costs,\\" suggesting that the movie is not worth watching. This statement implies that the author thinks the movie is a waste of time and money, reinforcing the overall negative sentiment in the review.

Given the below context: South Sister, also known as \\"Charity\\", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at 10,363 feet (3,159 m). The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria. Hodge Crest, a false peak, formed between 28,000 and 24,000 years ago, roughly around the same...

Answer the following question: Given the following context: The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and Lancashire County Council opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 Pevsner wrote: \\"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England.\\"The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford.

(CNN) -- After five and a half weeks in transit limbo, NSA leaker Edward Snowden was granted temporary one-year asylum in Russia on Thursday. The White House expressed \\"disappointment\\" and again raised the threat of possibly canceling the meeting between President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin next month when the U.S. president is scheduled to travel to Russia for the G-20 meeting in St. Petersburg. But just how disappointed should Washington be with this development? With Snowden being allowed to leave the transit area, the move can provide an opportunity for U.S. authorities to make contact with him somewhere in Moscow. It is my understanding that while Snowden has been in the transit area, it has not been possible for U.S. authorities to make contact with him, and this has been a real problem for Washington. Putin does not really like public discussions of state surveillance of citizens, even if they are U.S. citizens, and when he states the condition of staying in Russia that Snowden stop harming the United States, he probably means he wants an end to public revelations of further documents OPTIONS: - Andrew Kuchins claims to have. - Barack Obama claims to have. - CNN claims to have. - Edward Snowden claims to have. - G-20 claims to have. - Kuchins claims to have. - Moscow claims to have. - NSA claims to have. - Putin claims to have. - Russia claims to have. - Snowden claims to have. - St. Petersburg claims to have. - U.S. claims to have. - Vladimir Putin claims to have. - Washington claims to have. - White House claims to have.","completion":"As the story unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Edward Snowden claims to have more undisclosed information, and if U.S. authorities will successfully make contact with him in Moscow, ultimately shaping the future relationship between the United States and Russia."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Robin told my mom.

Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular. Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate. The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which the superhero genre was prominent.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Newspapers underwent significant changes in their comic content during the early 20th century to cater to the evolving tastes and interests of readers. This transformation can be observed through the following milestones: 1. Emergence of shorter, black-and-white daily strips: During the early 1900s, newspapers began featuring shorter comic strips that appeared daily, as opposed to their lengthier, full-color predecessors that were typically published once a week. 2. Success of Mutt and Jeff: In 1907, Bud Fisher's popular comic strip, Mutt and Jeff, set a successful precedent for the daily format and humorous stories. This success encouraged other newspapers to follow suit and incorporate similar content. 3. Shift towards adventure and drama genres: In the 1920s and 1930s, comic strips in newspapers began exploring various narrative-driven genres, including adventure and drama. These genres featuring continuing stories gained popularity among readers, providing a more diverse range of content for newspapers. 4. Introduction of comic books: Thin periodicals known as comic books emerged during the 1930s. Initially, these books reprinted popular newspaper comic strips, but by the end of the decade, original content started to dominate the comic book industry. 5. Golden Age of Comic Books: The late 1930s marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, a period characterized by the widespread popularity of superhero content. The success of Action Comics and its lead hero, Superman, in 1938 solidified the superhero genre as a prominent and defining aspect of comic book culture. In conclusion, newspapers changed their comic content over time by introducing shorter, daily comic strips, diversifying comic genres, and inspiring the invention of comic books. These changes helped shape the comic industry as we know it today, allowing for a broader range of stories and characters for readers to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which region had more species go extinct? Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's follow these steps: 1. Understand the information given: We are comparing extinction rates for two regions in Italy – Northern region with high abiotic stress and Southern region with low abiotic stress. 2. Analyze the hint given: As abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. More species are likely to become endangered or extinct in regions of higher abiotic stress. 3. Using the provided information and hint, we deduce that the Northern region, where animals are exposed to a higher level of abiotic stress, had more species go extinct compared to the Southern region.

Choices: (i). yes; (ii). it is not possible to tell; (iii). no;","completion":"(i). Yes The statement \\"The man in the blue jeans is trying to kick another man\\" inherently implies that there is a man who is performing an action on another man – specifically, kicking or attempting to kick. We can examine this statement in greater detail to understand the logical connections present: 1. First, there is a clear mention of \\"the man in the blue jeans,\\" which means there is at least one person involved in this scenario. This individual is described as wearing blue jeans, which pertain to the appearance and can denote that he can be easily identified as the one trying to kick. 2. Secondly, the statement highlights that this man is \\"trying to kick another man.\\" Here, the phrase \\"another man\\" implies the existence of a second individual. Thus, we have two people in this scenario. 3. Furthermore, the action being performed is \\"trying to kick.\\" This means that the man in the blue jeans is in the process of attempting to initiate a kicking action towards the second man. Considering these aspects of the statement, it reasonably and logically follows that the summary \\"A man trying to kick another man\\" is an accurate representation of the given scenario. This simplified statement still conveys the main action and the two people involved: one person attempting to kick, and another person being the target of the kick.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: steam train pulling through the countryside","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"steam train pulling through the countryside\\" are: 1. Steam train 2. Pulling 3. Countryside Here's a detailed explanation for each word: 1. Steam train: This phrase refers to a specific type of train that is powered by steam, which is an important detail in understanding the essence of the sentence. Steam trains have historical significance as they were used extensively in the 19th and early 20th centuries before giving way to diesel and electric locomotives. They represent the progress and growth of rail transportation during that period, and by including this word, the sentence conveys an image of a classic, vintage form of transportation and possibly a nostalgic experience for some. 2. Pulling: The action word \\"pulling\\" refers to the motion of the train, indicating that it is actively moving forward and transporting something, either passengers or cargo. Pulling is an essential aspect of a train's core purpose – to transport people and goods from one location to another. It is also significant to note that trains can only move in a linear path along the tracks, which restricts their range of motion compared to other land vehicles. The word \\"pulling\\" imparts a sense of the train's power and determination to overcome any obstacles while navigating through various landscapes. 3. Countryside: The term \\"countryside\\" provides the setting for the train's journey and adds depth to the imagery portrayed in the sentence. By specifying that the steam train is moving through the countryside, the sentence paints a picture of a peaceful, picturesque environment, perhaps filled with rolling hills, green fields, and quaint villages. This sets a particular mood and atmosphere, contrasting to the bustle and noise of a city or the barrenness of a desert. The juxtaposition of a steam train traveling through the countryside might also suggest a connection between the industrial revolution and rural communities or a romantic sense of adventure and exploration in a bygone era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Spanish side of the Strait is protected under El Estrecho Natural Park. - Almería is a city in Andalusia, Spain, situated in the southeast of Spain on the Mediterranean Sea. It is the capital of the province of the same name. It was Abd-ar-Rahman III who founded the Alcazaba (the Citadel), which gave this city its name: Al-Mari'yah (, the Watchtower). In the 10th and 11th centuries, it formed part of the Caliphate of Córdoba, and grew wealthy on trade and the textile industry, especially silk. It suffered many sieges and fell under Christian domination in 1489. In 1522, Almería was devastated by an earthquake and rebuilding and recovery didn't really get underway until the 19th century. During the Spanish Civil War, the city was shelled by the German Navy, and fell to Franco in 1939. It has since rebuilt its economy around vegetable production, with 100,000 acres of greenhouses, supplying much of Europe. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

Kevin Smith Opens His 'Secret Stash' in New AMC Series After many months of behind-the-scenes drama on its costly scripted drama series, AMC, the cable home of “Mad Men,” “Breaking Bad” and “The Walking Dead,” said on Thursday that it was moving forward on two new reality programs – shows that will presumably be easier on the channel’s pocketbook and won’t result in as many backstage headaches. The first show, “Secret Stash,” comes from Kevin Smith (who earned his geek-culture bona fides with his films “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy”) and is set in his Red Bank, N.J., comics shop, Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash. AMC said in a news release that the series would capture “the world of the neighborhood comic-book store and fanboy culture” and is planned for a first-quarter 2012 premiere. The ever-talkative Mr. Smith, who will be an executive producer of the show, said in a statement that he was “ecstatic, proud, and extremely lucky to be in bed with a network I watch religiously anyway,” adding: “If they’d pushed just a little harder in the negotiations, I’d have done this show for no payment beyond early access to every episode of ‘Mad Men,’ ‘Breaking Bad’ and ‘Walking Dead.’ ” The second show, “JJK Security,” chronicles a family-owned private security company in rural Georgia. AMC said the series was inspired “by what filmmakers like the Coen Brothers, Christopher Guest and Robert Altman have done capturing quirky, larger than life characters in the scripted realm,” and will make its debut in the third quarter of 2012.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

My new Pulsar RS200 seems to be getting too much heated up and the radiator fan starts after nearly 10 km of riding. Is it common? Why my new bike engine over heats at 12 km ride?","completion":"Although the two questions might appear similar at first glance as they both refer to an issue with a bike's engine overheating, there are subtle differences between them. Let's analyze each question and discuss their differences in terms of the specific motorcycles, distances, and focus areas they mention. Question 1: My new Pulsar RS200 seems to be getting too much heated up and the radiator fan starts after nearly 10 km of riding. Is it common? This question refers to a specific motorcycle model (Pulsar RS200) and seeks to understand if the described scenario (the radiator fan starting after nearly 10 km of riding) is common. The focus is on the heating and radiator fan operation, potentially implying that the user seeks to learn whether this phenomenon is typical for the Pulsar RS200 model and if there could be any underlying issues with the bike itself or the cooling system. Question 2: Why does my new bike engine overheat at 12 km ride? The second question does not mention a specific motorcycle model, and the distance at which the engine overheats is slightly different (12 km). This question's focus is more on determining the potential reasons and explanation as to why the engine overheats after this distance. While there is still the issue of engine overheating, the lack of context regarding the motorcycle model makes the inquiry broader and leaves room for a variety of responses that could vary based on the type of motorcycle. In summary, the two questions address the issue of motorcycle engines overheating, but they differ regarding the problem's presentation and the specific details provided: - Question 1 highlights a specific motorcycle model (Pulsar RS200) and is focused on the radiator fan's operation, seeking to understand if the described scenario is common for that particular model. - Question 2 does not provide information about the motorcycle model, making it a broader question that could apply to any motorcycle. The focus here is on identifying possible reasons for the engine's overheating after a 12 km ride. Due to these differences, it is crucial to provide a detailed and thoughtful answer that addresses each question's unique aspects, ensuring the information provided is relevant and accurate to the individual's concerns."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Crush Analysis Testimony Yergin was apparently planning to testify about estimated speeds of the F-250 and the Hyundai based on the amount of “crush” to the Hyundai. Although Yer-gin testified in front of the jury that there was probably a difference in speed between the two vehicles of 10 to 20 miles per hour, she never stated at any time what speeds she estimated the vehicles to be traveling. Nor did appellant’s counsel explain to the court what speeds Yergin concluded the vehicles were traveling.

This concept aligns with the idea in holding statement (E) where a general statement about introducing evidence of medical or mental impairment is insufficient, and more specific evidence is needed.

Summarize this article: When you relinquish your parental rights, you are giving up the right to direct the child's upbringing, including any decisions related to medical care, education, and religious upbringing. You also give up the responsibility to monitor your child's behavior or provide food, clothing, or shelter for your child. Once you give up parental rights, you are also giving up your right to have any contact with your child, including rights to visitation or telephone contact. Sometimes, you can negotiate an arrangement where you are allowed to contact the child, but these arrangements are highly unusual and hard to enforce. They often occur only where the state has moved to terminate the parental rights, not where a parent has voluntarily sought termination. Be aware that during the termination process, you will still be responsible for the child. This includes any child support payments due. In many states, you cannot relinquish your parental rights unless someone else is available to accept them. This will ensure that the child does not become a ward of the state. Typically, if one parent wants to give up parental rights then both parents must agree. Furthermore, there should be another person waiting in the wings to adopt the child, otherwise a court is unlikely to approve of termination even where the other parent agrees. You cannot give up your parental rights simply to get out of child support payments. A court does not terminate parental rights unless it is in the best interests of the child. Family law is complicated. Many different factors will impact your case and how a judge will view it. Accordingly, you should try to secure the services of an experienced local attorney to help you with the relinquishment process. You can find an experienced family law attorney by visiting your state's bar association website, which runs a referral program. If costs are a concern, be aware that many attorneys now offer “unbundled” legal services. With “unbundled” services, the attorney agrees only to do discrete tasks for a fee. You control what work the attorney performs. For example, you can have an attorney look at an adoption contract or represent you in court while you perform all other legal tasks yourself. Summary:","completion":"Relinquishing parental rights involves giving up the authority to direct a child's upbringing, including decisions on medical care, education, and religion, as well as the responsibility to monitor behaviour and provide basic needs. This also means giving up the right to any contact with the child. It is difficult to negotiate arrangements for contact after termination of parental rights, which often only occur when the state initiates the process. During termination, parents are still responsible, including paying child support. Generally, parental rights can only be relinquished if someone else is available to accept them, ensuring the child doesn't become a ward of the state. Both parents must agree for one to give up their rights, and a court must find it in the child's best interest. Family law can be complicated, so hiring an experienced local attorney is recommended, with options for \\"unbundled\\" services to manage costs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The explanation is simple, a five-year-old might think of it like this: If you don't like a toy anymore and you throw it away (which is like rejecting it), you would be happy (which is like it's encouraging). That's how it works with the statement about Pol Pot too. Rejecting is like throwing away and heartening is being happy about it. That's why \\"The fall of Pol Pot is encouraging\\" is just another way of saying \\"Rejection of Pol Pot is heartening.\\" Option 2) \\"it is not possible to tell,\\" is not correct because the meaning of the two sentences is pretty much the same. They both point to some positive feelings about negative events happening to Pol Pot. Option 3) \\"no,\\" is wrong because it contradicts the straightforward meaning of the two sentences which are essentially the same.

Pete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach. Maravich was survived by his wife Jackie and his two sons Jaeson, who was 8 years old, and Josh, aged 5. Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in Seattle, Washington, and introduced him to Michael Jordan. Since Maravich's children were very young when he died, Jackie Maravich initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father's funeral. However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait. During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told USA Today that, when he was still only a toddler, \\"My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I've been hooked ever since... . My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting. He said his dad told him he did the same thing.\\" Despite some setbacks coping with their father's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball--Josh at his father's alma mater, LSU. On June 27, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Assembly Center which already bears the basketball star's name. Former coach Dale Brown opposes such a monument, but Maravich's widow, Jackie McLachlan, said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of her husband. McLachlan said that she has noticed how fans struggle to get the Maravich name on the Assembly Center into a camera frame. In February 2016, the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a statue honoring Maravich be installed on the campus.

Last, \\"Turkey still has a long way to go\\" is translated as \\"Turcia are încă un drum lung de parcurs\\". Here, \\"a long way to go\\" is a phrase that translates as \\"un drum lung de parcurs\\", used metaphorically to mean that Turkey still has many issues to resolve.

Question: Article: The breaking news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday evening soon aroused public curiosity of the 57-year-old Chinese writer: Why was he favored by the Swedish Academy? Less than half an hour after the announcement from Stockholm, Mo's works turned to \\"sold out\\" status at China's major online book sellers. One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: \\"Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels.\\" Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation. Chinese media seemed to be shocked as some journalists were reported to be on their way overnight to Gaomi City of East China's Shandong Province, Mo's birthplace where he stayed with his family. Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages. For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances. \\"I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,\\" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists. Mo also said many folk arts originated from his hometown, such as paper cuts and traditional new year paintings, have inspired and influenced his novels. Mo's prize may give powerful encouragement to the country's writers as the more reflective of Chinese lives their works are, the more possible they arise as world literature.

What is the answer: The Chinese New Year has just occurred, what is it the year of?","completion":"To find the answer, I will follow these steps: 1. Determine the current year. 2. Identify the Chinese zodiac cycle. 3. Locate the current year within the zodiac cycle. Step 1: Determine the current year The current year is 2022. Step 2: Identify the Chinese zodiac cycle The Chinese zodiac is a repeating cycle of 12 years, with each year being represented by an animal sign. The 12 animal signs in order are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Step 3: Locate the current year within the zodiac cycle To determine which animal represents this year, I will find the year that is closest to 2022 and is evenly divisible by 12. The year 2020 is both evenly divisible by 12 (2020/12 = 168) and closest to 2022. Since the year 2020 was the year of the Rat (the first animal in the Chinese zodiac cycle), 2021 was the year of the Ox (the second animal in the cycle). Therefore, the Chinese New Year that has just occurred in 2022 marks the beginning of the Year of the Tiger, which is the third animal in the cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
