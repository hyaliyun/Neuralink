How is \\"Once again, I ask that the House kindly approves in its majority this amendment to the rules.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the given phrase \\"Once again, I ask that the House kindly approves in its majority this amendment to the rules\\" could be translated as: \\"Pyydän jälleen kerran, että Eduskunta ystävällisesti hyväksyy enemmistöllään tämän sääntöjen muutoksen.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"Once again\\" - In Finnish, this is translated as \\"jälleen kerran,\\" which literally means \\"again a time\\" or \\"one more time.\\" 2. \\"I ask\\" - The pronoun \\"I\\" can be translated into Finnish as \\"minä,\\" but most often Finns drop the pronoun in informal speech. In the phrase, \\"ask\\" is translated into \\"pyydän,\\" which is the first-person singular form of the verb \\"pyytää\\" (to ask). 3. \\"That\\" - In this context, the conjunction \\"that\\" is not directly translated into Finnish, instead, the sentence structure is adjusted accordingly. 4. \\"The House\\" - This refers to the Parliament or the \\"Eduskunta\\" in Finnish. 5. \\"Kindly\\" - This word translates to \\"ystävällisesti,\\" which is an adverb derived from the adjective \\"ystävällinen\\" meaning \\"friendly.\\" 6. \\"Approves\\" - The verb \\"to approve\\" translates into \\"hyväksyä\\" in Finnish. In this context, it becomes \\"hyväksyy,\\" which is the third person singular present form. 7. \\"In its majority\\" - The phrase translates into \\"enemmistöllään,\\" which is a combination of \\"enemmistö\\" (majority) and the possessive suffix \\"-lla\\" (it's or its). 8. \\"This\\" - This demonstrative, referring to the amendment, is translated as \\"tämän\\" ('this' in the genitive form, agreeing with \\"muutoksen\\"). 9. \\"Amendment to the rules\\" - The noun \\"amendment\\" is translated into Finnish as \\"muutos\\" or \\"muokkaus.\\" In this context, \\"muutos\\" is preferred as it implies a change in the rules. \\"Rules\\" in Finnish is \\"säännöt.\\" Therefore, the complete phrase is \\"tämän sääntöjen muutoksen\\" with \\"sääntöjen\\" being the plural genitive form (rules'). To summarize, the given phrase in Finnish would be: \\"Pyydän jälleen kerran, että Eduskunta ystävällisesti hyväksyy enemmistöllään tämän sääntöjen muutoksen.\\" While this translation may not be a word-for-word representation due to differences in Finnish and English grammar, it accurately conveys the full meaning of the original phrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I saw the student.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"I saw the student.\\" is linguistically acceptable in the English language. It is a concisely formed grammatically correct sentence. Let's break down the grammatical components: 1. Subject: \\"I\\" is the subject of the sentence. In English grammar, the subject refers to the person or thing that is doing an action or being described. In this case, \\"I\\" is the one doing the action. 2. Verb: \\"saw\\" is the verb, which is an action word. In this sentence, the action being depicted is seeing. \\"Saw\\" is the past simple tense of the verb \\"see,\\" indicating that the action took place in the past. 3. Object: \\"the student\\" is the object of the sentence. This is the person who is receiving the action or being acted upon. In this sentence, the student is the one being seen. 4. Article: \\"The\\" is used as a definite article in this sentence. An article is a type of adjective that's used to indicate whether the noun is specific or non-specific. \\"The\\" points forward to a specific item or items. Altogether, the sentence is a simple past tense sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, and a direct object. It correctly follows the basic English sentence structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Therefore, the sentence \\"I saw the student.\\" is linguistically acceptable. Furthermore, this sentence correctly conveys a complete thought or message, which is important for linguistic acceptability. A listener or reader can understand from this sentence that at some point in the past, the speaker saw someone who is a student. It leaves no ambiguities or doubts about what is intended to be communicated. If you want to add more information or details to this sentence, you have the opportunity to add adjectives, adverbs, or prepositional phrases. For example, \\"I quickly saw the diligent student in the library yesterday.\\" Even with these additional details, the sentence would remain linguistically acceptable as long as it follows the rules of grammar and syntax."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Above, we dealt with work problems in which the object is moving in the same direction as the force being applied to it. In reality, this isn't always the case. In cases where the force and the object's motion are in two different directions, the difference between these two directions must also be factored into the equation for an accurate result. To begin, find the magnitude of the force and the object's displacement as you normally would. Let's look at another example problem. In this case, let's say that we're pulling a toy train forward as in the example problem above, but that this time we're actually pulling upward at a diagonal angle. In the next step, we'll take this into account, but for now, we'll stick to the basics: the train's displacement and the magnitude of the force acting on it. For our purposes, let's say that the force has a magnitude of 10 newtons and that it's moved the same 2 meters (6.6 ft) forward as before. Unlike in the examples above, with a force that's in a different direction than the object's motion, it's necessary to find the difference between these two directions in the form of the angle between them. If this information isn't provided to you, you may need to measure it yourself or deduce it from other information in the problem. In our example problem, let's say that the force is being applied about 60o above the horizontal. If the train is still moving directly forward (that is, horizontally), the angle between the force vector and the train's motion is 60o. Once you know the object's displacement, the magnitude of the force acting on it, and the angle between the force vector and its motion, solving is almost as easy as it is without having to take the angle into account. Simply take the cosine of the angle (this may require a scientific calculator) and multiply it by force and displacement to find your answer in joules. Let's solve our example problem. Using a calculator, we find that the cosine of 60o is 1/2. Plugging this into the formula, we can solve as follows: 10 newtons × 2 meters (6.6 ft) × 1/2 = 10 joules. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary for this example would be: When an object is moved by a force in a different direction than it's moving, we need to find the angle between the force and the object's motion. In the example, a toy train is being pulled by a 10 Newton force at a 60-degree angle. To calculate the work done, we use the cosine of the angle and multiply it with the force and the object's displacement.

They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech (Donald Crisp). Rick and Pamela meet Beechâs 20-year-old granddaughter, Stella Meredith (Gail Russell), who lives with her grandfather in the nearby town of Biddlecombe. Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother died. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who has become infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the eerie sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn (Barbara Everest). The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Also, the strong scent of mimosa is that of her mother's favorite perfume.

Complete the next sentence: How to post while trotting on a horse Understand why posting is done. The main reason to post while riding is to avoid being jostled around in the saddle during a particularly bumpy gait-the trot. This makes things more comfortable for the rider and is easier on the horse's back.","completion":"Learn the proper technique for posting. 1. Start by finding a stable and well-fitted saddle, ensuring your safety and comfort while riding. Make sure the stirrups are adjusted to the correct length for your legs, allowing for slight bend in your knees while your feet rest flat in the stirrups. 2. Familiarize yourself with the horse's trotting movement. Observe the rhythm and pattern of the horse's strides, which typically involve two beats, as the diagonal pairs of legs move forward together. 3. Develop a good sitting position. Sitting tall and straight with your heels down, maintain a slight bend in your knees and elbows. Keep your core engaged to maintain balance, while staying relaxed and ready to move with the horse. 4. Begin posting by 'rising' during the upward motion of the horse's trot. As the horse's outside front leg moves forward, lift yourself slightly out of the saddle using your knees and thighs, while keeping your lower legs in contact with the horse's sides. Ensure that your seat moves slightly forward and upward, following the horse's natural movement. 5. Lower yourself back into the saddle after the upward phase, 'sitting' during the downward motion of the trot. This involves returning to your initial seated position, absorbing the impact gently through your knees and hips, and staying in sync with the horse's rhythm. 6. Practice the timing and coordination of the posting trot. Maintain a consistent rhythm as you rise and fall with the horse's movements, to ensure a smooth and comfortable ride for both you and the horse. 7. Refine your technique by keeping your upper body steady and maintaining soft contact with the horse's mouth through the reins. As you gain more confidence and experience, the posting trot will become more natural and intuitive, improving your overall riding skills and enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Remember that not all nematode species are a good food source, and some may even make your fish sick. If your local fish store sells live food, check for microworms there. Try getting in touch with other local hobbyists through aquarist clubs. A member there may cultivate microworms and may be willing to either give or sell you a starter. For a few dollars, you can also order microworms online. They are sold everywhere from large general auction sites to small hobbyist forums. If the species is listed, check to make sure that it belongs to the Panagrellus genus. Panagrellus redivivus is the most commonly found microworm. Remember that microworms are tiny white worms that are barely visible to the naked eye. A started culture of a large group of worms should like a gray or light brown clump. If your starter looks significantly different from this, you may have another type of worm that has been misidentified. Almost any container can be used, as long as it's deep enough for you to fit your index finger inside. Clear containers with resealable lids are the most convenient. Some popular options include yoghurt tubs, mason jars, and resealable plastic food containers. Any type of human food-grade starch is usable. Common sources of starch include oatmeal, wheat flour, bread, cornmeal, mashed potatoes, and cereal. If you're using a sealable container, be sure to poke small slits in the lid with a knife. Air exchange is necessary for a microworm colony to thrive. If your container doesn't have its own lid, cover the top up with tin foil. Microworms don't actually eat the starch. Instead, they eat microscopic yeast that feed on carbohydrates. You can find conveniently packaged dry yeast in the baking section of most supermarkets. Some stores also sell fresh compressed yeast that must be refrigerated. If you bake bread or brew beer at home, you can also use the same yeast to culture microworms.","completion":"To begin cultivating microworms as a food source for your fish, first acquire some live adult microworms, as they do not lay eggs.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater? The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Curtis Hesler On Commodities Just when we thought there was light at the end of the tunnel, we find it attached to the front of a locomotive. The big surprise next year will be the second and more devastating leg of the recession that started in 2007. Twisted statistics and media hoopla will no longer be able to cover up the fact that real unemployment continues to rise and that small businesses, which account for 70% or more of the jobs in our economy, are failing. Small firms are dehydrating under the onus of higher taxes and government-mandated worker benefits, higher operating costs and constantly eroding consumer demand. The Fed's insistence on promoting a long-term policy of near-zero interest rates has magnetically attracted the carry traders. These folks, often foreign, borrow dollars at artificially low rates and invest the money in higher paying investments. Greed rules, however, and carry traders tend to chase whatever is hot at the moment--currently, gold and the U.S. stock market. The mistake being made by the investment community is believing that the dollar will continue to fall indefinitely without an upside correction, if only to adjust technical imbalances. As the dollar corrects on the up side, the carry trades will unwind their positions. The result will be that investments in gold and the stock market will be sold, dollars bought, and the loans paid off. The consequence, considering that the economy is weaker than twisted statistics reveal and that we are entering period of escalating adjustments in adjusted rate mortgages next year, will be a return to the bear market of 2007-08. The dollar's rally will coincide with a correction in gold back to the 1,000 level where it will offer investors a splendid opportunity to buy either the metal or mining shares. If you are of a mind to pick up a decent gold stock, I suggest the core of your gold portfolio be in Goldcorp ( GG - news - people ). This is likely the very best gold miner on the planet. I have my sights set on accumulating Goldcorp at 34.50 or better during the next correction. Although the dollar rally may last for several months, it will be temporary. Since turning bullish on gold in 1999, I have espoused that the U.S. Dollar Index, now about 76, would fall to at least 60. At this point, that long-term forecast looks woefully short of the mark. Factoring in the events that have developed over the last few years, a better long term target for the U.S. Dollar Index is 40.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Write a summary based on this article: A group of Conservative Party supporters arrive with a portrait outside the home of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her death was announced in London April 8, 2013. LONDON (Reuters) - Controversial in life, British ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher continued to divide the nation in death, with somber plans for a funeral and eulogies rejected by some in favor of celebrations and parties. As Britain buzzed with the news on Monday afternoon that the \\"Iron Lady\\" had died, not everyone was in mourning. In Brixton, south London - the scene of fierce rioting in the 1980s, blamed on deep social divisions as well as racial tensions - a hastily convened party was gathering pace. \\"Thatcher herself, she represents so much of what people hate about what has happened to Britain in the last 20, 30 years,\\" said 40-year-old graphic designer Ben Windsor, standing next to a man holding a poster with a crude Thatcher cartoon and the words 'rejoice rejoice'. As policeman watched on, others arrived clutching cans of lager and bottles of wine and shouting 'she's dead!' By early evening, a quickly rising 199,000 people had \\"liked\\" the isthatcherdeadyet.co.uk website, which had been updated with a large block-capital \\"Yes.\\" The site encouraged visitors to party and provided a soundtrack. \\"Margaret Thatcher's dead. This lady's not returning,\\" said the site. The phrase is a play on words of Thatcher's famous remark 'The lady's not for turning', which she said in a speech in 1980 at a political conference to those in her own Conservative party who were urging her to moderate her radical, right-wing polices. Those policies, credited by some with modernizing Britain, alienated many, who saw her as a destroyer of jobs and traditional industries. The vitriolic words being hurled 23 years since she stepped down as prime minister showed that many had not forgiven and forgotten. \\"Best news I have had all year,\\" said one commentator on social website Facebook, who said he was a former miner. A bottle of milk was placed on the doorstep of Thatcher's home in Belgravia, a reference to her policy of scrapping free milk for primary school children while head of education in the 1970s, a move which earned her the moniker \\"Thatcher the milk snatcher.\\" A Twitter feed with the hashtag #nowthatchersdead attracted a swift stream of dubious jokes, celebrations and recriminations, as well as some confused fans of the U.S. singer and actress Cher who had misread the tag. Trade unionists tweeted that they were heading to the pub, while others said they were chilling champagne and asked \\"where the party\\" was. Fliers have appeared around in London in recent days declaring that there would be a party in Trafalgar Square, a traditional center for celebrations and protests in the capital, on the Saturday following her death. An attempt to get Ella Fitzgerald's version of 'The Witch is Dead' to chart was the subject of another Facebook campaign on Monday. Another anti-tribute features in popular musical Billy Elliot, set during the 1980s mining strike. The song contains the words 'Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher, we all celebrate today 'cos it's one day closer to your death'. The musical is currently running in London. \\"She wanted to crush the trade unions, the working class movement; she didn't finish us off but that was what her aim was,\\" said Judith Orr, the editor of left-wing newspaper Socialist Worker. \\"I'm glad to see the back of her.\\" (Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien, Sarah Young and Paul Sandle; Editing by Peter Graff and Jon Hemming) ||||| Thatcher, Through Bold British Headlines: In Westminster, Londoners remember Margaret Thatcher while picking up their favorite newspapers, each splashed with their own take on the former prime minister. LONDON — With broadcasters, columnists and editorialists absorbed in chronicling Margaret Thatcher’s life, times and demise, Britons on Tuesday mulled the ideological divide that her critics and even some of her admirers depicted as deepening during her years as prime minister. While many current and former politicians seemed to form lines to offer their reaction to her death of a stroke at age 87 on Monday, and radio shows were filled with recordings of her best-known utterances, some isolated protests broke out overnight in London, Bristol and Glasgow, reflecting the same social schism between haves and have-nots that characterized the debate over her legacy. Hundreds of her opponents gathered at the site of violent protests against her policies in the 1980s, with a small crowd in Brixton, in south London — where anti-Thatcher riots broke out in 1981 — chanting “Maggie, Maggie, Maggie — Dead, Dead, Dead.” The protest recalled the early days of the Thatcher era, when joblessness soared as faltering industries were denied subsidies and a record 10,000 businesses went bankrupt. “Things will get worse before they get better,” she said at the time, depicting the economic malaise as a legacy of left-wing rule. With riots in Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol as well as Brixton, Mrs. Thatcher later recalled 1981 as the worst of her 11 years in office. At what was billed as a celebratory street party in the southwestern city of Bristol overnight, around 200 people clashed with police officers trying to disperse them early on Tuesday, the police said, and six officers were injured in scuffles. One officer remained in the hospital on Tuesday and one partygoer was arrested on a charge of violent disorder. “We can’t deny that Lady Thatcher divided opinion,” Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday. But some who castigated her as divisive also paid grudging respect to her stature. On Tuesday, her admirers depicted her policies, like encouraging private business and crushing labor unions, as liberating the economy from years in the doldrums, while her foes characterized them as ruinous for the poor. Many critics also remembered what was widely seen as a catastrophic political misjudgment toward the end of her third and final term as Britain’s longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century when she sought to impose a so-called community charge, which was widely known as the poll tax, provoking mass public protests. “Margaret Thatcher broke Britain and replaced what had come before with something crueller, nastier,” the left-wing Daily Mirror said in an editorial. In the northern city of Sheffield, which blamed her for the loss of jobs, a headline in The Star, a regional newspaper, said, “We can never forgive her.” Several radio shows were devoted to Mrs. Thatcher’s record in crushing organized labor after confrontations with miners and printers, among others. But others recalled more popular measures — like selling public housing to private buyers at reduced prices — that extended private ownership to citizens along with opportunities for small investors to buy stakes in privatized state industries. The liberal-leaning Guardian said in an editorial: “There should be no dancing on her grave but it is right there is no state funeral either. Her legacy is of public division, private selfishness and a cult of greed, which together shackle far more of the human spirit than they ever set free.” By contrast, conservative newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail offered enthusiastic praise for what The Mail, in an online commentary echoing Mr. Cameron, called “the woman who saved Britain” and “a giant beside whom other peacetime politicians of the 20th and 21st centuries look like mere pygmies.” On Monday, Mr. Cameron said Parliament would be recalled from a recess to assemble on Wednesday so that lawmakers can offer their views in advance of a ceremonial funeral with military honors next week, during which Mrs. Thatcher’s body will be brought to St. Paul’s Cathedral on a gun carriage — the traditional cortege for royalty and leaders of stature, including Winston Churchill. Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday that Queen Elizabeth II would join hundreds of dignitaries at the service on April 17 — the first time she has attended the funeral of a former prime minister since Churchill’s death in 1965. As is the practice between the monarch and serving prime ministers, the queen and Mrs. Thatcher met for private conversations at weekly audiences. But a biography of Queen Elizabeth by Ben Pimlott said their relationship displayed “a rigidity that never softened.” Her body will not lie in state and the ceremony will not be a state funeral, according to the British authorities. But it will be conducted with the trappings of a historic moment with streets cordoned off and military honor guards. The funeral will be conducted with the same level of pomp and formality as those of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, and the Queen Mother in 2002, British authorities have said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A long time ago, Margaret Thatcher, who was the leader of Britain, passed away.

Q: We present Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm which extends beam search to allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The algorithm can be used with any model that generates a sequence ŷ = {y0 . . . yT }, by maximizing p(y|x) = ∏ t p(yt|x; {y0 . . . yt−1}). Lexical constraints take the form of phrases or words that must be present in the output sequence. This is a very general way to incorporate additional knowledge into a model’s output without requiring any modification of the model parameters or training data. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of Lexically Constrained Decoding by conducting experiments on Neural Interactive-Predictive Translation, as well as Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation. Experiments show that GBS can provide large improvements in translation quality in interactive scenarios, and that, even without any user input, GBS can be used to achieve significant gains in performance in domain adaptation scenarios.

(D). change form when pressure is applied.","completion":"The task here is to choose the correct option that describes how rocks should be classified as igneous. Step 1: Understand the nature of igneous rocks: Igneous rocks are rocks formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This can happen both at the Earth's surface and beneath it, which leads us to the term intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks but overall, they are formed from magma. Step 2: Evaluate each option: (A) solidify at the surface of Earth: This option partially describes a subset of igneous rocks (extrusive igneous rocks), but not all of them, so it is not fully correct. (B) be eroded and deposited in layers: This is related more to the formation of sedimentary rocks, not igneous rocks. Hence this option is incorrect. (C) be formed from magma: This is the primary manner in which igneous rocks are formed, thus this option is correct. (D) change form when pressure is applied: This implies the formation of metamorphic rocks, not igneous rocks. Hence this option is incorrect. Step 3: Pick the correct choice based on the evaluation. Therefore, the correct choice is (C) be formed from magma. Because the foundational criterion that classifies a rock as igneous is its formation from magma or lava. This principle applies to all igneous rocks irrespective of where they solidify (surface or beneath the Earth)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless -- one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminium cans and sells them for five cents a piece.At night, he sleeps on the street. \\"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he's had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine.But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement.He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York city rose more than 27 percent between 1984 and 1999, from US 549 to US 700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies have been built for the poor.Many small apartments in the city now rent for US 1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house. Smiling, he said he also has seven grandchildren whom he'd like to see more often. \\"All I've got to do is clean up my act,\\" he said.

It's important to clarify the distinction between galaxies and solar systems. A solar system consists of a star (or a system of stars) and various celestial objects, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, that are gravitationally bound to it. Our solar system, for example, includes the Sun and all the celestial bodies orbiting it, like the Earth, Venus, Mars, and other planets. A galaxy, on the other hand, is a vast system composed of millions or billions of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. It is held together by gravitational forces and can span hundreds of thousands of light-years in diameter. There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. Now, regarding the sentence in question, The Milky Way is, in fact, the name of a galaxy. However, it is not a galaxy \\"in\\" our solar system. Our solar system is just a part of the Milky Way galaxy, so it would be more accurate to say our solar system is within the Milky Way galaxy. The text provided, which mentions the Milky Way, high-velocity clouds, and gas accretion, discusses phenomena happening within the larger context of the Milky Way galaxy. This information supports the fact that the Milky Way is a galaxy, but it doesn't directly address the relationship between the solar system and the Milky Way.

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the basin next to the warehouse located at the point which the Ashton Canal, Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet? from the following article ? After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the Portland Basin warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the people who died at the palace?, using the article: Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace..., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times On the morning of Nov. 20 last year, Tyrone Tomlin sat in the cage of one of the Brooklyn criminal courthouse’s interview rooms, a bare white cinder-block cell about the size of an office cubicle. Hardly visible through the heavy steel screen in front of him was Alison Stocking, the public defender who had just been assigned to his case. Tomlin, exhausted and frustrated, was trying to explain how he came to be arrested the afternoon before. It wasn’t entirely clear to Tomlin himself. Still in his work clothes, his boots encrusted with concrete dust, he recounted what had happened. The previous afternoon, he was heading home from a construction job. Tomlin had served two short stints in prison on felony convictions for auto theft and selling drugs in the late ’80s and mid-’90s, but even now, grizzled with white stubble and looking older than his 53 years, he found it hard to land steady work and relied on temporary construction gigs to get by. Around the corner from his home in Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tomlin has lived his entire life, he ran into some friends near the corner of Schenectady and Lincoln Avenues outside the FM Brothers Discount store, its stock of buckets, mops, backpacks and toilet paper overflowing onto the sidewalk. As he and his friends caught up, two plainclothes officers from the New York Police Department’s Brooklyn North narcotics squad, recognizable by the badges on their belts and their bulletproof vests, paused outside the store. At the time, Tomlin thought nothing of it. ‘‘I’m not doing anything wrong,’’ he remembers thinking. ‘‘We’re just talking.’’ Tomlin broke off to go inside the store and buy a soda. The clerk wrapped it in a paper bag and handed him a straw. Back outside, as the conversation wound down, one of the officers called the men over. He asked one of Tomlin’s friends if he was carrying anything he shouldn’t; he frisked him. Then he turned to Tomlin, who was holding his bagged soda and straw. ‘‘He thought it was a beer,’’ Tomlin guesses. ‘‘He opens the bag up, it was a soda. He says, ‘What you got in the other hand?’ I says, ‘I got a straw that I’m about to use for the soda.’ ’’ The officer asked Tomlin if he had anything on him that he shouldn’t. ‘‘I says, ‘No, you can check me, I don’t have nothing on me.’ He checks me. He’s going all through my socks and everything.’’ The next thing Tomlin knew, he says, he was getting handcuffed. ‘‘I said, ‘Officer, what am I getting locked up for?’ He says, ‘Drug paraphernalia.’ I says, ‘Drug paraphernalia?’ He opens up his hand and shows me the straw.’’ Stocking, an attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, a public-defense office that represents 45,000 indigent clients a year, had picked up Tomlin’s case file a few minutes before interviewing him. The folder was fat, always a bad sign to a public defender. The documentation submitted by the arresting officer explained that his training and experience told him that plastic straws are ‘‘a commonly used method of packaging heroin residue.’’ The rest of the file contained Tomlin’s criminal history, which included 41 convictions, all of them, save the two decades-old felonies, for low-level nonviolent misdemeanors — crimes of poverty like shoplifting food from the corner store. With a record like that, Stocking told her client, the district attorney’s office would most likely ask the judge to set bail, and there was a good chance that the judge would do it. If Tomlin couldn’t come up with the money, he’d go to jail until his case was resolved. Their conversation didn’t last long. On average, a couple of hundred cases pass through Brooklyn’s arraignment courtrooms every day, and the public defenders who handle the overwhelming majority of those cases rarely get to spend more than 10 minutes with each client before the defendant is called into court for arraignment. Before leaving, Stocking relayed what the assistant district attorney told her a few minutes earlier: The prosecution was prepared to offer Tomlin a deal. Plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, serve 30 days on Rikers and be done with it. Tomlin said he wasn’t interested. A guilty plea would only add to his record and compound the penalties if he were arrested again. ‘‘They’re mistaken,’’ he told Stocking. ‘‘It’s a regular straw!’’ When the straw was tested by the police evidence lab, he assured her, it would show that he was telling the truth. In the meantime, there was no way he was pleading guilty to anything. When it was Tomlin’s turn in front of the judge, events unfolded as predicted: The assistant district attorney handling the case offered him 30 days for a guilty plea. After he refused, the A.D.A. asked for bail. The judge agreed, setting it at 1,500. Tomlin, living paycheck to paycheck, had nothing like that kind of money. ‘‘If it had been 100, I might have been able to get that,’’ he said afterward. As it was, less than 24 hours after getting off work, Tomlin was on a bus to Rikers Island, New York’s notorious jail complex, where his situation was about to get a lot worse. ‘‘Criminal justice,’’ President Obama said in a speech to the N.A.A.C.P. last month, ‘‘is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it.’’ Two days after the speech, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, meeting with convicts in a corrections institution in El Reno, Okla. The setting was dramatic, but mass incarceration isn’t actually a federal problem. Of the 2.2 million people currently locked up in this country, fewer than one in 10 is being held in a federal prison. Far more are serving time in state prisons, and nearly three-quarters of a million aren’t in prison at all but in local city and county jails. Of those in jails, 60 percent haven’t been convicted of anything. They’re innocent in the eyes of the law, awaiting resolution in their cases. Some of these inmates are being held because they’re considered dangerous or unlikely to return to court for their hearings. But many of them simply cannot afford to pay the bail that has been set. Occasionally, these cases make the news. In June, Sandra Bland was found dead in her cell in Texas after failing to come up with 500 for her release. But often, they go unnoticed. The federal government doesn’t track the number of people locked up because they can’t make bail. What we do know is that at any given time, close to 450,000 people are in pretrial detention in the United States — a figure that includes both those denied bail and those unable to pay the bail that has been set. Even that figure fails to capture the churn of local incarceration: In a given year, city and county jails across the country admit between 11 million and 13 million people. In New York City, where courts use bail far less than in many jurisdictions, roughly 45,000 people are jailed each year simply because they can’t pay their court-assigned bail. And while the city’s courts set bail much lower than the national average, only one in 10 defendants is able to pay it at arraignment. To put a finer point on it: Even when bail is set comparatively low — at 500 or less, as it is in one-third of nonfelony cases — only 15 percent of defendants are able to come up with the money to avoid jail. Bail hasn’t always been a mechanism for locking people up. When the concept first took shape in England during the Middle Ages, it was emancipatory. Rather than detaining people indefinitely without trial, magistrates were required to let defendants go free before seeing a judge, guaranteeing their return to court with a bond. If the defendant failed to return, he would forfeit the amount of the bond. The bond might be secured — that is, with some or all of the amount of the bond paid in advance and returned at the end of the trial — or it might not. In 1689, the English Bill of Rights outlawed the widespread practice of keeping defendants in jail by setting deliberately unaffordable bail, declaring that ‘‘excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed.’’ The same language was adopted word for word a century later in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. But as bail has evolved in America, it has become less and less a tool for keeping people out of jail, and more and more a trap door for those who cannot afford to pay it. Unsecured bond has become vanishingly rare, and in most jurisdictions, there are only two ways to make bail: post the entire amount yourself up front — what’s called ‘‘money bail’’ or ‘‘cash bail’’ — or pay a commercial bail bondsman to do so. For relatively low bail amounts — say, below 2,000, the range in which most New York City bails fall — the second option often doesn’t even exist; bondsmen can’t make enough money from such small bails to make it worth their while. With national attention suddenly focused on the criminal-justice system, bail has been cited as an easy target for reformers. But ensuring that no one is held in jail based on poverty would, in many respects, necessitate a complete reordering of criminal justice. The open secret is that in most jurisdictions, bail is the grease that keeps the gears of the overburdened system turning. Faced with the prospect of going to jail for want of bail, many defendants accept plea deals instead, sometimes at their arraignments. New York City courts processed 365,000 arraignments in 2013; well under 5 percent of those cases went all the way to a trial resolution. If even a small fraction of those defendants asserted their right to a trial, criminal courts would be overwhelmed. By encouraging poor defendants to plead guilty, bail keeps the system afloat. ‘‘What, did they arrest all of Brooklyn today?’’ one court officer asked another on a recent Sunday night in one of the two bustling arraignment courtrooms in Downtown Brooklyn. Defendants, a vast majority of them black, paraded past the judge in quick succession: Unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Open container of alcohol in public. Marijuana possession. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. Misdemeanors, many of them minor, some aggravated by an outstanding bench warrant for failure to appear in court on another case, failure to complete court-ordered community service or failure to pay a fine. Hundreds of people were awaiting arraignment, first in central booking across the street, then in cells on the ninth floor and finally in a small communal cell called ‘‘the pen’’ behind the arraignment courtrooms on the ground floor. On this night, there were more than a dozen men in the cell waiting to see a lawyer, pacing, sitting on benches, crouching in corners. One man called out from the pen, saying that there was dried excrement in there from the day before. ‘‘Nobody comes in here to clean!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘It’s mad dirty!’’ A guard approached the bars and briefly sprayed a can of air freshener. Around the corner, the pen opened onto a series of booths, where, separated by heavy metal screens, the defendants met with their lawyers. Scott Hechinger, a senior trial attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, picked up a stack of case files, quickly scanned the charges and rap sheets, stepped down a short hallway behind the courtroom and started calling names through the mesh screen. The first client was charged with criminal mischief after getting in an argument with his girlfriend and breaking some bowls. It was more complicated than that, he told Hechinger. She came home drunk, threw his clothes out the window. It escalated. He left. They arrested him across the street. Hechinger called the girlfriend and left a message. He called the client’s mother, whom the man lived with. If bail was set, how much could she afford? At most 250. Time’s up. Next case. A young man jumped a subway turnstile. Prosecutors were offering to make it go away and let him out that night if he did two days of community service and avoided being rearrested for the next six months. This one was easy. ‘‘Take the deal,’’ Hechinger said. It was better than paying a 120 fee. Next up was a homeless teenager, charged with ‘‘obstruction of governmental administration.’’ The paperwork said the police saw him with a knife, and that he resisted arrest. He said there was no knife, that the cops stopped him for no reason and beat him. He showed Hechinger bruises on his arms and a fat lip. It was hard to see much through the screen. Hechinger promised to take a closer look in a few minutes when they were in front of the judge together. The final person was a man arrested for driving with a suspended license, a straightforward case. After less than half an hour, Hechinger was back in the courtroom. The defendants he interviewed were marched out onto a bench against the left wall. First was the turnstile jumper. The prosecutor laid out the charges and the offer. The defendant took the deal and would have to complete community service. Next was the homeless teenager. The prosecutor asked for bail of 5,000. Hechinger argued that bail was unnecessary. The judge set it at 250. The teenager didn’t have it. He would be sleeping at Rikers. The guy with the suspended license was released on his own recognizance — without any bail — and would be due back in court in a couple of months. Next appeared the man who broke his girlfriend’s bowls. The prosecutor wanted bail set at 2,500. Hechinger argued that there was no reason to believe his client wouldn’t return to court on his own. The judge set it at 1,000. ‘‘Your honor, I called the mother, she said she could afford 250,’’ Hechinger said. ‘‘I’m sorry, counselor, that’s my bail decision,’’ the judge responded. Another half-hour had elapsed. Hechinger went back to the case pile and picked up another stack. One of the three other defenders working the courtroom stepped up with her own cases. When court shut down for the night at 1 a.m., defendants were still waiting. They would stay in their cells and be arraigned when court started up again in the morning. The sheer speed of the arraignment process makes it virtually impossible for the court to make informed decisions. Prosecutors have nothing to go on but a statement from the police and possibly a complaining witness, and defense lawyers know only what they’ve been able to glean from their brief interviews and perhaps a phone call or two. It’s in this hurried moment, at the very outset of a criminal case, before evidence has been weighed or even gathered, that a defendant’s freedom is decided. The stakes are high, and not only for the obvious reason that jail is an unpleasant and often dangerous place to be. A pretrial stretch in jail can unravel the lives of vulnerable defendants in significant ways. The next hearing in Tyrone Tomlin’s drinking-straw case was scheduled for a week after his arraignment. He left the courthouse, was loaded onto a bus and crossed the narrow causeway that connects Queens to Rikers. Tomlin was assigned to the Anna M. Kross Center, one of 10 correctional facilities on the island. Incarcerated people rarely have nice things to say about the places where they’re locked up, but an investigation by the United States attorney’s office this year found ‘‘a deep-seated culture of violence’’ among Rikers guards, who reported using force against inmates more than 4,000 times last year. Violence among inmates is also pervasive. A Department of Corrections document obtained by The Daily News reported 108 stabbings and slashings in the last year. ‘‘That place is miserable,’’ Tomlin said. ‘‘It’s dangerous. It’s every man for himself. You could get abused, you could get raped, you could get extorted. That stuff is all around.’’ Housed in a unit with more than 50 other prisoners, Tomlin tried to keep his head down, and he was able to get through a week without incident. Outside, his aunt worried about him. His employer had no idea where he was. On Nov. 25, he was back in court for a discovery hearing, during which prosecutors were supposed to turn over any relevant evidence. None was presented, but prosecutors repeated their offer for Tomlin to plead guilty. He still refused. ‘‘I wasn’t taking nothing, because I didn’t do nothing,’’ he says. His case was adjourned for another two weeks. Tomlin’s willingness to hold out against the charges was unusual. Across the criminal-justice system, bail acts as a tool of compulsion, forcing people who would not otherwise plead guilty to do so. A 2012 report by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, based on 10 years’ worth of criminal statistics, bears this out. In nonfelony cases in which defendants were not detained before their trials, either because no bail was set or because they were able to pay it, only half were eventually convicted. When defendants were locked up until their cases were resolved, the conviction rate jumped to 92 percent. This isn’t just anecdotal; a multivariate analysis found that even controlling for other factors, pretrial detention was the single greatest predictor of conviction. ‘‘The data suggest that detention itself creates enough pressure to increase guilty pleas,’’ the report concluded. Still awaiting a trial, Tomlin returned to Rikers and quickly got into trouble with a group of younger inmates while on the phone with his aunt. ‘‘A young guy tells me, ‘Yo, pop, you gotta get off the phone,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘I said, ‘I’m in the middle of an important call.’ He wanted me to just hang up.’’ Tomlin quickly realized he’d made a mistake. That evening, in the shower, he was jumped by a group of young men. ‘‘Most of the punches went to the side of my head and my eye,’’ he said. ‘‘I was tussling one and had to worry about the other three, there was blows coming from everywhere.’’ Punched, kicked and stomped, Tomlin received medical attention, his face monstrously misshapen, his left eye swollen shut. ‘‘You’d think I was Frankenstein’s brother or something,’’ he said. Tomlin’s eye was still swollen shut on Dec. 10, three weeks after his arrest, when he returned to court. At this hearing, prosecutors handed over a report from the police laboratory, which had tested the drinking straw. At the top of the report, in bold, underlined capital letters, were the words ‘‘No Controlled Substance Identified, Notify District Attorney.’’ The report had been faxed to the district attorney on Nov. 25, the same day as Tomlin’s last court hearing and days before his beating. The key to his freedom had been sitting unexamined. Conceding that the case had unraveled, the prosecutor asked that the charges be dismissed. ‘‘The judge says, ‘Mr. Tomlin, this is your lucky day, you’re going home,’ ’’ Tomlin recalls. ‘‘I just left the courtroom, signed some papers and that was it.’’ Tomlin had lost three weeks of income, was subjected to brutal physical violence and missed Thanksgiving dinner with his family. But he resisted the pressure to plead guilty. His previous convictions all came from pleas, most of them made with bail looming over him. He knows the bitter Catch-22 of pleading guilty to get out of jail. ‘‘It feels great to go home,’’ he says. ‘‘Anybody’s happy to go home. But at the same time, it feels bad, because that’s more damage on your record.’’ For defendants who would fight their cases and maintain their innocence if they had the money, a guilty plea involves a ritual of court procedure that verges on the Kafkaesque: ‘‘Your lawyer tells me you want to plead guilty to the charge. Is that correct?’’ the judge will ask. Yes, the defendant must reply. ‘‘You understand that by your plea of guilty you are giving up certain trial rights?’’ Yes. ‘‘The right to remain silent, the right to confront witnesses against you, the right to have the prosecutor prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?’’ Yes, yes, yes. And then: ‘‘Are you pleading guilty freely and voluntarily, because you are in fact guilty?’’ Hechinger, the lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services, hates this part of the process. ‘‘A lot of times, at that last question, you feel the client beside you bristle,’’ he says. ‘‘Everyone in the room knows it’s not ‘freely and voluntarily.’ They’re making a decision coerced by money. In many cases, if they had money, they wouldn’t be pleading. But they put their heads down, and they say, ‘Yes.’ It’s a horrible, deflating feeling.’’ The long-term damage that bail inflicts on vulnerable defendants extends well beyond incarceration. Disappearing into the machinery of the justice system separates family members, interrupts work and jeopardizes housing. ‘‘Most of our clients are people who have crawled their way up from poverty or are in the throes of poverty,’’ Hechinger says. ‘‘Our clients work in service-level positions where if you’re gone for a day, you lose your job. People in need of caretaking — the elderly, the young — are left without caretakers. People who live in shelters, where if they miss their curfews, they lose their housing. Folks with immigration concerns are quicker to be put on the immigration radar. So when our clients have bail set, they suffer on the inside, they worry about what’s happening on the outside, and when they get out, they come back to a world that’s more difficult than the already difficult situation that they were in before.’’ This spring, a 24-year-old woman named Adriana found herself newly single in New York, trying to make a life for herself and her daughter. Short and round, with oversize glasses that frequently slide off her nose, she has an easy manner and deadpan sense of humor that belie her past as a runaway from an abusive mother. Adriana arrived in New York in the middle of 2014 with her baby daughter, not yet 2, and knew no one but her boyfriend at the time, a controlling figure who lived off her earnings from massages she advertised on Craigslist. (Like many runaways, Adriana had sometimes relied on sex work to survive, though recently she was trying to avoid it.) After separating from her boyfriend, Adriana managed to secure a spot in a Brooklyn shelter for victims of domestic violence. ‘‘I was trying to get a job, trying to get my life together,’’ she says. She was focused on her daughter. ‘‘I just want to be the best mother for her that I can be,’’ she says. ‘‘That’s my priority. That’s my only priority.’’ (Because of safety concerns, Adriana asked not to be identified by her full name.) On the night of March 18, Adriana realized she was running low on diapers. A friend at the shelter who also had a child agreed to keep an eye on her daughter, and Adriana headed to a nearby Target. This was after curfew, and when a staff member saw Adriana leaving without her daughter, she called the police. ‘‘When I got to Target, I started getting all these texts from my friend,’’ Adriana says. ‘‘She was saying, ‘You’ve got to get back here — there are staff in your room, and they won’t let me in to look after the baby.’ ’’ Adriana rushed home with the diapers. In the shelter’s courtyard, she was met by police officers, who had her daughter. ‘‘Where are you going with my baby?’’ she asked, according to court documents. ‘‘That’s my baby. I just went to the store to buy diapers.’’ It didn’t matter. The police placed her under arrest, charging her with endangering the welfare of a child. She gave one of the officers the diapers she’d just bought, in case her daughter needed to be changed. She was handcuffed and taken to the precinct. The police took her daughter to the station, too, where she was turned over to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services and eventually placed in a foster home. Before her arraignment two days later, Adriana explained to her public defender what happened. Her friend could confirm that she was looking after the baby, she said. The lawyer told Adriana she’d do her best to get her released on her own recognizance. But when Adriana appeared in front of Judge Rosemarie Montalbano, the assistant district attorney asked for bail to be set at 5,000. Adriana had no criminal record and had never failed to make a court appearance, but the prosecutor cited an ‘‘A.C.S. history,’’ meaning that Adriana and her daughter had previous contact with the Administration for Children’s Services. This was true but misleading. The A.C.S. report involving Adriana had found that she wasn’t responsible for any neglect or abuse. What the A.C.S. did find was violence and coercion on the part of her boyfriend; this is how Adriana landed a spot in the domestic-violence shelter. But arraignments happen quickly. Just as there was no time to track down Adriana’s friend to confirm that her daughter hadn’t been left unsupervised, there was no time to find out what the A.C.S. order actually said. The judge set bail at 1,500. Adriana’s public defender couldn’t believe it. ‘‘Judge, I’m going to ask you to state the reason for setting bail in this case,’’ she said, according to the court transcript. ‘‘Thank you, counsel,’’ was the judge’s only reply. With no way to come up with 1,500, Adriana spent the next two weeks on Rikers Island. Her bail made it harder for her to fight her case, but it also effectively dismantled the new life she was trying to build for herself and her daughter. She lost her bed at the shelter, and her child was living with strangers. ‘‘It feels like they were kicking me when I was down,’’ she says. Over subsequent hearings, Adriana’s lawyers tried to get her bail lifted, but they ran into another common problem facing defendants: Once a judge sets bail, other judges are often reluctant to second-guess their colleague’s decision. If they free a defendant who commits a crime while out on bail, the blowback from politicians, police unions and the tabloid press can be substantial. ‘‘I have no idea what motivated Judge Montalbano to set bail,’’ said Judge Andrew Borrok at one of Adriana’s hearings, four days after her arraignment. Still, he said, ‘‘I’m not inclined to change what’s been done.’’ Adriana’s lawyers managed to move her case to a court that specialized in sex-trafficking cases, hoping for a more sympathetic judge and prosecutors. In the trafficking court, however, prosecutors remained reluctant to lift bail, now citing concerns that Adriana’s safety could be at risk if her ex-boyfriend found out she was set free. Ultimately, after two weeks of hearings, prosecutors agreed to remove Adriana’s bail provided she complete weekly ‘‘life-skills coursework’’ administered by a group that serves arrested sex workers. ‘‘Congratulations on being in a place where a lot of people care about you,’’ Adriana remembers the judge telling her as she stood before him in handcuffs, quietly asking a court officer to push her glasses back up her nose. ‘‘There’s a lot of people in this room that want good things to happen to you. The fear is that you’re not ready for all of these great things.’’ The judge ordered Adriana released. She could begin reassembling her life, finding a new shelter, retrieving whatever remained of her possessions. But her baby was still in foster care, and her case still wasn’t resolved. In June, a judge finally agreed to dismiss her case if she wasn’t arrested for the next six months. As this story went to press, five months after her arrest, she was still fighting in family court to regain custody of her daughter. Outside the courtroom after the hearing for her release, Scott Hechinger, who helped coordinate Adriana’s defense, was exasperated. ‘‘Remember,’’ he said, ‘‘this is all about some diapers! Bail changes the conversation. If bail hadn’t been set, Adriana wouldn’t have to be negotiating to get out of Rikers. She’d just be released.’’ In early 2013, Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the State of New York, decided that the business-as-usual approach to setting bail could not be tolerated any longer. ‘‘We still have a long way to go before we can claim that we have established a coherent, rational approach to pretrial justice,’’ he said in his annual State of the Judiciary address. ‘‘Incarcerating indigent defendants for no other reason than that they cannot meet even a minimum bail amount strips our justice system of its credibility and distorts its operation.’’ Lipp­man sent a package of proposed legislation to reduce the reliance on cash bail to lawmakers in Albany, and he lobbied for the reforms hard in the press. His efforts went nowhere. ‘‘Zero,’’ Lippman says, shaking his head. ‘‘Nothing.’’ Lawmakers had no appetite for bail reform. Two years later, that may be changing. This summer, the New York City Council took a tentative step toward reform by earmarking 1.4 million for a citywide fund to bail out low-level offenders. The fund, proposed with much fanfare by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito in her State of the City address in February, is modeled on a number of smaller bail funds around the city. The oldest of these, the Bronx Freedom Fund, was established in 2007 in association with the Bronx Defenders, a public-defender organization. The founders shut down the fund after only a year and a half, after a judge argued that it was effectively operating as an unlicensed bail-bond business. But before they did, the fund bailed out nearly 200 defendants and generated some illuminating statistics. Ninety-six percent of the fund’s clients made it to every one of their court appearances, a return rate higher even than that of people who posted their own bail. More than half of the Freedom Fund’s clients, now able to fight their cases outside jail, saw their charges completely dismissed. Not a single client went to jail on the charges for which bail had been posted. By comparison, defendants held on bail for the duration of their cases were convicted 92 percent of the time. The numbers showed what everyone familiar with the system already knew anecdotally: Bail makes poor people who would otherwise win their cases plead guilty. Armed with these statistics, as well as a 2010 Human Rights Watch report that calculated that New York City was paying 42 million a year to incarcerate nonfelony defendants, the Freedom Fund’s founders managed to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation explicitly legalizing nonprofit bail funds. In 2013, the Freedom Fund resumed operation. Close behind was the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, begun by Scott Hechinger and a colleague at Brooklyn Defender Services. It was opened this spring and has already bailed out more than 60 clients. But even the staunchest supporters of bail funds are quick to say that they are, at best, temporary Band-Aids for a broken system. ‘‘They are a useful form of relief as long as people are being locked up because they’re poor,’’ says Hechinger, who is no longer affiliated with the Brooklyn bail fund. ‘‘They’re an intervention for an urgent need. But they’re not actual bail reform.’’ Earlier this summer, in the wake of the shocking suicide of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager arrested on suspicion of stealing a backpack and held on bail for three years in Rikers before his case was dismissed, Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled his own initiative. ‘‘I wish, I deeply wish, we hadn’t lost him — but he did not die in vain,’’ de Blasio said. The centerpiece of de Blasio’s initiative is a 17.8 million citywide initiative based on pilot programs that have been running in Queens and Manhattan, offering something called ‘‘supervised release.’’ Under these programs, a small number of qualifying defendants, who might otherwise be held on bail, are instead set free and required to check in with caseworkers by phone and in person. The pilot programs have shown good results, but they have narrowly tailored eligibility requirements. Tyrone Tomlin, for example, would not have been eligible because he had too many previous convictions. Kalief Browder would not have been eligible, either, because the crime he was accused of, stealing a backpack, was charged as second-degree robbery, a violent felony. ‘‘If Kalief Browder’s death wasn’t in vain,’’ says Peter Goldberg, executive director of the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, ‘‘it won’t be because of the proposals we’ve seen so far from the city.’’ The only truly meaningful reform, many observers agree, is to take money out of the bail process entirely. Lippman has been championing this idea for several years. ‘‘You have to eliminate cash bail,’’ he says. The ramifications of such a move are far-reaching. Without bail — and the quick guilty pleas that it produces — courts would come under significant strain. ‘‘The system would shut down,’’ Goldberg says. ‘‘A lot of the 250 people who were waiting to be arraigned in Brooklyn last night would all be coming back to court soon to go forward with a trial for a misdemeanor that no one has any interest in pursuing.’’ This crisis, Goldberg believes, would be a good thing. ‘‘You want pressure on the system. You want everyone involved to be reconsidering. Because of how much it could clog the system, you might have people on high telling cops to stop picking people up for an open-container violation, because ‘I don’t want to deal with it in my courtroom.’ ’’ The idea of eliminating cash bail is hardly unprecedented. When Washington overhauled its bail system in the 1980s and ’90s, it instituted a supervised-release program and other measures designed to reduce the number of people held on bail. But judges continued to set bail until the law was rewritten to effectively forbid the imprisonment of people on financial grounds. The number of people locked up on bail plummeted. ‘‘D.C. had all the tools in place,’’ says Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute. ‘‘They just needed a way to change the court culture.’’ Kentucky, Colorado and, last year, New Jersey have joined Washington in adopting legislation severely curtailing bail’s use. The more modest reforms being proposed in New York City, Goldberg says, are hardly cause for celebration. ‘‘Robert Kennedy, when he was attorney general, raised exactly the concerns with bail we’re talking about now,’’ he says. ‘‘Fifty years later, we’re still having the conversation. We can’t be satisfied with cosmetic fixes. And the truth is, even meaningful bail reform is just the beginning. The real work is asking why we’re arresting so many people on low-level offenses in the first place, and why so many of them come from poor black and brown communities. Bail is easy.’’ In late June, Tyrone Tomlin sat at a picnic table in St. John’s Park in Crown Heights, trying to cool down after a hot day of work and sipping bodega iced tea through a straw. Beneath his baseball cap, his left eye still looked askew, his gaze unfocused and hard to meet. ‘‘My sight is still a little blurry,’’ he said. ‘‘I still feel the aftereffects. Pains in my eye, in my head.’’ The whole situation could have been worse, he knows. He could have been hurt more seriously at Rikers. He could have been fired from his construction job, after being a no-show for the better part of a month while locked up. But even so, he was still angry about what happened last winter. ‘‘I’m not no prince,’’ he acknowledged. ‘‘But I got a raw deal.’’ The inability to make bail has been a virtual constant in Tomlin’s life. His first encounter with the law came when he was 14 or 15 — he recalls being picked up on a robbery charge and sent to Spofford juvenile detention center in the Bronx because his family couldn’t pay bail. After a few months, he says, he pleaded guilty and received probation. ‘‘They said it’s supposed to teach you a lesson,’’ he said. ‘‘It just got me worse.’’ In two-thirds of the times he has pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in the last 14 years, he did so either at arraignment to avoid being sent to Rikers or after already spending as much as two weeks at Rikers. Not once has he been able to pay bail. “I’m not Johnny Rich-Kid with a silver spoon,” he says. For Tomlin, the historical evolutions of bail and pretrial jurisprudence are abstractions without meaning in his life. Bail is simply a feature of the landscape, the thing that means he is locked up when someone with more money wouldn’t be. ‘‘Sure, yeah, I’m mad about it,’’ he said grudgingly. ‘‘But that’s the way it is. I’ve got to accept it. It’s not right, but it’s the way it is.’’ He shrugged. ‘‘What are you going to do?’’ Nick Pinto is a freelance journalist living in Brooklyn.

Write a title for this article: SAN FRANCISCO  Apple encroached upon Google’s turf on Tuesday with its acquisition of Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company. The sale, which Quattro announced, is the latest sign that the mobile phone is the next battleground for technology companies, particularly for Apple and Google, which are increasingly in competition. Apple paid close to 300 million for Quattro, according to a person briefed on the deal. While Apple, maker of the iPhone, branched into advertising on Tuesday, Google, which is predominantly an advertising company, began selling its first piece of consumer hardware, the Nexus One cellphone. “You can just see the tempers rising between the two companies,” said Gene Munster, the senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray covering Internet companies. “Two years ago it was a very friendly relationship. Now just every day it gets more competitive.” In November, Google agreed to buy AdMob, a mobile advertising network that competed with Quattro, for 750 million. Apple had also been interested in AdMob, according to people with knowledge of that deal. With Quattro, Apple will also compete in the mobile ad market with Microsoft and Yahoo. Apple is probably less interested in profiting from ads than in making the iPhone the most attractive device for developers to build applications, analysts said. Eighty percent of the three billion downloads from Apple’s App Store are free, Mr. Munster said. By offering a way to sell ads, Apple will help these developers  as well as developers who might build applications for a future Apple tablet  make money. “My hypothesis is this has more to do with ensuring their platform is as valuable to developers as any other platform,” said Julie A. Ask, a vice president and mobile analyst at Forrester, a research firm. Quattro  which is based in Waltham, Mass., and was financed by Highland Capital Partners and Globespan Capital Partners  places ads for major companies including Ford, Procter & Gamble and Visa. It serves four billion ad impressions a month on iPhones, Google Android devices and other smartphones. The ads range from full-blown applications or videos to small brand ads on a group of Web sites including those of Time, CBS Interactive and Gawker Media. The business of placing ads on cellphone screens is nascent but quickly growing. Advertisers spent just 416 million on mobile ads in 2009, compared with 22 billion on Web sites, according to eMarketer. Yet mobile ad spending is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2013, as smartphones and other small mobile computing devices become increasingly popular. Seventeen percent of adult cellphone subscribers in the United States have smartphones, up from 11 percent a year ago, according to Forrester.

Only half of Americans see Christmas as a religious holiday these days, and plan to go to church, however a surprising three quarters say they believe in the virgin birth. New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration steeped in traditions like gift giving and getting together with family rather than a time for religious reflection. While about seven out of 10 Americans said they typically attended religious services to mark the holiday when they were children, only 54 per cent say they plan to attend Christmas services this year. Scroll down for video. Only half of Americans see Christmas as more of a religious holiday these days. 'There are significant generational differences in the way Americans plan to celebrate Christmas this year, with younger adults less likely than older adults to incorporate religious elements into their holiday celebrations,' the report states. People aged 29 with be the least represented age group at mass, with only 46 per cent planning to go along, compared to 60 per cent of over 65s. Women are also more inclined to go to church than men, 58 per cent compared to 50 per cent, and parents with children at home are more likely to attend a service than those whose kids have flown the nest. New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration. Younger adults are less likely than older adults to incorporate religious elements into their holiday celebrations, Pew found. Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood. While lower than in the past, the proportion of people who plan to go to church, 54 per cent, is significantly higher to the 36 per cent of people who attend services every Sunday. About nine out of 10 adults who see Christmas as a religious holiday said they believe Jesus was born of a virgin. Interestingly, however, even among those who celebrate Christmas as a cultural holiday and those who do not celebrate Christmas, roughly half said they believe in the virgin birth. Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood. 'This type of gathering is common among all demographic and religious groups in the population,' the research states. They also plan to buy gifts for their loved ones. Around 80 per cent said they have put up a Christmas tree, slightly less than the number who said they had a fir when they were children, and the practice of sending Christmas or holiday cards and caroling has fallen out of fashion throughout the years. Only 31 per cent of people said they would pretend Santa Claus will visit their home, compared to 72 per cent who said this was a tradition when they were younger. The survey, conducted December 3-8, 2013, among 2,001 adults nationwide, found commercialization of Christmas was the most frustrating thing for American families. One-third say they dislike the materialism of the holidays, one-fifth dislike the expenses associated with the season, and one-tenth dislike holiday shopping and the crowded malls and stores.

Hardy Rodenstock (born December 7, 1941 in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), legal name Meinhard Gorke ) is a former publisher and manager of pop and Schlager music in Germany and is a prominent wine collector, connoisseur, and trader, with a special interest in old and rare wines. He became famous for his allegedly uncanny ability to track down old and very rare wines, and for arranging extravagant wine tastings featuring these wines. It has been alleged that Rodenstock is the perpetrator of an elaborate wine fraud. In 1992, a German court found that Rodenstock had \\"knowingly offered adulterated wine\\" for sale. In May 2008, a book about the controversy was published under the title The Billionaire's Vinegar, written by Benjamin Wallace. In the book a tritium test and two carbon-14 tests date the wine circa 1962. Later, a cesium-137 test gave similar results. Rodenstock was not available for comments on the publication of the book. Auctioneer Michael Broadbent, on the other hand, was unhappy with how his relationship to Rodenstock was portrayed in the book. In July 2009 it was announced that Michael Broadbent would sue Random House, the publishers of The Billionaire's Vinegar, for libel and defamation of character, on claims that the book made allegations that suggested that Broadbent had behaved in an unprofessional manner in the way in which he had auctioned some of these bottles and that his relationship and dealings with Hardy Rodenstock was suspected of being improper. The suit was filed in the United Kingdom, whose libel laws are favorable to the plaintiff. Unlike U.S. law, in English defamation law even true allegations can be defamatory. Random House initially stated it did not believe it had defamed Broadbent and would defend the lawsuit. In October 2009, Random House, avoiding trial, entered into a settlement agreement with Broadbent. In a statement read out in open court, Random House apologised unreservedly for making the allegations, and accepted that they were untrue. It gave an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and paid Broadbent undisclosed damages. It removed the book from sale in the United Kingdom. It also was reported that Wallace was not a party to the lawsuit or settlement, that Random House would be making no changes to the book, and that it would continue to publish the book in all territories except the UK. The film rights to The Billionaire's Vinegar have been purchased by a Hollywood consortium, while HBO simultaneously had bought the film rights to the corresponding The New Yorker article.","completion":"This text is about Hardy Rodenstock, a former publisher and manager of pop and Schlager music in Germany, who later became a prominent wine collector, connoisseur, and trader with a special interest in old and rare wines.

On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011. Why didn't Neptune appear to be in it's exact discover position? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Neptune did not appear in its exact discovery position for a couple of reasons: 1. Earth's position: The Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical path, taking approximately 365.26 days to complete one orbit. Due to this, the Earth's position relative to the Sun changes continually. On 11 July 2011, when Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, the Earth was in a different location in its orbit compared to where it was during Neptune's discovery. This difference in the Earth's position affected the observed location of Neptune in the sky. 2. Heliocentric vs. barycentric coordinate systems: The motion of celestial bodies can be measured using different coordinate systems. Heliocentric coordinates place the Sun at the center, while barycentric coordinates consider the center of mass of the entire Solar System (the barycenter) as the reference point. In the given context, Neptune was said to have completed a full barycentric orbit, meaning it returned to its discovery position with respect to the Solar System's barycenter. However, due to the Sun's motion around this barycenter, Neptune did not return to its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun (i.e., in the heliocentric coordinate system). The discovery longitude in the heliocentric coordinate system was reached a day later, on 12 July 2011. So, the combination of the Earth's changing position in its orbit and the difference between heliocentric and barycentric coordinate systems resulted in Neptune not appearing at its exact discovery position on 11 July 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords. - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda). - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy). - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461 1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Arrest after Arkansas Realtor Beverly Carter vanishes (CNN) -- A manhunt for a 33-year-old sought in connection with the disappearance of an Arkansas real estate agent ended with his arrest Monday, police say. The Little Rock Police Department arrested Arron Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, after an arrest warrant issued Sunday said he was charged with kidnapping. The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter. Carter went to show a home in the city of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished. Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police, while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Police took Arron Lewis' photo after a Sunday traffic accident. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident and \\"Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,\\" the report says. Another witness told police that \\"the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,\\" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said. \\"While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,\\" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They were to resume their search Monday. The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he \\"knew something was wrong.\\" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the sheriff's office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The sheriff's office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. \\"I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,\\" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. \\"She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.\\" The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that \\"I would just like to have my wife back.\\" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said. CNN's John Branch and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","completion":"A manhunt for a 33-year-old, Arron Lewis, in connection with the disappearance of an Arkansas real estate agent, Beverly Carter, ended with his arrest.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Question: Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because _ . Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Some two thousand million years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because another star came near to our sun. The proximity of this wandering star would have likely caused large tides on the sun's surface, similar to how the sun and moon cause tides on Earth. As this star came closer to the sun, these tides would have crafted a high mountain. As the star moved away, its powerful tidal pull tore the mountain into small pieces and hurled them into space.

Movie title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines... A:","completion":"In the movie Sucker Punch, Babydoll notes five items that she needs to collect in order to escape the asylum. These items are: 1. A Map: This item is crucial for planning their escape route from the institution. It provides the necessary information for navigating through the building, corridors, and any possible obstacles they might encounter along the way. 2. Fire: Fire is necessary for creating a diversion, causing chaos, or destroying some of the obstacles the girls may encounter during their escape. This element can be used to create explosions or simply catch the attention of the staff, allowing the girls to proceed with their escape plan without being detected. 3. A Knife: A weapon is essential to defend themselves or attack when needed during the escape. The knife, being a versatile and easy-to-conceal weapon, is a suitable choice for the girls, especially considering the confined spaces they may encounter inside the asylum. 4. A Key: The key is fundamental to unlock doors and bypass security measures put in place within the institution. Without the key, Babydoll and her friends would face significant challenges in their attempt to escape, as they might end up trapped in locked rooms or unable to open necessary doors. 5. The Fifth item - \\"A deep sacrifice\\" resulting in a \\"perfect victory\\": The fifth item is not revealed until later in the movie, and it represents a significant emotional or physical sacrifice. The true meaning behind this item becomes apparent as the story unfolds, and it serves as an important thematic element within the overall narrative. By collecting these five items, Babydoll and her friends attempt to devise an escape plan and break free from the confines of the asylum in the movie Sucker Punch. Each item plays a crucial role in moving the plot forward and further developing the characters' struggles and relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery.

Article: Tulou, the special residential architecture of Fujian Province was included on the UNESCO's World Heritage List during the 32ndsession of the World Heritage Committee in Quebec, Canada. In the fourth century, Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south, gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities. As a defence against enemies, the Hakkas chose to live in compact communities, and the tulou was their preferred houses. Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province. Most tulous are to be found in the valleys, surrounded by high mountains, and some are in the depths of the great mountains. Most are three to four stories high, and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens, rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms. For defensive purposes, the rooms on the first floor have no windows. Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally. Their main building material was a mixture of clay, sand, lime and water, and egg whites, brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls. Once they dried, the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult. Fir branches, which are extremely strong and do not rot, were used to strengthen them, and many centuries later they have remained their original look. Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently, and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks. The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect, who paid several visits to Yongding, to build a tulou back home. Not long after, an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away, and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down, his tulou remained. Question: From the passage , we know that Tulou _ .

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Since even the smallest speck of asbestos can cause health problems, it’s a good idea to completely clear out the room that you’ll be taking a sample from. If you can’t remove all the furniture, then push it far away from the sampling area and cover it all with plastic drop cloths. If you remove a sample from a ceiling, then asbestos particles can become airborne if you have air circulating in the room. To keep this from happening, turn off your heating or cooling system. Shut any windows or doors and keep any fans turned off. Wear coveralls or outer clothing that you won’t mind throwing away after taking the sample. You can usually buy disposable coveralls for 5-10 at your local hardware store. Wear heavy disposable gloves as well. And, put on a breathing mask (a paper one is fine) and goggles, too. It’s bad to let asbestos touch your skin, so keep totally covered. Remember that you’ll need to toss everything that you’ve worn on the outside, including goggles and gloves. So, don’t spend a lot on them. While you are taking the sample and before you’ve fully cleaned up, don’t let anyone else in the room. Get industrial plastic sheeting from your hardware store. Place this sheeting on the floor directly under where you’ll take the sample. Use duct tape to secure the sheeting to the floor, so that it won’t shift around. Set your ladder directly on top of the sheeting and under where you’ll take the sample. When you’ve finished placing the plastic, get a spray bottle and mist the whole space with water. This helps to keep any dust particles from floating around. It’s not necessary to saturate any surfaces, just a quick spraying will do fine.","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on preparing a room for asbestos sampling, emphasizing safety precautions such as clearing the space, turning off air circulation, wearing disposable protective gear, isolating the sampling area with plastic sheeting, and using a spray bottle to minimize airborne particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, a young herbalist named Elara discovers a long-forgotten family secret while deciphering her late grandmother's journals. In her writings, Elara uncovers the existence of a rare and powerful poison, known as the Crimson Elixir, which has the ability to put an end to the reign of the vampire queen once and for all. Teaming up with her childhood friend, Alaric, a skilled swordsman and hunter, Elara embarks on a daring quest to gather the obscure ingredients required to brew the elixir.

To truly answer the question, a more comprehensive analysis of various objectives and strategies for enhancing the education of young children is required. Several key initiatives and goals that various governments, organizations, and stakeholders want to achieve concerning the education of young children are as follows: 1. Universal access to quality education: The primary objective when it comes to schooling for young children is to ensure that all children, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have access to quality education. This initiative strives to eliminate child labor and other social barriers that prevent children from attending school. 2. Early childhood education: Another critical aspect of young children's education is providing early childhood education, which plays a vital role in laying a solid foundation for learning and personal development. Ensuring that quality early childhood programs are implemented in all countries is a significant goal to strive for. 3. Curriculum development and enhancement: The schooling of young children should involve an age-appropriate and well-rounded curriculum that focuses not only on core subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics but also on life skills, social development, and cultural awareness. This approach aims to provide children with the knowledge and skills they need to become responsible, informed, and engaged citizens. 4. Effective teacher training and support: A crucial aspect of providing quality education for young children is having well-trained and capable educators who can effectively teach and guide them. Investing in teacher training and continuous professional development is necessary for ensuring that educators have the necessary tools and skills to shape young minds. 5. Parent and community engagement: Involving parents and community members in the education process helps create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. Initiatives should include parental education on the importance of schooling, as well as promoting community-based programs and resources that foster educational engagement and success. 6. Monitoring and evaluation: To continually improve educational systems and ensure that all young children receive adequate schooling, it is crucial to establish effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. This process allows for the identification of shortcomings, addressing inequalities, and implementing improvements to provide equitable opportunities for all children. 7. Resource allocation and funding: Adequate funding and resource allocation are vital for implementing the strategies mentioned above and ensuring quality education for young children. Collaborative efforts from governments, organizations, and stakeholders are necessary to invest in education, establish proper infrastructure, allocate funding, and prioritize resources to improve schooling opportunities for young children in areas where it is most needed. In conclusion, while the time-bounded program for countries with high child labor rates and limited schooling opportunities is an essential measure, it is not the full answer to the question. More comprehensive initiatives, such as ensuring universal access to quality education, promoting early childhood education, curriculum development, teacher training, parent and community engagement, monitoring and evaluation, and ensuring adequate resource allocation, all play a vital role in improving the schooling of young children worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: [i] angry at Ash [ii] fed up [iii] angry I heard that Sydney is a boss who wants to fire Ash. And I was wondering How would Sydney feel afterwards? Answer:","completion":"In order to determine how Sydney would feel after wanting to fire Ash, let's go step-by-step: 1. Evaluate the situation: Sydney is a boss who wants to fire Ash. The reasons for this are not explicitly mentioned. 2. Analyze emotions: We have three emotions to select from - angry at Ash, fed up, and angry in general. 3. Relate emotions to the situation: We will link the emotions to the situation to understand their relevance. [i] Angry at Ash: This emotion is explicitly related to Ash, which may connect to Sydney's feelings towards Ash in the given situation. [ii] Fed up: This emotion is associated with being exhausted or feeling done with a situation. It's possible that Sydney is not only angry at Ash but also generally feeling fed up with repeated issues, leading to wanting to fire Ash. [iii] Angry: This is a general emotion that can be caused by multiple factors. While it could be related to Ash, it's not specifically directed towards them. 4. Determine the most appropriate emotion: Based on the analysis, emotions [i] \\"angry at Ash\\" and [ii] \\"fed up\\" seem to be most relevant to the situation, as they are either directly focused on Ash or related to a possible reason behind Sydney's desire to fire Ash. 5. Summarize: Considering the given emotions and their relevance to the situation, Sydney would most likely feel a combination of [i] angry at Ash and [ii] fed up after wanting to fire Ash. This is because Sydney's feelings are directed at Ash and the situation is causing them to be exhausted from dealing with the issues surrounding Ash."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information: - Pitymys is a subgenus of voles in the genus Microtus. Species in this subgenus are: - The tomato (see pronunciation) is the edible fruit of \\"Solanum lycopersicum\\", commonly known as a tomato plant, which belongs to the nightshade family, \\"Solanaceae\\". The species originated in Central and South America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word \\"tomatl\\" gave rise to the Spanish word \\"tomate\\", from which the English word tomato originates. Numerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately . Its use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables, being ingredients of savory meals. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, roots, and bark at other times. The genus is also called \\"meadow voles\\". (ITIS database) The species are: Subgenus \\"Microtus\\" Subgenus \\"Terricola\\" Subgenus \\"Mynomes\\" Subgenus \\"Alexandromys\\" Subgenus \\"Stenocranius\\" Subgenus \\"Pitymys\\" Subgenus \\"Pedomys\\" Subgenus \\"Hyrcanicola\\" - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola . They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia . A water vole found in Western North America was historically considered a member of this genus , but has been shown to be more closely related to members of the genus Microtus ( Conroy and Cook , 2000 ; Musser and Carleton , 2005 ) . Head and body length are 12 -- 22 cm , tail length is 6.5 -- 12.5 cm , and the weight is 70 -- 250 g. The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth . They are thick - furred and have hairy fringe on feet that improves their swimming ability . - Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. - Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: References. D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference. Third Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - In biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.

Televisions, gaming consoles, sound systems, and more – most of these devices now support HDMI connections. But what if you have a non-HDMI device? Worry not! This article will guide you through the process of connecting your non-HDMI device to an HDMI TV. Step 1: Identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI device Before you can connect your non-HDMI device to an HDMI TV, you need to identify an HDMI-compatible port on your device. Common ports that are HDMI-compatible include DVI (Digital Visual Interface), VGA (Video Graphics Array), and DisplayPort. Check your device's manual or do a quick search online to confirm which type of port your device supports. Step 2: Choose the right cable or adapter Once you have identified an HDMI-compatible port on your device, it's time to choose the right cable or adapter. Based on the type of port, you will need either an HDMI-to-DVI cable, HDMI-to-VGA cable, or HDMI-to-DisplayPort cable. Alternatively, you can use a standalone adapter that converts the respective signal to HDMI and then use a regular HDMI cable to connect the adapter to your HDMI TV. Ensure to select a cable or adapter that supports the transmission of audio signals as well if your port supports it. Step 3: Connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV Now that you have the appropriate cable or adapter, locate an available HDMI port on your television. After locating the port, insert the HDMI-A plug from your cable or adapter into the HDMI port on your TV. Step 4: Connect the other end of the cable to the device or adapter Take the other end of your cable and connect it to the HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI device. If you are using a standalone adapter, connect your non-HDMI device to the adapter using the appropriate cable (such as DVI, VGA, or DisplayPort) and then connect the HDMI end of the adapter to your HDMI TV. Step 5: Switch to the HDMI source on your TV After you have connected both ends of the cable or adapter, power on your non-HDMI device and your television. Use your TV's remote control to navigate to the correct HDMI input source. Typically, there is a button labeled \\"Source,\\" \\"Input,\\" or \\"Menu\\" on your remote. Press this button and cycle through the available sources until you find the correct HDMI input that corresponds to the port you connected your non-HDMI device. Step 6: Hook up the audio separately if necessary In some instances, especially with older devices or certain port types, the audio signal may not be transmitted along with the video signal. If this is the case for your specific setup, you will need to connect the audio separately using an appropriate cable. Most commonly, you may require a 3.5mm audio cable (also known as an AUX cable) or an RCA cable, depending on your device's audio output options. Connect the audio cable to the respective audio output on your non-HDMI device and the corresponding audio input ports on your HDMI TV. Conclusion It's easy to feel left behind in a world that increasingly relies on HDMI technology. However, with the steps outlined above, you can easily connect your non-HDMI devices to your HDMI TV and fully enjoy the high-quality audio and video experience that the technology has to offer. Remember to verify your device's compatibility, choose the correct cable or adapter, and follow the connection process step by step.

Background: David \\"Davy\\" Crockett (August 17, 1786 - March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier, and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet \\"King of the Wild Frontier\\". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Texas Revolution. Crockett grew up in East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling. Context: On October 25, 1824, Crockett notified his constituents of his intention to run in the 1825 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost that election to incumbent Adam Rankin Alexander. A chance meeting in 1826 gained him the encouragement of Memphis mayor Marcus Brutus Winchester to try again to win a seat in Congress. The Jackson Gazette published a letter from Crockett on September 15, 1826 announcing his intention of again challenging Rankin, and stating his opposition to the policies of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay and to Rankin's position on the cotton tariff. Militia veteran William Arnold also entered the race, and Crockett easily defeated both political opponents for the 1827-29 term. He arrived in Washington D.C. and took up residence at Mrs. Ball's Boarding House, where a number of other legislators lived when Congress was in session. Jackson was elected as President in 1828. Crockett continued his legislative focus on settlers getting a fair deal for land titles, offering H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk. Crockett was re-elected for the 1829-31 session, once again defeating Adam Rankin Alexander. He introduced H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was defeated on May 3. On February 25, 1830, he introduced a resolution to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York because he felt that it was public money going to benefit the sons of wealthy men. He spoke out against Congress giving 100,000 to the widow of Stephen Decatur, citing that Congress was not empowered to do that. He opposed Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act and was the only member of the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. Cherokee chief John Ross sent him a letter on January 13, 1831 expressing his thanks for Crockett's vote. His vote was not popular with his own district, and he was defeated in the 1831 election by William Fitzgerald. Crockett ran against Fitzgerald again in the 1833 election and was returned to Congress, serving until 1835. On January 2, 1834, he introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126, but it never made it as far as being debated on the House floor. He was defeated for re-election in the August 1835 election by Adam Huntsman. During his last term in Congress, he collaborated with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton to write his autobiography, which was published by E. L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself, and he went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quotation attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state: I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas. Question: what did he do in the house. Whats the answer?","completion":"Davy Crockett was a man who lived a long time ago and was a part of the group of people who helped make important decisions for the country. This group is called the House of Representatives. He fought for the rights of people who settled in new lands, making sure they were treated fairly when they bought land. He also tried to make changes to some laws, but not all of them worked out. Mr. Crockett believed that everyone, not just rich people, should have the same opportunities, so he tried to make the government spend money fairly. He also didn't like how some Native American tribes were being treated, so he voted against a law that would remove them from their homes. Even though he didn't always win, Davy Crockett worked hard for what he thought was right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Sherman was born in Chicago, to Percy Copelon and Rose Sherman. Percy was an auto mechanic and race car driver who, like his son, suffered from obesity (he weighed over 350 pounds), and died while attempting a 100-day diet. His family was Jewish. Sherman's parents divorced when he was in grade school, and the son adopted his mother's maiden name. Context: One track from My Son, the Nut, a spoof of summer camp entitled \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\", became a surprise novelty hit, reaching No. 2 on the national Billboard Hot 100 chart for three weeks in late summer 1963. The lyrics were sung to the tune of one segment of Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours, familiar to the public because of its use in the Walt Disney film Fantasia. That December, Sherman's \\"The Twelve Gifts of Christmas\\" single appeared on Billboard's separate Christmas chart. Sherman had one other Top 40 hit, a 1965 take-off on the Petula Clark hit \\"Downtown\\" called \\"Crazy Downtown\\", which spent one week at #40. Two other Sherman singles charted in the lower regions of the Billboard 100: an updated \\"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh\\" (#59 in 1964), and \\"The Drinking Man's Diet\\" (#98 in 1965). Sherman's \\"The End of a Symphony\\", spotlighting Arthur Fiedler's Boston Pops Orchestra, reached #113 on the \\"Bubbling Under\\" chart in 1964, but did not make the Hot 100. The songs on Sherman's next album My Name Is Allan (1965) were thematically connected: except for a couple of original novelty songs with music by Sherman and Busch, all the songs on the album are parodies of songs that had won, or were nominated for, the Academy Award for Best Song. They included \\"That Old Black Magic\\", \\"Secret Love\\", \\"The Continental\\", \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" and \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\". The cover of the album bore a childhood photograph of Sherman. That, and the album's title, were references to Barbra Streisand's album My Name Is Barbra, released earlier that year, which featured a cover photograph of the singer as a young girl. During his brief heyday, Sherman's parodies were so popular that he had at least one contemporary imitator: My Son the Copycat was an album of song parodies performed by Stanley Ralph Ross, co-written by Ross and Bob Arbogast. Lest there be any doubt of whom Ross is copying, his album's cover bears a crossed-out photo of Sherman. One of the songs on this album is a fat man's lament, \\"I'm Called Little Butterball\\", parodying \\"I'm Called Little Buttercup\\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta HMS Pinafore.

The rest of the players, including the hammy Naschy, are a complete write-off (though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing). Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf/Frankenstein/Dr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous (at least in the English version), that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed. Zabalza's direction seems jerky, even amateurish. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's over-bright lighting. Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, though the stridently over-emphatic music score and the laughably crude, totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.","completion":"Step 1: Read the text thoroughly to understand the tone and message.

Step 3: Analyze the overall sentiment of the text. A majority of negative words and phrases are used throughout the review, reflecting the writer's dissatisfaction with various aspects of the movie. Only a small positive mention is given regarding the presence of Perla Cristal, which is not enough to outweigh the negative aspects discussed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The initial information given is that \\"Today, our GDP, adjusted for inflation, is twice as big as it was in 1972.\\" This means the present GDP, after accounting for inflation, is double the value in 1972. 2.

Before Carson can check Sasha's mailbox for her, there are several steps he needs to follow. This includes communication, trust-building, understanding her needs, and maintaining boundaries. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps Carson should take: 1. Establish a rapport with Sasha: If they're not already friends or acquaintances, Carson should first attempt to create a friendly environment for conversation. This can be done by engaging in small talk, finding common interests, or simply by being open and approachable. 2. Assess Sasha's need for assistance: Before offering to do any favors for Sasha, Carson should determine whether she indeed requires help. This can be done by listening to her concerns, understanding her schedule and availability, and evaluating whether checking her mailbox is something she might actually need assistance with. It's important for Carson to not just assume that she needs help, but to genuinely understand her situation. 3. Offer to help: Once Carson has determined that Sasha might need help with her mailbox, he should kindly offer his assistance. He should clearly communicate that he's willing to check her mailbox for her, making sure to specify when he's available, and explaining his reasons or motivations for offering the favor. This not only provides transparency but also allows Sasha to make an informed decision. 4. Obtain consent: It's important for Carson to get Sasha's permission to perform this favor. He should ask for her explicit consent and ensure that she's comfortable with him checking her mailbox. Her consent should not be assumed or coerced, as it's crucial to prioritize her comfort and privacy. 5. Set boundaries: If Sasha agrees to let Carson check her mailbox, they should both establish some ground rules and boundaries. This may include discussing the frequency of the checks, any limitations regarding handling or opening her mail (if applicable), and any additional preferences that Sasha may have. This allows both parties to have a clear understanding of the expectations and prevents any potential misunderstandings. 6. Show respect and maintain trust: Once Carson has her consent, he should carry out the favor in a reliable and respectful manner, ensuring that he abides by the established boundaries and communicates with Sasha regularly. Showing respect and maintaining trust are key factors in building a lasting and positive relationship. By talking to Sasha and understanding her needs, Carson demonstrates his willingness to help and his respect for her privacy. This, in turn, allows him to perform the favor, thus fostering a supportive and trusting relationship between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It lacks details that are present in the initial premise which involve both the individual's identity (a man in a US Army uniform) and the presence of another person (a scientist in a lab coat). Therefore, though the given statement \\"A man is looking through a microscope\\" is true, it does not fully confirm or ascertain the truthfulness of the entire premise: \\"A man in a US Army uniform looks through a microscope as a scientist in a lab coat looks over his shoulder.\\" Let's break the premise down into its constituent elements: 1.

Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.

If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the moon than on earth\\" is \\"The moons gravity is weaker than earth's?\\"? OPT: [-] no; [-] yes;","completion":"First, let's compute the weight of a person with a mass of 50 kg on Earth. In order to do that, we will use the formula: Weight = Mass × Gravity On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². Therefore, the weight of the person on Earth would be: Weight = 50 kg × 9.81 m/s² Weight ≈ 490.5 N (Newtons) Now, let's discuss the force of gravity and how it changes. You are correct in stating that the force of gravity is the same everywhere on Earth, but it varies on other planetary bodies like the Moon. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the planetary body and the distance between the object and the center of the planetary body. When astronauts travel from Earth to other celestial bodies within our solar system, including the Moon, the strength of the gravitational force changes. As you mentioned, astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. and Neil Armstrong were the first humans to walk on the Moon, and an astronaut weighs less on the Moon than they do on Earth because the Moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's. This is due to the Moon having only about 1/6th of Earth's gravity. The mass of an object does not change when it goes from one place to another because mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object, and this remains constant no matter where the object is located. The concept of weight, on the other hand, varies with the force of gravity. Consequently, the astronaut's mass did not change when he was on the Moon compared to when he was on Earth. Given that the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth and 29 pounds on the Moon, if his mass on Earth was 80 kg, his mass on the Moon would also be 80 kg, as mass does not change based on location. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the Moon than on Earth?\\" is \\"The Moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's.\\" Your understanding of the relationship between mass, weight, and the force of gravity is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are on a whaling boat in search of whales. Donald tries to eat a sandwich for lunch, but seagulls bother and harass him to get the sandwich and end up eating most of it. While Donald is preoccupied with fighting off the gulls, a pelican eats the remainder of the sandwich. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to pitch a bucket of water off the ship, but it keeps coming back to him, to his annoyance. Donald and Goofy spot a sleeping whale, but Goofy's efforts to shoot a harpoon keep failing because he doesn't have all the tools needed (at one point, he sets his own bottom on fire). He eventually succeeds in launching the anchor in plaace of the harpoon, but his foot gets caught in the attached line and when the anchor hits an iceberg he ends up hanging from the line above the whale's head. Donald rushes to Goofy's rescue, but isn't fast enough and Goofy falls off the line, through the whale's blowhole, and ends up in the whale's mouth. Lighting a match so he can see better, Goofy inadvertently wakes the whale up and it starts coughing. A wave comes in through the whale's open mouth and washes Goofy around. He gets blown out of the whale's blowhole and falls back down, his head getting stuck in the blowhole. Meanwhile, Donald falls into the water and is chased by the angry whale back to the ship, where, after Donald is nearly eaten, the whale rams and destroys the ship. Mickey, Donald and Goofy fly through the air and land on a small raft made of the ship's debris. Goofy ends up with a fish in his hands, and, believing it is the whale, says, \\"Gosh, must have shrunk!\\" The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, there are two kinds of birds that eat Donald Duck's sandwich: seagulls and a pelican. The seagulls are described as bothersome and persistent, continually harassing Donald in an attempt to get his sandwich. They ultimately succeed in eating most of the sandwich, demonstrating their determination and opportunistic nature. Seagulls are often found around coastal areas and are known for their scavenging behavior, particularly when it comes to human food, which explains their interest in Donald's sandwich. In addition to the seagulls, a pelican also consumes a part of Donald Duck's sandwich. While Donald is preoccupied with keeping the seagulls at bay, the pelican swoops in and eats the remainder of the sandwich. Pelicans are large aquatic birds known for their long beaks and large throat pouches, which they use to scoop up fish (and apparently sandwiches). They are somewhat more opportunistic and less aggressive than seagulls but are still known to snatch food when the opportunity arises. In summary, the kinds of birds that eat Donald Duck's sandwich in the article are seagulls and a pelican. The seagulls harass him in an attempt to steal the sandwich, while the pelican capitalizes on the situation and consumes the remaining portion of the sandwich. Both types of birds demonstrate opportunistic and scavenging behavior, showcasing their adaptability and resourcefulness in acquiring food, even from unusual sources like a cartoon character's sandwich."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the audience listens attentively, the man in the blue shirt elaborates on the biomechanics involved in this seemingly simple but oftentimes challenging skill. With a passion for the sport clearly evident in his voice, he explains that the key to handling high balls effectively is maintaining a proper stance, in which a player's feet are shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. This allows them to react quickly and maintain balance while keeping their eyes focused on the incoming ball. In addition to proper body positioning, the man emphasizes the role of grip strength in securing the racket handle. A firm and consistent grip allows for better control over the trajectory of the ball. He also demonstrates the importance of following through on the swing to ensure that the racket stays in contact with the ball for as long as possible, leading to a more powerful and accurate shot. Elaborating on the role of the forearm in this process, the man in the blue shirt points out that it acts as a lever, helping to accelerate the racket head through the contact point with the ball. He suggests practicing small, controlled forearm movements to improve muscle memory and increase overall agility in high-pressure situations on the tennis court. He then shifts the focus to the importance of anticipating the ball's trajectory and adjusting one's position accordingly. By staying light on their toes and engaging their leg muscles, players can make it easier for their arms and forearms to do the work when the moment of contact arrives. As the man in the blue shirt wraps up his presentation, he emphasizes that mastering these techniques is crucial for both amateur and professional tennis players who wish to excel in their game. By integrating the proper use of their forearms with other essential components - such as footwork, body positioning, and anticipation - players can significantly improve their ability to handle high balls and gain a substantial competitive edge over their opponents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The perturbation caused by a great deal of underground activity affecting less or smaller eruptions can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process in the formation and eruption of a volcano. To elaborate further, let's first understand the process of volcanic eruption step by step: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are produced during different geological processes. These gases accumulate underneath the Earth's surface, leading to an increase in pressure. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As the pressure beneath the earth increases, it forces magma, a molten or semi-molten rock material, upward through fissures or cracks in the Earth's crust. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools down and forms volcanic rocks. Over time, these solidified rocks gradually build up and form a volcanic edifice. 4. With enough time the pressure builds up greatly: If the pressure from the gases continues to increase over time, a significant build-up of pressure occurs beneath the volcano. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: When the pressure becomes too high, it can cause a volcanic eruption. The magma and gases escape from the volcano, producing various eruption styles, from smaller and less violent eruptions to large and explosive ones. Now, let's consider the effect of increased underground activity on smaller eruptions. The increased underground activity, such as seismic events, tectonic plate movements, or increased heat flow, can impact magma generation and movement, as well as gas pressure beneath the Earth's crust. This may change the style and magnitude of eruptions but does not directly impact any specific step of the process. As a result, the underground activity can have an indirect effect on the process of volcanic eruptions. For instance, increased underground activity could cause fractures or faults in the Earth's crust, providing new pathways for magma and gases to escape, thus potentially reducing the buildup of pressure that may have led to a larger eruption. Alternatively, it may cause local changes in the magma chamber, altering the composition and viscosity of the magma, which may affect the eruption style and produce smaller or less frequent eruptions. In conclusion, a great deal of underground activity might indirectly impact a step of the volcanic eruption process, leading to changes in the scale and style of eruptions, including less or smaller eruptions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: LaDainian Tomlinson made history by becoming the fastest running back to reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexander's single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexander's mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222&#160;yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denver's Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter to make it a 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elam's 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like last week against the Bengals, the Chargers wouldn't say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 at the end of the third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos' cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos' lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummer's 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game.

Her other daughters Maggie (Lauren Graham) and Mae (Piper Perabo) are happily married but Milly has recently broken up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned. Daphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter. She finds a potential candidate, Jason (Tom Everett Scott), and tries to orchestrate a chance meeting of the two. The plan seems flawless until Milly finds her own date, guitarist Johnny (Gabriel Macht), who happens to be a candidate Daphne rejected before. Milly is unaware of her mother's scheming and begins relationships with both Jason and Johnny at the same time, with neither aware of the other. Inevitably, this double-dating takes its toll and Milly becomes estranged from both Jason and Johnny. In Jason's case, it is because she discovers Daphne's scheming.

Which entity is this text about? Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.

Questions: He was eating too much while no exercising enough, what did he suffer as a result? Options: - hungry - gas - obesity - gain weight - feeling full Answer:","completion":"He was eating too much while not exercising enough, and as a result, he suffered from obesity and gain weight. These two outcomes are aligned with common sense since excessive eating and a sedentary lifestyle directly contribute to an increase in body fat and weight gain. When a person consumes more calories than they burn through physical activity, the surplus calories are stored as body fat. If this behavior continues for an extended period, it can lead to significant weight gain and obesity. Obesity is a medical condition characterized by an excessive amount of body fat. It can increase the risk of various health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While the other options might be partially correct in certain instances, they don't fully capture the result of the person's behavior. For example, feeling hungry or full can be temporary sensations experienced during the day, whereas gas may be experienced occasionally due to various factors like consuming gas-producing foods. However, these options do not necessarily suggest a long-term pattern of consistently eating too much and not exercising enough. Hence, obesity and gain weight are the options most in line with common sense to answer the question about the consequences of overeating and insufficient exercise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The silver accessory around her neck glinted in the stage lights, but in a different way from the bling worn by many of the other contestants. In a sight that to many was pretty refreshing amidst a sea of sequins, stilettos and jewels, Johnson emerged onto the stage in blue scrubs and sneakers. She complimented her outfit with the only necklace that goes best with scrubs -- a stethoscope. Her attire simply reflected what all nurses are required to wear.

Options: a ) 6 , b ) 8 1 / 1 , c ) 8 1 / 4 , d ) 8 1 / 2 , e ) 8 3 / 7","completion":"To calculate when the cistern will be filled, first, we need to find the combined rate of the pipes filling the cistern. Pipe A fills the cistern in 12 minutes, so it fills 1/12 of the cistern per minute. Pipe B fills the cistern in 15 minutes, so it fills 1/15 of the cistern per minute. When both pipes are opened together, they fill: (1/12 + 1/15) of the cistern per minute. This simplifies to: (15 + 12) / (12 * 15) = 27 / 180 = 3/20 So, together they fill 3/20 of the cistern per minute. They work together for 4 minutes and fill: 4 * (3/20) = 12/20 or 3/5 of the cistern. Now, 2/5 of the cistern still needs to be filled, and as A is turned off, B works alone. Since Pipe B fills 1/15 of the cistern per minute, we can calculate the time it takes to fill 2/5 of the cistern: (2/5) / (1/15) = 2/5 * 15/1 = 6 So it takes 6 more minutes for Pipe B to fill the remaining 2/5 of the cistern.

Answer:","completion":"(I) No. Based on the review provided, it appears that the user would not recommend this product. The user expresses several concerns and criticisms about the book, which indicates dissatisfaction with their reading experience. Some of the reasons for not recommending the book are: 1. The user describes the second part of \\"La Leyenda del Águila y el Jaguar\\" as boring and too simple. This indicates that they did not find the plot engaging or complex enough to hold their interest. 2. The user mentions that events in the book happen one after the other without significant weight, leading to a hurried ending that does not solidify properly. This suggests that they felt the pace of the narrative was off and that the story lacked a satisfying resolution. 3. The user also criticizes the characterization of the protagonists, Alex and Nadia, saying that they are written like foolish adults instead of intelligent teenagers as they should be. This indicates that the user did not find the characters relatable or well-developed, negatively impacting their overall enjoyment of the book. 4. Lastly, the user states that the book did not \\"capture\\" them like \\"La ciudad de las bestias\\" did and that it appears to be just the first draft of the novel.

His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?, what is it ?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\"?

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine the truth value of both sentences, let's first analyze their content and context. Sentence 1: \\"Yeah, wait for it to come out on videotape, I guess.\\" - In this sentence, the speaker seems to be suggesting that the listener should wait for something to come out on videotape. The phrase \\"I guess\\" indicates some uncertainty or lack of enthusiasm in the speaker's suggestion. Sentence 2: \\"Wait for it to come out on video.\\" - This sentence also suggests waiting for something to come out on video. It is more direct and clear compared to the first sentence. Now, let's analyze if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Step 1: Determine the truth value of Sentence 1. - If we consider the given scenario and assume that Sentence 1 is true, then it means the speaker indeed recommends waiting for the thing in question to come out on videotape. Step 2: Compare the content of both sentences. - Both sentences focus on the same action: \\"waiting for something to come out on video.\\" Step 3: Determine the truth value of Sentence 2. - Given that both sentences suggest waiting for something on video, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 should be true as well. The only difference in phrasing is videotape vs video, which can be interpreted to represent the same idea in this context. Conclusion: If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

To do this, we'll perform a primality test. Since the square root of 16927 is approximately 130.1, we only need to check the divisors from 2 to 130.

Read this: The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, include two of the most successful animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids.

Some of the notable animals in Annelida include: 1. Earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) - These are common terrestrial annelids that help in breaking down organic matter and aerating the soil. 2. Leeches (Hirudo medicinalis) - These are freshwater and terrestrial annelids that are known for their ability to feed on blood from other animals. They have been used historically for medicinal purposes, such as bloodletting. 3. Polychaetes (Nereis spp.) - Polychaetes are marine annelids that can be found in various marine environments including sandy shores, coral reefs, and deep-sea environments. They have a well-developed head region complete with eyes, antennae, and sensory structures called palps. 4.

The idea of healthcare reform had been a long-standing goal within the Democratic Party, with previous attempts dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and later President Harry S. Truman. The most recent serious attempt at reform took place under President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s, but his proposal, led by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, ultimately failed to pass due to political opposition. After his election in 2008, President Barack Obama made healthcare reform a top priority for his administration. He appointed key personnel within his administration who would play crucial roles in shaping the ACA, such as Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services and Nancy-Ann DeParle as Director of the White House Office of Health Reform. The legislation itself was primarily drafted by congressional Democrats, including the late Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Henry Waxman, with input from health policy experts, interest groups, and stakeholders. The ACA was heavily influenced by the Massachusetts health care reform law, which was enacted in 2006 under then-Governor Mitt Romney. Many of the ACA's key provisions, such as the individual mandate and the establishment of health insurance exchanges, were borrowed from the Massachusetts model. The Obama administration also sought input from conservative-leaning policy experts and organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation, in the hopes of achieving bipartisan support for the legislation. Throughout the crafting and debate of the ACA, President Obama and his administration worked with various stakeholders, such as insurance companies, hospitals, and physician groups, in order to address their concerns and gain their support for the legislation. He also held numerous public events and speeches to promote and explain his vision for healthcare reform to the American people. Despite efforts to reach bipartisan consensus, the process of passing the ACA in Congress was highly partisan, with no Republicans voting in favor of the bill. After a lengthy and contentious debate, the House of Representatives passed the ACA on March 21, 2010, and it was signed into law by President Obama two days later. In summary, while numerous individuals, organizations, and political figures contributed to the development and passage of the Affordable Care Act, its primary architects were President Barack Obama and key members of his administration, working in collaboration with congressional Democrats and various stakeholders within the healthcare industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Mobu tried to bring back to life? Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. Answer:","completion":"Bernie Lomax"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Article: Whether you were the shy one at high school or the most popular person on campus, starting university is a clean paper for everyone. It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met. Remember, be polite but firm. The key is to set expectations and clear boundaries from the beginning. Let your roommates know your life habits, but also observe and respect...

McCarthy Answer:","completion":"Title: Secrets in Shadows Synopsis: Secrets in Shadows is a gripping mystery drama set in the small town of McCarthy, Alaska, where nothing is as it seems. The film revolves around a series of mysterious events, unraveling buried secrets, deeply rooted betrayals, and twisted relationships, which all come to a head in a shocking climax. Plot: The story begins with Jessica Shaw, a budding journalist from New York, visiting McCarthy, Alaska, to spend a couple of months with her estranged aunt, Susan Turner. Jessica is seeking solace after the tragic death of her sister, Leah, and hopes to find peace while gathering information for a book she is working on about small-town life. Upon arrival in McCarthy, Jessica quickly realizes that the town is shrouded in mystery and whispers, with its less than welcoming townsfolk reluctant to share their stories. The town's economy primarily relies on tourism, hosting a goldmine that was once prosperous but now lies defunct, leaving some residents bitterly resentful. During her first week in McCarthy, Jessica stumbles upon a series of old newspaper clippings about a decades-old unsolved murder case. Intrigued, she decides to explore the story deeper and searches for people connected to the victim named Allison Turner, who was Susan's cousin and a prominent resident of McCarthy. Jessica interviews those who were close to Allison. Some individuals seem to have hazy memories of the case, while others are not willing to share any information. This silence fuels Jessica's curiosity, as she starts to delve deeper. After a few weeks, she finds a key witness who had kept quiet all these years, fearing for her life. Jessica gains her trust and discovers that the witness saw a shadowy figure the night Allison disappeared. Through her relentless investigation, Jessica soon uncovers that Allison was romantically involved with three men before her death, which led to a love triangle that escalated to jealousy, betrayal, and finally murder. As she continues to unravel the twisted relationships, she encounters some dangerous red herrings and finds herself too close for comfort to the killer. Parallelly, Jessica's relationship with her aunt Susan unfolds as Susan shares her own story about the family's dark past, revealing secrets untold. Jessica learns that her mother had left McCarthy and cut ties with Susan years ago, partially due to the fallout surrounding Allison's murder. As Jessica becomes more entwined with McCarthy's residents, she finds allies in Jason, the local bartender with a troubled past and Natalie, a young nurse with a bright outlook on life. Together, they work to exhume the buried history, confront the truth, and determine what really happened to Allison Turner on that fateful night. Confrontations occur between the suspects, their secrets are exposed, and the town of McCarthy is forced to confront its own dark past. As Jessica closes in on the truth, the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place, culminating in a heart-stopping revelation that alters the lives of all involved in Secrets in Shadows. Throughout the film, the beauty of Alaska provides a contrasting backdrop to the darkness hidden within the town. The movie explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the the strength of family bonds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: The Red Shoes Movie plot: Based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale about a pair of enchanted crimson ballet slippers, 'The Red Shoes' follows the beautiful Vicky Page (Moira Shearer), a young socialite who loves ballet, the rising composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) whom she loves, and her dictatorial director, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook).After attracting the attention of the famous Director, and earning respect and admiration from her colleagues, Vicky is promised by Lermontov that- ''You shall dance, and the world shall follow'' -but only on the agreement that she will dance, and he will control everything else.On this basis, Vicky rises to fame as the prima ballerina in a world- class Ballet Company. However, Lermontov discovers the romance between his talented composer and his beautiful protege, and he cruelly dictates that Vicky must give up Julian or the dancing. He is shocked, and hurt when she marries Julian, and leaves the company, but remains convinced that she will return to him.Vicky does miss her dancing, and when she is offered the chance to dance 'The Red Shoes' show once more, she attempts to resist, but eventually gives in to Lermontov's alternate bullying and coaxing. Julian is in London, preparing for the premiere of his new work 'Cupid and Psyche', and discovers that his wife has been coaxed back into dancing with the Lermontov Ballet. He is furious, as it appears that Lermontov has convinced her to leave him, and chases after her, arriving as she prepares to dance 'The Red Shoes' ballet, dishevelled and disbelieving in her dressing room shortly before the performance. She explains that she has missed her dancing, and embraces him, trying to convey wordlessly that she did not want to leave him, but Lermontov enters, and crows his victory over Julian, reinforcing Vicky's apparent betrayal until Julian gives an ultimatum, dancing or their marriage.Vicky is so distressed at the rapidly escalating tension and the competition between the crucial two men in her life that she can only cry broken... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Red Shoes,\\" Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) is a renowned and highly demanding ballet director who plays a significant role in the life of the protagonist, Vicky Page (Moira Shearer). Lermontov discovers Vicky's talent and becomes her mentor, propelling her to stardom as a prima ballerina under his guidance and direction. Lermontov's relationship with Vicky is complex, as he serves not only as her mentor and director but also as a controlling figure in her life. From the outset, it is clear that Lermontov is captivated by Vicky's passion and talent for ballet, and he wants to mold her into the ultimate ballet dancer. In return, he promises her great stardom, stating, \\"You shall dance, and the world shall follow.\\" However, this comes with the condition that she will focus solely on her dance career and allow him full authority over her life. This is the foundation of their intricate relationship. As the movie progresses, Lermontov's feelings toward Vicky seem to border on obsession. He is not only focused on her growth as a dancer but also deeply invested in controlling her personal life. This becomes evident through his disapproval and interference in her relationship with composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring). When Lermontov learns that his protégé and the young composer are in love, he becomes jealous and demands that she choose between dancing and her love for Julian. Despite Lermontov's attempts to control Vicky, she chooses to marry Julian and leave the ballet company, much to Lermontov's dismay. Nonetheless, the pull of her love for dancing remains strong. When she is eventually persuaded to return to the stage and perform in \\"The Red Shoes\\" ballet once again, it is Lermontov who takes advantage of the situation, using a mixture of coercion and persuasion to lure her back. As Vicky struggles to balance her love for ballet and her marriage, the tension between her, Lermontov, and Julian reaches a breaking point. Lermontov's controlling nature and insistence that Vicky dedicate her entire life to her art leads to a tragic conclusion, highlighting the power struggle between the three central characters in the film. In essence, Lermontov is a dominant figure in Vicky's life. He serves as her mentor, director, and, to a significant extent, her tormentor. He demonstrates a relentless drive to control her life both on and off the stage, ultimately pushing Vicky to her breaking point due to the conflicting demands of her dancing career and her personal life. The relationship between Lermontov and Vicky is complex and multi-faceted, illustrating themes of obsession, control, and the potentially destructive nature of artistic ambition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: * no. * yes.","completion":"The status of black people in the Roman Empire: The Roman Empire, like many ancient societies, had a wide range of cultural diversity, including citizens and enslaved people from Africa. The Roman Empire was home to people from various ethnic backgrounds, including those from North Africa, Egypt, and other parts of the continent. While many of these people would not be considered \\"black\\" under modern definitions of race, there were certainly individuals of darker skin color residing in Rome. Generally, in the Roman Empire, race was not a major factor determining an individual's social status. Rather than using race as a determinant factor, the Roman Empire placed more emphasis on social class and citizenship status. People were typically divided into various social classes based on their wealth, influence, and political power. Slavery was common, and slaves were often considered the lowest social class, regardless of their ethnic background. It is important to note that people of African origin occupied all levels of society in the Roman Empire. They could be found as slaves, gladiators, soldiers, philosophers, or even Roman senators and emperors. For example, the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus, who ruled from 193 to 211 CE, was of African origin, born in what is present-day Libya. Regarding the Roman Empire's trade: The Roman Empire was known for its extensive trade networks that connected Europe, Africa, and Asia. The empire traded with various regions, engaging in the exchange of numerous goods, materials, and ideas. This trade network allowed Rome to assert its influence and contribute to the wealth and prosperity of the empire. Some of the primary goods traded within and beyond the Roman Empire were: 1. Metals, such as gold, silver, tin, copper, lead, and iron, which were mined in the empire and served as the basis for various industries, including weapons and coin production. 2. Textiles and garments made from materials such as wool, linen, and Egyptian cotton were widely traded along with dyes from the East, like Tyrian purple dye from Phoenicia. 3. Grain was a staple food of the Roman diet, and the empire imported vast quantities of grain, particularly from Egypt and North Africa. These imports ensured a stable food supply for the cities and the Roman military. 4. Luxury items, such as silk, spices, incense, and gems, were mainly imported from the East, with traders traversing long distances on the Silk Road and other trade routes connecting Rome to Arabia, India, and China. 5. Slaves were also traded within the Roman Empire, and enslaved people served various functions in Roman society, such as household servants, field workers, artisans, gladiators, and even entertainment. 6. Various finished products, like pottery, glass, and artworks, were also traded for their aesthetics or functionality. In conclusion, the two questions do not inquire about the same information. The first question discusses the status of black people in the Roman Empire, while the second question addresses the various goods and materials that were traded within and beyond the Roman Empire.

After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and fought their way to a point south of Sevastopol after a series of successful battles. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, ordered personally by Nicholas, was defeated by Omar Pasha. The front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides.

Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point.

But in a fresh development detectives said there is a specific person of interest they need to question. The lead is seen as solid enough to persuade the Home Office to grant the extra money which will extend the search until September. It means the investigation will continue past the 10th anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance in May. PA/GETTY Police investigating Madeleine's disappearance have identified a person they want to question She vanished from her bed in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz while her parents ate a meal nearby with friends just days before her fourth birthday in 2007. There is just one person who detectives want to speak to who was near to the area where Madeleine disappeared almost 10 years ago Insider Police said there is one individual they want to speak to who was in the same area of Portugal when she went missing. International intelligence agencies have been working together to find the “person of interest” who detectives believe may hold the key to solving the case. Had the information not been deemed a “solid live lead” then the £13million police investigation would have been wound up. PA Police have been given an extra £85,000 to follow up the crucial lead The Home Office last night confirmed that the Metropolitan Police had been awarded an extra £85,000 in operational costs for Operation Grange to continue. A Home Office spokesman said: “Following an application from the Metropolitan Police for special grant funding the Home Office has confirmed £85,000 in operational costs for Operation Grange for the period April 1 until September 2017. “As with all applications the resources required are reviewed regularly and careful consideration is given before any new funding is allocated.” Senior officers admit the investigation of the new lead is the “last throw of the dice” in their hunt. But the Met is taking the development so seriously that leading Whitehall officials are being briefed on its progress. An insider said: “There is just one person who detectives want to speak to who was near to the area where Madeleine disappeared almost 10 years ago. “An international search has been underway to find them.” GETTY The new funding means Operation Grange will continue until September 2017 Madeleine McCann: The search continues Fri, February 24, 2017 These are the various computer generated images of how Maddie might look now Play slideshow ph 1 of 14 Madeline McCann went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, in Portugal’s Algarve 9 years ago. Last night Policing Minister Brandon Lewis, who signed off the latest payment, said: “I am pleased to be able to support the British police who are trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Madeleine McCann and give some kind of closure and justice to her family.” At the height of Scotland Yard’s inquiries more than 30 detectives and support staff were working on Operation Grange based at Belgravia police station in central London. When the inquiry was in full swing a team of trained specialists carried out detailed searches of carefully chosen scrubland near where Madeleine was taken from the coastal holiday spot on May 3, 2007. Now Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who leads the small team, has the unenviable task of trying to make a breakthrough with limited resources and a ticking clock before the September cut-off date. Detectives are now confident the net is closing in on the key lead which is why an application was made to the Home Office for extra funding and a stay of execution for the investigation. Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry remain convinced their daughter could still be alive. PA Madeleine was taken from the coastal holiday spot on May 3, 2007 ||||| The extra funding has approved by Prime Minister Teresa May, who met the McCann’s several times in her former role as Home Secretary. The team of detectives searching for Madeleine was in September 2015 cut from 29 to four. Sir Bernard Hogan Howe said nearly a year ago that police had one more line of inquiry to close.

Article: An infographic describing the Deep Carbon Observatory's Carbon Mineral Challenge: A worldwide hunt for new carbon minerals. Credit: DCO/Josh Wood The hunt is on for Earth's undiscovered carbon minerals. Scientists, using statistical calculations, now know how many are out there. They even have some ideas about where to look. But to find them, they need the help of the world's mineral collecting community. The Carbon Mineral Challenge sets the stage for both professional and amateur mineral collectors to make their mark by discovering never-before described minerals. Why carbon minerals? Carbon is one of the most chemically diverse elements, and occurs in compounds with almost every element of the periodic table. Some carbon-containing minerals form ores, which are mined for metals such as iron, nickel, and copper. Carbon-bearing minerals can contain rare Earth elements, critical components of smart phones and tablets. Carbon also becomes coal and diamond. And, most importantly, without carbon, there is no life. Given the scientific value of potential new carbon-bearing mineral discoveries, the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) is challenging both amateur collectors and professional mineralogists around the world to find these rare specimens. DCO is a global community of multi-disciplinary scientists unlocking the inner secrets of Earth through investigations into life, energy, and the fundamentally unique chemistry of carbon. A key goal of DCO is to identify the forms of carbon in Earth. Any new carbon minerals discovered as part of the Carbon Mineral Challenge will address this important scientific question, and add to our growing understanding of Earth's unique chemical makeup. Earth is the only known planet that supports life. Life on Earth has interacted with rocks over billions of years, generating a telltale geobiological footprint. Such a footprint should be visible on other life-supporting planetary bodies. \\"Figuring out the mineral signature of a life-supporting planet is a really exciting prospect,\\" says Robert Hazen, Senior Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, USA and Executive Director of the Deep Carbon Observatory. \\"Without life, fewer than a third of the different kinds of minerals we see on Earth would exist. Our new projections will inform planetary investigations, with probes tuned to detect mineralogical signs of life.\\" Rhodochrosite is a carbonate mineral first described in 1813.

Credit: Smithsonian Digital Studios How many are out there? Today, mineralogists recognize 406 carbon minerals out of more than 5000 known mineral species on Earth. Since 2010, the International Mineralogical Association has reported the discovery of an average of about four new carbon minerals every year for the past five years. However, DCO researchers now estimate there are at least 145 more carbon minerals still awaiting discovery. The video will load shortly Hazen and his colleagues, including mathematician Grethe Hystad of Purdue University Calumet, used a type of analysis called Large Number of Rare Events (LNRE) modeling to formulate this prediction, and will share the work in American Mineralogist in early 2016 (a preprint is available here) as well as during the Friday morning poster session at the 2015 AGU Fall Meeting (V51C-3039) and -3040. \\"Imagine reading a book,\\" says DCO's Hazen. \\"Some words you read over and over throughout, such as 'and' and 'the.' These common words are everywhere and easy to spot. On the other hand, there are words that may appear only one or two times in an entire book. Earth's missing minerals are like these rare words; we haven't found them yet because they formed only in very few places and in very small quantities.\\" The LNRE model also predicts that the majority of the carbon-bearing minerals awaiting discovery are hydrous carbonates, a potentially challenging fact for collectors. Where are these undiscovered minerals and what do they look like? Hazen's team predicts finding missing carbon minerals will challenge even the most dedicated mineral collectors. To have remained hidden for so long, these minerals must reside in remote localities and in small quantities. In some cases the minerals are likely ephemeral in nature. Many of the carbon species on Hazen's list, including hydrous carbonates, are potentially colorless, poorly crystalized, or easily dissolved in water. While Hazen and colleagues have not identified a treasure map for finding the missing carbon minerals, there are some potentially rewarding localities to consider. These include the Poudrette Quarry in Canada, Kukisvumchorr Mountain in Russia, and Clara Mine in Germany, where collectors have already found a diverse array of carbon minerals. \\"There's something magical about mineral collecting that's hard to put into words,\\" said Hazen's colleague and DCO early career scientist Daniel Hummer. \\"You're collecting fundamental constituents of the natural world that only exist because life has interacted with rocks over millions, or even billions, of years.\\" \\"One of the most exciting prospects,\\" Hummer continues, \\"is we might even stumble upon minerals we didn't predict in our analyses. We could be in for a surprise!\\" Used the world over in pencils, graphite is a mineral of pure carbon. The United States Geological Survey estimates over a million tons of graphite are currently mined every year around the world.

Amateur and professional mineral collectors should follow the procedures outlined by the International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification. Once the commission has approved the new mineral, the team responsible for its discovery and verification should submit their entry to the Carbon Mineral Challenge via mineralchallenge.net. Interested collectors may contact Carbon Mineral Challenge International Advisory Board members in their region with questions about mineral analysis and verification. Mineralchallenge.net also contains comprehensive guidelines, useful links, a photo gallery of known carbon minerals, and a list of FAQs for potential participants. The Carbon Mineral Challenge will continue until September 2019. DCO will publicly recognize each discovery as it happens and celebrate the final suite of newly discovered carbon minerals at the culmination of its decadal program in late 2019. The Carbon Mineral Challenge shines a light on a very specific, but important, subset of minerals. Over the next four years, and with each new discovery, a new piece of Earth's mineralogical puzzle will fall into place.

According to a new predictive model, more than 140 carbon mineral species on Earth have yet to be discovered, and DCO scientists have launched a citizen science project called the Carbon Mineral Challenge to find them. Over the next four years, teams around the world will study samples of carbon minerals submitted not only by academic mineralogists, but by amateur collectors and explorers. Got some unusual-looking minerals you’ve collected and stored in your garage? Head to the Carbon Mineral Challenge’s website to see whether they might be worth scrutinizing, says Robert Hazen at the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory and executive director of DCO. As an institution devoted to exploring carbon’s role on a planetary scale, DCO has a particular interest in carbon minerals. Carbon plays a role in all of Earth’s biology and in fundamental processes from the atmosphere to Earth’s core. The discovery of new carbon mineral species could also add immeasurably to research on materials, energy, and climate. “The chemistry of carbon tells us a lot about the chemistry of Earth,” Hazen says. Most of the mineral species we know of have been found serendipitously—a large number of those by amateur mineralogists. Hazen and his colleagues recently developed a method that combines the distributions and locations of known minerals with statistical methods used in biology and lexicography to predict the number of unknown carbon minerals on Earth. Scientists have catalogued 5,027 mineral species, of which 406 contain carbon. The new analysis, currently in press in American Mineralogist, predicts that there are still about 145 carbon mineral species left for the finding. Hazen and his colleagues announced the program, which is partly funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, on Dec. 17 at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. International teams of mineralogists are ready to vet promising candidates, determining compositions with electron microprobe analysis and crystal structures via X-ray crystallography. “It will be fascinating to see what new and exciting carbon minerals might be lurking in our Smithsonian collection drawers,” says Jeffrey E. Post, chair of the mineral sciences department and curator of the National Gem & Mineral Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. “And what impact they might have on understanding our planet.” This article is reproduced with permission from Chemical & Engineering News (© American Chemical Society).

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear.

Please answer the following question: Article: One is never too old to learn. Life learning (sometimes called un-schooling or self-directed learning) is one of those concepts that are almost easier to explain by saying what it isn't than what it is. And that's probably because our own schooled backgrounds have convinced us that learning happens only in a fine building on certain days, between certain hours, and managed by a specially trained professional. Within that schooling framestudy, no matter how hard teachers try and no matter how good their textbooks, many bright students get bored, many slower students struggle and give up or lose their self-respect, and most of them reach the end of the process unprepared to enter into society. They have memorized a certain body of knowledge long enough to rush back the information on tests, but they haven't really learnt much, at least of the official curriculum. Life learners, on the other hand, know that learning is not difficult, that people learn things quite easily if they're not compelled and forced, if they see a need to learn something, and if they are trusted and respected enough to learn it on their own timetable, at their own speed, in their own way--no matter what age and no matter whether we're at school or at home. Life learning is independent of time, location or the presence of teacher. It does not require mom or dad to teach, or kids to work in workbooks at the table from 9 to noon. Life learning is learner-driven. It involves living and learning--in and from the real world. It is about exploring, questioning, experimenting, making messes, taking risks without fear of making mistakes, being laughed at and trying again. Furthermore, life learning is about trusting kids to learn what they need to know and about helping them to learn and grow in their own ways.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the last names of the two people who agreed to a joint command? ? Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Plot title: The Great Ziegfeld Movie plot: Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. was born to an upper-middle class family in the late 19th century. From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines.

Hint: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision).

I'm positive about what I saw.\\" My mom looked at me skeptically, raising an eyebrow. \\"Alright then, enlighten me. What exactly did you see?\\" I took a deep breath, recalling the image of the creature in my mind. \\"It had a massive wingspan, and it moved so gracefully. The wings had a stark, almost shimmering quality to them, not like just any bird. Its body was covered in some kind of fur or thick hair, which made the creature appear almost ethereal. The colors on its body seemed to blend seamlessly into the surroundings, making it difficult to see clearly. And its eyes... there was just something about them. They seemed intelligent, almost as if it was studying me as much as I was studying it.\\" My mom's skepticism began to wane as she started to listen intently to the details of my description. \\"That does sound... unusual. And you're sure it wasn't just a trick of the light, or your imagination playing tricks on you?\\" I nodded, conviction in my voice. \\"I'm certain, mom. I've never seen anything like it before. It was definitely not just a bird.\\" As we stood there, contemplating the strange creature I had encountered, we both felt a sense of wonder and uncertainty. Despite my mom's skepticism, the detailed description and my unwavering conviction had left an impression on her. \\"Perhaps it was a cryptid, a creature not yet identified by science,\\" I suggested. \\"Or maybe it was an animal that used to be considered extinct, like the Coelacanth. It could have been living in the dense forest, hidden away from human eyes for who knows how long.\\" The possibility sent shivers down our spines, as we pondered the implications of such a discovery. We were torn between wanting to investigate further and the fear of what we might find if we dared to venture deeper into the forest in search of the creature. Finally, my mom hesitantly agreed that, regardless of what the creature was, it was worth attempting to further investigate and document its existence. We decided to make a plan and gather necessary equipment like cameras, binoculars, and camouflaged clothing to maximize our chances of coming across the creature again. Over the next several weeks, we dedicated our free time to searching for any sign of the mysterious creature. We spoke to locals to see if any of them had had a similar encounter, and much to our surprise, some people had indeed seen or heard of strange sightings in the area. This only bolstered our resolve to find concrete evidence of the enigmatic creature. During one of our expeditions deep into the forest, we stumbled upon a patch of terrain that seemed out of the ordinary. The ground appeared to be covered in some sort of track, and though it was difficult to discern a specific shape, the sheer size of the indentations was enough to give us a strong suspicion that our creature had passed through the area. Over time, our backyard adventures began to turn into serious and systematic research projects. We studied the local flora and fauna, and documented any unusual or unexplained phenomena. We reached out to experts in the fields of zoology, biology, and cryptozoology, who took a keen interest in our findings and offered valuable input and guidance. As the weeks turned into months, our hunt for the elusive creature continued. Though we hadn't encountered the creature again, our determination only grew stronger. We knew that the answers - and perhaps a new, groundbreaking discovery - lay just beyond our grasp. And we were willing to do whatever it took to unveil the truth hidden among the trees. In the end, our relentless search led us to the realm of cryptozoology and the exciting world of undiscovered species and hidden natural secrets. Regardless of what the creature was - be it a cryptid, an extinct species, or even just a bird - the journey of discovery sparked a passion for exploration and a newfound appreciation for the wonders of the world around us. And that, in itself, was a treasure worth seeking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - Belarus ( lat.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries.

(A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(B). it is not possible to tell While the premise \\"Do you want to say how much?\\" does suggest a request for information from the person who is asked, it is not necessarily inclusive of all types of information. \\"Do you want to say how much?\\" is a specific question that prompts the individual to provide a quantitative response or a measure. It could be about any matter that requires a numerical or measurable answer, for instance, the cost of an item, the quantity of goods, the amount of time spent on an activity, and so on. Contrarily, the hypothesis \\"Do you want to give any information?\\" is a more general question that might encompass any form of data or details, regardless of type or topic. This question does not restrict the response to a numerical or measurable one. It could be qualitative or descriptive information, opinions, facts, or any other form of knowledge. So, while both questions are indeed seeking information, they are not interchangeable due to their specificity or general nature. It is impossible to accurately determine if the hypothesis \\"Do you want to give any information?\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"Do you want to say how much?\\" because they do not inquire about the same type of information. On the other hand, if someone answers 'yes' to the premise, it does imply a willingness to give some information, albeit specific. However, if the answer is 'no', it doesn't mean the person is unwilling to provide any information; they might be more comfortable or willing to share different information.

The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 13:01 EST, 16 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:14 EST, 16 July 2013. A reporter who had an affair with Dateline NBC star Chris Hansen has spoken out about what she says is a double standard against women in broadcast media. The outburst comes as 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell released photographs allegedly showing her kissing Hansen, who had previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies'. Miss Caddell claims that she has not been able to find work since their four-month affair was revealed, while Hansen has continued unscathed by the scandal, according to RadarOnline. Caught on camera: Kristyn Caddell says this photo, allegedly showing Chris Hansen and her kissing, proves their relationship. The reporter said she had worked at three stations since the affair was revealed in 2011, but claims she was unable to hold down a job because of the stigma of the relationship. 'No matter what your philosophy is. on someone who has an affair, if it was the man or the woman’s fault,. there are two people involved and if I can’t work, he should not be able. to work,' Miss Caddell told RadarOnline. 'I have lived the double standard,' she. added. 'A double standard is an understatement as to what happens in. this industry. The women get fired and the men keep going.' Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV. She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date. 'I believed him with my heart,' Miss Caddell, who is not married and does not have children, said. 'You can say I was naive, as it was. That was my biggest crime, being naive ... I make one personal mistake and I am [considered] a worthless human being.' Ruined: Kristyn Caddell claims she has been turned down by news networks because of the affair. Denial: When the National Enquirer first revealed the affair, Chris Hansen said the pair were just friends. Hansen, a father who is best known for his show To Catch a Predator, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner. 'I understand the perceived irony of. the, you know, so-called \\"gotcha guy\\" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the \\"gotcha guy\\" got gotcha-ed. doing was going out to dinner.' The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment. However, in images Miss Caddell has just released, Hansen is shown kissing her. She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it. 'Chris was flying me all over the. country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling. with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in. public places ... Chris. gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I. trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month. Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her. 'For the past two. years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say. anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep. trying to get jobs. “But we. are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an. employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation. involving Chris Hansen.' She added: “I. thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in. my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and. my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of. that.' Dreams shattered: Kristyn Caddell says the scandal has ruined her career as a news reporter. The reporter added that she had struggled to break into journalism, and just before the affair, had finally felt like her career was taking off. 'Then, to essentially get taken down, because of a man, who has a lot of money and a lot of fame, it is not a good feeling. That is what happened to me,' she said. Hansen has previously claimed the pair were no more than friends, according to Fox News.

The article includes a photo of Caddell and Hansen allegedly kissing, which she released to prove their relationship.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide specific information on the duration of the alleged affair between President Trump and the adult film star. The claim made by the adult film star was that she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but it does not detail whether this was a one-time event or a longer-lasting relationship. Consequently, any conclusion about the duration of the affair would be speculative based on the information provided in the text. As mentioned in the text, President Trump has denied that the tryst ever occurred."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\".

The word \\"tragedy\\" implies that the situation being discussed or referred to is deeply unfortunate, unhappy, or disastrous in nature. This further suggests that the speaker is expressing their emotions or thoughts about an event or occurrence that has caused them or others distress, pain, or suffering. Various factors, including context, tone, and facial expressions of the speaker, can influence the sentiment's intensity and the nuances of the emotion that it conveys. For example, a more solemn tone could cause the sentiment to be perceived as stronger and more profound, revealing a deep sense of sadness and grief. In contrast, a lighter tone could make the sentiment seem less severe, implying a more moderate level of disappointment or sorrow. Additionally, the context in which the sentence is used can shape how the sentiment is understood. If the sentence is spoken or written in response to something like the recent death of a loved one, the sentiment will likely be perceived as profoundly sad and compassionate. On the other hand, if the sentence is used to describe a less severe event, such as a canceled trip or a lost item, the sentiment may carry a slightly different emotional weight, leaning towards disappointment and inconvenience. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"such a tragedy\\" is generally perceived as negative, reflecting emotions such as sadness, empathy, and disappointment. The intensity and specific nuances of the sentiment can vary based on factors like tone, context, and the speaker's expressions, highlighting the importance of considering these aspects when interpreting and responding to the statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret.

The reason is that the premise and the hypothesis are not logically connected. Thus, the truth of the premise has no bearing on the validity of the hypothesis. The premise states that every time the person runs their VCR while they are at work, they record a particular talk show and watch it every evening when they come home. The focus of the premise is about the person's tendency to watch a specific talk show and does not touch on their presence or absence at home in the evenings. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the person does not come home in the evenings. This assertion does not have any relation to the premise. Since the premise focuses solely on watching the talk show in the evening, it leaves open the possibility that there are other evenings when the person does not watch the talk show or indeed doesn't come home. Nevertheless, there is no logical connection that can be established between the premise and the hypothesis, so the truth of the premise cannot confirm the validity of the hypothesis. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, more information is needed about the person's daily routine, work schedule, and habits.

In 2015, the singer’s legal team warned the then-Republican presidential candidate over his use of “Dream On” on the campaign trail. Three years later, a Trump rally Tuesday at West Virginia’s Charleston Civic Center featured Aerosmith’s 1993 hit “Livin’ on the Edge,” resulting in another cease-and-desist letter from Tyler, Variety reports. “By using ‘Livin’ On The Edge’ without our client’s permission, Mr. Trump is falsely implying that our client, once again, endorses his campaign and/or his presidency, as evidenced by actual confusion seen from the reactions of our client’s fans all over social media,” the cease-and-desist letter stated. “This specifically violates Section 43 of the Lanham Act, as it ‘is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person.'” The letter also notes that Trump’s team has ignored the previous cease-and-desist from 2015, making this latest violation a “willful infringement. “What makes this violation even more egregious is that Mr. Trump’s use of our client’s music was previously shut down, not once, but two times, during his campaign for presidency in 2015,” the letter continued.

Like in 2015, it is Tyler – and not Aerosmith – taking legal action against Trump: Both Perry and drummer Joey Kramer are avowed Republicans, with Kramer especially vocal about his support from Trump. On Monday, the night before the West Virginia rally, Aerosmith performed alongside Post Malone at the MTV Video Music Awards. The band will begin a Las Vegas residency in April 2019. ||||| Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler is demanding President Donald Trump stop using the band’s songs at rallies, like the one held at the Charleston Civic Center in West Virginia on Tuesday (August 21). The band’s 1993 hit “Livin’ on the Edge” was played as Trump devotees entered the venue, which has a capacity of 13,500. Tyler has in turn sent a “cease and desist” letter through his attorney Dina LaPolt to the White House accusing the President of willful infringement in broadcasting the song, which was written by Tyler, Joe Perry and Mark Hudson. Citing the Lanham Act, which prohibits “any false designation or misleading description or representation of fact … likely to cause confusion … as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person,” Tyler’s attorney contends that playing an Aerosmith song in a public arena gives the false impression that Tyler is endorsing Trump’s presidency. The matter has come up previously with another Aerosmith song, “Dream On,” which Trump used during his 2015 election campaign. Following a similar letter stating, “Trump for President needs our client’s express written permission in order to use his music” and that the campaign “was violating Mr. Tyler’s copyright,” BMI drove the point home and pulled the public performance rights for the song. Public performance rights for “Livin’ on the Edge” are administered by ASCAP. The scene in WV before Trump’s rally. Aerosmith’s “Livin’ on the edge” playing. pic.twitter.com/HW1qr9TBgE — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 21, 2018 During the rally, President Trump spoke about immigration, trade and politics, peppered with his usual banter about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Earlier in the day, Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts in federal court on Tuesday, including campaign finance violations related to payments made to women who claim to have had affairs with Trump. Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was also found guilty Tuesday on eight of 18 counts in his federal trial over fraud charges. The case involved work Manafort did on behalf of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. Shortly after the verdicts were announced, President Trump told reporters: “I feel badly for Paul Manafort” and called him “a good man.” On Sunday, Aerosmith was among the top-billed acts on the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, joining Post Malone and 21 Savage for the show’s closing performance, a medley of “Dream On” and “Toys in the Attic.” Read portions of Tyler’s letter to the White House below: It has come to our attention that President Donald J. Trump and/or The Trump Organization (collectively, “Mr. Trump”) have been using our client’s song “Livin’ On The Edge” in connection with political rally events (the Rallies”), including at an event held yesterday at the Charleston Civic Center in Charleston, West Virginia on August 21, 2018. As expressly outlined in the Previous Letters, Mr. Trump does not have our client’s permission to use any of our client’s music, including “Livin’ On The Edge”. What makes this violation even more egregious is that Mr. Trump’s use of our client’s music was previously shut down, not once, but two times, during his campaign for presidency in 2015. Please see the Previous Letters sent on behalf of our client attached here as Exhibit A. Due to your receipt of the Previous Letters, such conduct is clearly willful, subjecting Mr. Trump to the maximum penalty under the law. As we have made clear numerous times, Mr. Trump is creating the false impression that our client has given his consent for the use of his music, and even that he endorses the presidency of Mr. Trump. By using “Livin’ On The Edge” without our client’s permission, Mr. Trump is falsely implying that our client, once again, endorses his campaign and/or his presidency, as evidenced by actual confusion seen from the reactions of our client’s fans all over social media. This specifically violates Section 43 of the Lanham Act, as it “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person.” Further, as we have also made clear, Mr. Trump needs our client’s express written permission in order to use his music. We demanded Mr. Tyler’s public performance societies terminate their licenses with you in 2015 in connection with “Dream On” and any other musical compositions written or co-written by Mr. Tyler. As such, we are unaware of any remaining public performance license still in existence which grants Mr. Trump the right use his music in connection with the Rallies or any other purpose. If Mr. Trump has any such license, please forward it to our attention immediately. In addition, Mr. Tyler’s voice is easily recognizable and central to his identity, and any use thereof wrongfully misappropriates his rights of publicity. Mr. Trump does not have any right to use the name, image, voice or likeness of our client, without his express written permission.

Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"Bishop Andrew de Moravia"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With several trials attempting to deep-fry chicken, the results were unsatisfactory.

The girl sounded worse when she sang slow songs than fast ones. Her voice went worse with","completion":"each passing note, making her frustration increasingly palpable. It was no secret that she had a penchant for energetic tunes, but her lack of finesse when it came to slower melodies was proving to be an obstacle in her journey as a budding singer. The dreamy, mellifluous cadence of slow songs had always eluded her, resulting in a warbling, uneven sound. Each attempt seemed to fray her nerves, leaving her crestfallen. There was a stark contrast between her animated, exuberant renditions of fast songs, filled with soaring high notes and smoldering passion, and her listless, unstable performances of slow ballads. Puzzled and disheartened, the girl reached out to a vocal coach for guidance. Coach Elina, a seasoned singer known for her versatility and nuanced understanding of diverse musical genres, agreed to take the girl under her wing. During their initial session together, Elina probed the girl's technique and assessed her vocal abilities. With a discerning ear, she identified the root cause of the girl's plight: breath control. The girl's rapid, shallow breathing was incompatible with the demands of slow songs, resulting in a shaky and wavering voice. In contrast, her breathing was perfectly suited for the upbeat pace of fast songs. To remedy the issue, Elina explained the importance of proper breath support and taught the girl breathing techniques honed through decades of vocal instruction. They began with diaphragmatic breathing exercises, followed by elongated exhales and breath management techniques. Each lesson focused on refining the girl's breathing abilities, regulating her airflow, and incorporating this into her singing. Slowly but surely, the girl's slow song performances began to transform. Under Elina's watchful eye, she learned to harness the power of her breath – her once-tremulous voice gained stability, added richness, and bloomed with nuanced emotion. Over weeks and months of relentless practice, the girl achieved progress that she had once deemed unattainable. But Elina knew that a well-rounded singer needed more than skillful breath control. Sensing the girl's sensitivity towards emotions, she coached her on the art of storytelling through music. Songs were no longer just melodious words; they became a means of conveying the deepest human emotions. The girl gradually learned to tap into her raw vulnerability, to breathe life into the lyrics and bring the story to the forefront. As the girl's capacity to captivate her audience burgeoned, so did her confidence. Her newfound control over her breathing and an innate ability to convey the songs' sentiments carved a unique signature style—toe-curlingly beautiful and emotionally evocative. The experts marveled at her metamorphosis, while the listeners reveled in the emotive power of her voice. In time, the girl became known for her soul-stirring renditions of slow songs as much as her effervescent performances of fast ones. Her dedication, persistence, and openness to learning had allowed her to overcome a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, forging her into a versatile artist capable of effortlessly capturing the hearts of her audience. And so, the girl who once sounded worse when she sang slow songs than fast ones had blossomed into a singer with a voice that captured the essence of both joy and sorrow with equal skill. Her journey serves as a testament to the transformative power of dedication, passion, and mentorship, and her story continues to inspire those who seek mastery over their art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Which of the following was not characteristic of music of the Romantic era: an extended melodic line, emotional elements, or Classical era forms? Context: The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.

Jack has a wife, Maria (Briony Glassco), and three kids, Joanne (Anna Maguire), Julia (Holly Boyd), and Andrew (Joel Pitts). Jack subtly hijacks the family vacation, changing it from a lazy week of Mediterranean fun and sun in Corfu, Greece, to a tour of India, because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed as the kids are.Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously seize a plum reporting assignment and spend at least a smidgen of quality time with his family. But, on the way to India, their plane, a Boeing 747-200 owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in Limassol, Cyprus, because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the planeâwhich is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a Serbian man named Ivanic Loyvek (Serge Soric) and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic (Ivan Marevich). And they are demanding 50,000,000 from the U.S. State Department in one hour or everyone on the airplane will die.The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last. But as soon as a front passenger door is opened, a local police team gunning for the terrorists opens fire. The flight attendants frantically open the rest of the airplane's doors and start getting passengers out, but the terrorists start killing passengers, leading to an explosion.Maria, Joanne, and Julia get out of the airplane, and then Jack, holding Andrew, gets outâonly to watch Maria, Joanne, and Julia get shot by the terrorists. Jack tries to hide Andrew's face so he can't see it. Maria and Joanne are dead, and Julia is still aliveâbut Julia burns to death while crying for help. In all, a total of 15 passengers die, and Loyvek and Maldic, the surviving terrorists, escape, knowing that they now have the 50,000,000. Jack feels that the hijacking would never have ended that way if the police team had waited until after the passengers were released from the airplane before getting trigger happy.Back in London, an absolutely devastated Jack is told that the terrorists were captured, but they were released and deported secretly, with no charges, no arrestâthe result of some awfully compromised politics. Jack is understandably enraged that Loyvek and Maldic got off scot-free. While helping Andrew cope, Jack tries all the legal ways to ensure justice for his family, but to no avail.Jack pays a visit to Henry Davidson (Jason Priestley), a CIA agent who works at the American Embassy in London. Davidson tells Jack that there's little that can be done. Obviously, the American and British governments are completely impotent when it comes to going after Loyvek and Maldic, so Jack must do it himself.With the help of his friend ex-intelligence operative Kate Stockton (Charlotte Rampling), who is well-schooled in the finer points of international intelligence, Jack becomes a one-man anti-terrorist squadron, tracking down those who work with Loyvek and Maldic, and turning their own weapons against them.

Article: Some of the most painful moments I spend as a vet ( ) are those spent with my customers assisting my animal patients from this world to the next. Making this final decision is not easy, and I have often felt powerless to comfort the sorrowful owners. That was before I met Shane. I had been called to examine a ten-year-old dog named Belker who had developed a serious health problem. The dog's owner--Ron, his wife, Lisa, and their little boy, Shane--were hoping for a miracle . But I told the family there were no miracles left for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia for the old dog in their home. As we made the arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for the four-year-old Shane to observe the euthanasia. They felt Shane could learn something from the experience. The next day, _ Shane seemed so calm, patting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. A few minutes later, Belker slipped peacefully away. The little boy seemed to accept Belker's death without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a little while after Belker's death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives. Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up: \\"I know why.\\" Shocked, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next astonished me. I'd never heard a more comforting explanation. He said, \\"Everybody is born so they can learn how to live a good life: like loving everybody and being nice, right?\\" The four-year-old continued, \\"Well, animals already know how to do that, so they don't have to stay as long.\\" Question: What would the author say about Shane?

Write highlights for this article: George W. Bush appeared to take aim at his successor President Obama in an interview aired today - as he suggested the draw down of troops in Iraq had allowed ISIS to flourish. Speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview, the 68-year-old former president said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' Scroll down for video. Former president: George W. Bush (pictured speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview that will air on Sunday) has only one regret about invading Iraq - that it paved the way for the rise of the Islamic State. Militant: Bush told correspondent Bob Schieffer: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated.' Above, an ISIS militant in Raqqa, Syria. During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer, Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein did not take him seriously. 'You know, when he was captured... I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him, he said \\"I just didn’t believe Bush,\\"' he said. 'And it’s hard for me to believe he didn’t believe me.' 'In retrospect…I don’t see how he could doubt my word,' Bush, who is currently promoting his new book, '41: A Portrait Of My Father', which is a biography of his father, George H.W. Bush, added. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, which spanned March 19 to May 1 that year, signaled the start of the Iraq War, which claimed the lives of nearly half a million people. Discussing the war: During the interview, the 68-year-old former president (pictured, right, with Schieffer), said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. After the invasion: Bush is pictured addressing the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. He declared major fighting over in Iraq, calling it 'one victory in a war on terror' Former Iraqi president: During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer, Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein (pictured) did not take him seriously. In December 2011, under the orders of President Barack Obama, all U.S. troops departed from Iraq, bringing the American mission in the war-torn country to an end. However, in the past few years, ISIS has quickly risen to power in Iraq and Syria, taking control of swathes of both countries. In June, the terror group overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Bush's two-part interview will air on CBS News's Sunday Morning at 9am on Sunday, as well as the channel's 'Face The Nation' at 10.30am the same day. 'Critically injured': On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) In the biography, Bush also reveals his father, now 90, seriously considered not running for re-election in 1992, even though he loved his job. This is because he felt his role was creating scrutiny of his son, Neil Bush, who was facing a federal lawsuit. 'It killed him to see Neil singled out because he was the President's son,' Bush wrote. The book also discusses George H.W. Bush's decision to launch the first war in Iraq in 1991, his early failures in politics and his stinging defeat to Bill Clinton in 1992.

Martín de Ursúa used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of Governor-General of the Philippines, which he took up in 1709. European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called \\"wild\\" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts. During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into debt peonage. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish. San José, on the northwest shore of lake Petén Itzá, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities.

Elimination of other options: The other options, such as \\"house,\\" \\"person,\\" \\"palace,\\" and \\"hospital,\\" are less likely to be the correct answer because they are not typically associated with educational settings or interaction between students and teachers. - \\"House\\" mostly refers to a residential setting, which isn't the primary place where children would gather at the request of teachers. - A \\"person\\" can't be a place where kids gather, as it represents a human being rather than a physical location. - \\"Palace\\" is a grand and luxurious residence, often associated with royalty or the wealthy, and is not a typical location for children to gather at the request of teachers. - \\"Hospital\\" is where children might gather for medical reasons, not at the request of teachers. Hence, considering all these factors, a human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question because it best fits the given information and context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time - and claims Celtic’s chances of reaching the League Cup Final are no more than 50/50. The Scottish champions moved three points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 victory over Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday, while Rangers, whose caretaker boss Kenny McDowall last week handed in his notice, remain mired in a boardroom crisis and trail Championship leaders Hearts by 13 points. Parkhead striker Anthony Stokes has admitted some fans won’t be satisfied unless Ronny Deila’s men rack up four or five goals against their beleaguered rivals at Hampden. Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time. But Celtic No 1 Gordon says talk of running up a cricket score is dangerous and misguided. He said: ‘We got by against Ross County with just one goal and that shows you can’t go into any game thinking about how many goals you’re going to score. ‘Is it a 50-50 game? They probably always are 50/50 games, regardless of who’s playing for the two sides. ‘Rangers still have enough quality in their team to win a game so we’ll be looking at ourselves and our preparation. Rangers manager Kenny McDowall, who has handed in his notice, during a training session. ‘The form book goes out the window in Celtic-Rangers matches. There are two sides with 11 men desperate to win the game. And when you have that, anything can happen. ‘You go out in any match intending to win your own individual battles and try to get a victory – whatever the scoreline.’ Former Sunderland and Hearts star Gordon knows the quality of the Rangers squad having spent time training at Murray Park during his long recovery from injury. The 32-year-old was involved in a public spat last November when ex-Rangers boss Ally McCoist claimed he had tried to sign him – a claim the keeper rejected. Celtic's Kris Commons celebrates his goal with team-mates during Saturday's win against Ross County. He also rejects the notion Celtic will be under enormous pressure on Sunday, given they are clear favourites. ‘I don’t feel there is added pressure on us. It’s not just experience Rangers have, but good, quality players, too. So we’ll have to be wary of that, as well as causing our own problems for them. ‘It’s a semi-final and it’s a massive match - but it would be massive regardless.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates going three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premier League. Meanwhile, Celtic boss Deila remained coy when asked about a link with Manchester United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher on Saturday. He said: ‘There’s nothing new in that matter. He has several [interested clubs] and it is best for me to wait to next Monday to see where we are.’ Celtic also been linked with a move for midfielder Kim Bo-Kyung. They missed out on the South Korea international when Malky Mackay brought him to Cardiff for £5million in 2012 but he has just been released by the Welsh side.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"These two questions do carry a similar meaning, with both emphasizing the hypothetical scenario in which Muslims never existed. However, the first question is more direct, while the second one is framed to ask about the consequences or implications of Muslims never having existed. To answer the question on this hypothetical scenario, we will take a look at various aspects of history, society, culture, and science that have been influenced by Muslims or the Islamic civilization. 1. Historical Impact One of the most significant Muslim contributions to history is the Islamic Golden Age, which lasted from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Many significant advances in science, philosophy, and art occurred during this time, which originated in the Middle East and later influenced other parts of the world. Without Muslims, the Islamic Golden Age would not have happened, which could have led to a delay or even discontinuity in the development of mathematics, natural sciences, philosophy, and literature. Moreover, the Islamic Empire would not have been established. This empire was one of the largest in history, stretching from Spain to northern India and Central Asia. Without the Muslim influence in these areas, the political landscape would have been very different in key historical periods, such as during the Crusades and the age of exploration. 2. Society and Culture Muslim culture and Islamic values greatly influenced art, poetry, music, and architecture. Many iconic buildings, such as the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, and the Great Mosque of Cordoba, would not have been constructed. The intricate Islamic geometric designs found in many art forms would also not exist without the Muslim influence. In addition to physical contributions, the Islamic world also made significant contributions to literature. Classic works like One Thousand and One Nights would not have been written or preserved. The world would also be devoid of renowned Muslim poets like Rumi and Hafez, whose works continue to inspire people across the globe. 3. Scientific and Technological Contributions The Islamic Golden Age saw major advancements in scientific fields, such as medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry. Without Muslims, great scholars like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), and Al-Khwarizmi, who developed the concept of algorithms in mathematics, might not have made such significant contributions. Pioneering medical texts, such as the Canon of Medicine by Avicenna, significantly impacted the study and practice of medicine globally. Similarly, the fields of optics, astronomy, and mechanical engineering benefited from the contributions of Muslim scholars like al-Haytham, al-Biruni, and Al-Jazari. 4. Religious Influence If Muslims did not exist, the religion of Islam would not have spread across the world. Today, Islam is the second-largest religion globally, with around 1.8 billion followers. Moreover, the world would not have experienced the encounter, dialogue, and exchange of ideas between Islam and other major world religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism, which helped shape the history of interreligious understanding and conflicts. In conclusion, if Muslims had never existed, the world would have been a very different place. From historical events to cultural, scientific, and technological advancements, the absence of Muslims would have dramatically altered the course of human history. While it is impossible to predict precisely the alternative outcomes that would have arisen without Muslim existence, it is clear that their contributions have had a significant and lasting impact on global society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years were between the Iroquois attacking the Neutral Nation, and having completely driven the trade from tradiitonal territory?","completion":"Title: The Iroquois-Neutral Nation Conflict: Years of Struggle and Transformation in Trading Territory Introduction The Iroquois Confederacy, a powerful and influential Indigenous group consisting of five tribes (Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca), played a significant role in the history of North America, particularly in the region that is now the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Among their many conflicts with neighboring Indigenous nations, the Iroquois conducted a series of brutal attacks against the Neutral Nation, culminating in the complete dissolution of the Neutral confederacy. This article delves into the timeline of events and analyzes the critical factors that led to this Iroquois victory and the shifting of trade from traditional Neutral territories. Timeline of Conflict The early 17th century was marked by the escalation of tension and violence among Indigenous nations in the Northeast. As European fur traders became increasingly involved in the region, trade networks shifted, and local nations often found themselves compelled to take sides in conflicts to protect their interests. 1. Early Interactions (1600-1639) The Iroquois initially established contact with the Neutral Nation around 1600. During the early years, interactions were primarily peaceful, with elaborate ceremony and exchange of goods and wampum. However, by the 1630s, the Iroquois and their Huron allies experienced several violent confrontations with the Neutrals. This conflict was fueled by competition for control of the lucrative fur trade and the desire to strengthen alliances with European powers. 2. Escalation of Conflict (1640-1649) Between 1640 and 1649, tensions between the Iroquois and Neutral Nation intensified. The Iroquois, seeking to expand their influence over the fur trade, began launching attacks on Neutral territories. The Iroquois also continued attacks against the Huron and other Indigenous communities, with whom the Neutrals had relations. The hostile acts perpetrated by the Iroquois during this period culminated in the virtual destruction of the Huron confederacy in 1649. 3. The Final Decade (1650-1659) The complete annihilation of the Neutral Nation occurred during the 1650s. After defeating the Huron, the Iroquois turned their attention to the remaining communities connected to the fur trade: the Neutral Nation, the Petun, and the Erie. In the early 1650s, the Iroquois launched a series of devastating attacks on Neutral villages, leading to the migration of thousands of Neutral people from their traditional territories. By the mid-1650s, the Iroquois had largely driven the Neutral Nation from their lands and into a state of permanent displacement. Conclusion In conclusion, there were approximately three stages in the years-long conflict between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Neutral Nation. The process to drive the Neutral Nation from their traditional territory and alter the regional trade dynamic took roughly 50 to 60 years, from the initial introduction in 1600 to the final phase of the conflict in the 1650s. While the exact timeline of events may vary depending on different historical sources, it remains true that by the mid-17th century, the Iroquois had effectively subdued the Neutral Nation – and with the conquest of other regional powers like the Huron and Erie, they emerged as the dominant force in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Now, I have a new situation: A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture. Answer this question please: Which village had a more dependable food supply?

Agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago. Step 3: Determine the village with agricultural knowledge. According to the information about the archaeologists' study, the inhabitants of Village Beta already knew about and practiced agriculture. Step 4: Consider the relationship between agriculture and food supply. The background mentions that the invention of agriculture provided a bigger, more dependable food supply.

Q:Information: - The Ediacaran Period, spans 94 million years from the end of the Cryogenian Period 635 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Cambrian Period 541 Mya. It marks the end of the Proterozoic Eon, and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. It is named after the Ediacara Hills of South Australia. - The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Chitin (CHON) is a long-chain polymer of an \\"N\\"-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulae of molluscs, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses and on the scales and other soft tissues of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved versatile for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes. - Perspicaris is a fossil arthropod from the Cambrian period . It was 2 -- 3 centimetres ( 0.8 -- 1.2 in ) long and bivalved . The valves , encasing the thorax , were joined together by a dorsal hinge . It is difficult to establish the lifestyle of Perspicaris . Its large eyes and other parts would suggest a swimming animal , yet it lacks claws , which seems to suggest a bottom feeder . Two species of Perspicaris are found in the famous Burgess Shale in British Columbia , Canada . 202 specimens of Perspicaris are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed , where they comprise 0.38 % of the community . - The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. Within the thymus, T cells or T lymphocytes mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum, in front of the heart and behind the sternum. Histologically, each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T-cells. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin (derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells). Developing T-cells are referred to as thymocytes and are of hematopoietic origin. Stromal cells include epithelial cells of the thymic cortex and medulla, and dendritic cells. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - The thorax or chest (from the Greek \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. - In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off a part of its body (often, but not always, an outer layer or covering), either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle. - Anatomy is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts. Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A Lagerstätte (from \\"Lager\\" 'storage, lair' \\"Stätte\\" 'place'; plural \\"Lagerstätten\\") is a sedimentary deposit that exhibits extraordinary fossils with exceptional preservationsometimes including preserved soft tissues. These formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an anoxic environment with minimal bacteria, thus delaying decomposition. \\"Lagerstätten\\" span geological time from the Neoproterozoic era to the present. Worldwide, some of the best examples of near-perfect fossilization are the Cambrian Maotianshan shales and Burgess Shale, the Devonian Hunsrück Slates and Gogo Formation, the Carboniferous Mazon Creek, the Jurassic Solnhofen limestone, and the Cretaceous Santana and Yixian formations. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - An exoskeleton (from Greek , \\"éx\\" \\"outer\\" and , \\"skeletos\\" \\"skeleton\\") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as \\"shells\\". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The neck is the part of the body, on many vertebrates, that separates the head from the torso or trunk. It contains blood vessels and nerves that supply structures in the head to the body. These in humans include part of the esophagus, the larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland, major blood vessels including the carotid arteries and jugular veins, and the first part of the spinal cord. - A body plan (also written bodyplan), Bauplan (German plural Baupläne), or ground plan is \\"an assemblage of morphological features shared among many members of a phylum-level group\\". The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla. - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who is responsible for choosing shows for the theatre?","completion":"The responsibility for choosing shows for a theatre typically lies with a team comprising of various professionals, each contributing their unique expertise and perspective to the selection process. While the specific composition of this team may vary depending on a theatre's size, organizational structure, and goals, there are several common roles that play a significant part in this decision-making process: 1. Artistic Director: Often regarded as the most influential figure in the selection process, the artistic director sets the creative vision for a theatre season. They have to consider various factors such as a theatre’s audience preferences, mission, financial goals, and available resources. The artistic director is responsible for ensuring that the selected plays align with the theatre's identity, while also providing innovative and engaging content that can attract and retain patrons. 2. Executive Director / General Manager: In some theatres, the executive director or general manager also plays a significant role in choosing the repertoire. This role is typically responsible for the overall management and financial success of the organization. It involves ensuring that the selected shows can be produced within budget, meet revenue expectations, and align with the theatre's operational goals. They work closely with the artistic director to strike a balance between artistic integrity and fiscal responsibility. 3. Literary Manager / Dramaturg: These roles involve assessing and analyzing potential scripts, researching the context and themes of the proposed plays, and advising the artistic director on the artistic merits and potential challenges associated with each script. A literary manager may also be responsible for preselecting scripts based on the theatre's submission criteria and guidelines or establishing relationships with playwrights, agents, and publishers to access new and unpublished works. 4. Production Team: The production team may include key members such as the production manager, technical director, chief designer, and marketing manager. This team contributes their insights about the practicalities and feasibility of producing various shows, offering their perspectives on aspects like set design, lighting, costume requirements, and marketing strategies. Their input can influence the selection process by highlighting the resources and capabilities required for a particular production. 5. Board of Directors / Committee: The Board of Directors or a designated committee within the theatre organization may be involved in approving and endorsing the final season choices. This group is generally responsible for the theatre's strategic direction, fundraising, and sustainability and ensures that the proposed season aligns with the theatre's long-term goals and objectives. They often rely on recommendations from the artistic director, executive director, and production team to make informed decisions. 6. Audience / Community Input: The theatre audience and the local community may indirectly influence the selection process through surveys, feedback sessions, or focus groups that capture their interests and preferences. Such input can help guide a theatre in selecting shows that cater to their patrons' tastes as well as identify emerging trends and new opportunities to broaden their appeal. In summary, the responsibility for choosing shows for the theatre falls to a collaborative group of professionals, each playing a critical role in evaluating the artistic, financial, and logistical aspects of potential productions. The process combines creative vision with pragmatic considerations, aiming to deliver diverse and captivating experiences for audiences while maintaining the theatre's financial stability, artistic integrity, and strategic objectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: BOSTON (Reuters) - The rising cost of higher education is dogging Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans, according to a federal report released on Wednesday. While the Government Accountability Office report noted that relatively few U.S. households headed by people 65 or over are carrying student loans, the value of the unpaid debt had spiked from 2.8 billion in 2005, before the financial crisis. That debt is concentrated in a small number of homes. Just 4 percent of households headed by someone 65 or older carried student loan debt as of 2010, up from 1 percent in 2004. \\"Some may think of student loan debt as a just a young person's problem,\\" said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who heads a Senate committee on aging and held a hearing on the findings on Wednesday. \\"As it turns out, that's increasingly not the case.\\" The 18.2 billion figure includes loans related to both the holders' education, often for those who have returned to school later in life, and their children's education, the report found. Across the United States, about 40 million Americans are paying back some 1.1 trillion in student loan debt. Student loans are a particular concern because unlike credit card debt or mortgages, they are typically government-backed and cannot be written off in bankruptcy proceedings, leaving retirees facing the risk of having their Social Security payments garnished to cover student loans. The cost of higher education in the United States has steadily increased over the past decade, with one year's costs for tuition, room and board, and other fees at the average four-year U.S. college coming to 23,872 for the 2012-2013 academic year, according to Department of Education data. That is up 21 percent, accounting for inflation. \\"Education debt has become a significant factor for younger workers, threatening a middle-class standard of living and at times even forcing some to delay their retirement,\\" said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP, the largest lobbying group representing retired Americans. \\"Student loan debt is also becoming a matter of serious concern for some older Americans many of who are still paying off their kids' debt or helping their grandkids well into their ‎retirement.\\" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Mohammad Zargham) ||||| Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images Most conversations about the dangers of student debt rightfully focus on the young. But a surprising number of elderly Americans are also still paying back education loans. And today, the Government Accountability Office unveiled a rather depressing report about how the government may be driving some of those retirees into poverty in its attempts to collect on their debt. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent. The problem stems from the way Washington handles defaults. Once a borrower has failed to pay back his federal loan for 425 days, the government has the power to withhold Social Security retirement and disability payments to offset the debt. In 2013, the GAO reports that 155,000 Americans, including 36,000 individuals older than 65, saw their benefits garnished in this fashion. Advertisement Because Social Security is designed to keep the elderly and infirm from falling into destitution, Congress very sensibly limited how much money the Treasury Department could withhold from their benefits when collecting on a student loan. Much less sensibly, the cap wasn’t indexed for inflation and hasn’t been updated since the 1990s. As a result, the GAO reports that, \\"the current limits may result in monthly benefits below the poverty threshold for certain defaulted borrowers.\\" To translate that into the clearest terms possible: Due to Congress' neglect, our government is now probably pushing somebody's grandparents into poverty so that they can settle up a bad college debt. Get Slate in your inbox. How many people are we talking about here? The report’s numbers are slightly opaque, but it looks like about 129,000 Americans total, including 27,000 senior citizens, would have kept more of their Social Security payments if the withholding limits had kept pace with the poverty line.1 We don’t know for sure that every one of these individuals is being driven into poverty, since some of them may have income from other sources. But the fact that we even have to worry about the possibility is disturbing. In the end, we’re only talking about a problem afflicting a relative handful of people. But that also means it would be fairly painless to fix. Fixing the withholding limits to make sure nobody’s benefit payments fell below the poverty level would have cost just 94 million in 2013. This does not seem like a hard trade-off to make. Of course, the really humane thing would be to finally let Americans discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, so they aren’t dogged by their borrowing mistakes deep into old age. But baby steps first. * * * ||||| Financial Aid Elderly Americans have more student loan debt than ever and are more likely to become chronically unable to make payments than younger borrowers. Those findings from a new report by the Government Accountability Office took center stage at Wednesday’s Senate hearing on how seniors deal with unprecedented education debt. Federal student debt among Americans 65 and older increased sixfold since 2005, reaching 18.2 billion in 2013, according to the report. Over 80 percent of elderly borrowers were still struggling to pay off loans they took out to pay for their education, which suggests that the debt ballooned, in part, due to interest. United States Government Accountability Office Seniors hold a small minority of all student debt in the country, but their fate is a cautionary tale for today’s students taking out more and bigger loans. It is also a sign of financial stress to come for people who are heading toward retirement. Some 31 percent of the student loans held by Americans aged 65 and older were in default last year. That makes the elderly about twice as likely to hold defaulted loans as Americans under the age of 50. Defaulting on student loans is bad for anyone: It can harm your credit and multiply your debt by adding fees. For older Americans, the consequences can be especially dire. United States Government Accountability Office More elderly Americans are seeing retirement benefits cut to order to repay education debt, as Bloomberg Businessweek reported last month. The government reduced the Social Security payments or other retirement benefits of 155,000 people last year to pay off student loans, according to the new GAO report, up from just 31,000 in 2002. A 1998 law specified that the government could not seize more than 15 percent of people’s retirement benefits or leave them with a check of less than 750. At the time that limit was above the poverty line. The limit hasn’t since increased and is now about 181 under the poverty threshold for a person over the age of 65. Most of those who saw Social Security payments slashed to repay student loans in 2013 were living on benefit income that was under the poverty line. “If the offset limit had been indexed to match the rate of increase in the poverty threshold,” the report noted, “in 2013, 68 percent of all borrowers whose Social Security benefits were offset for federal student loan debt would have kept their entire benefit.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A recent federal report reveals that the rising cost of higher education in the US is following Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans.

The cost of higher education in the US has steadily increased over the past decade, causing a middle-class standard of living and even forcing some to delay their retirement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose Less isotopes turn into different elements happens, how will it affect LESS radioactive decay occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If fewer isotopes turn into different elements, it would mean that LESS radioactive decay is occurring. This is because radioactive decay is the process through which isotopes turn into different elements by either losing or gaining particles. When the isotopes are stable and have a lower tendency of turning into different elements, the overall radioactive decay in the affected system will be reduced. In the given scenario, the supposed perturbation (fewer isotopes turning into different elements) will lead to LESS effect on the second effect mentioned (radioactive decay). This reduction in radioactive decay is a direct outcome of the decrease in the number of unstable isotopes undergoing the transformation process. Consequently, fewer atomic particles will be emitted, and the overall radiation output will also decrease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it is essential to critically analyze the various components of this hypothesis and assess their validity in conjunction with the given premise. Firstly, the premise highlights that minor clerical errors, such as typographical errors, can lead to appeals. An appeal, in this context, refers to a legal process wherein a case or judgment is reviewed by a higher court. Such errors are described as seemingly insignificant and perhaps difficult to detect. Yet, these errors can provide grounds for an appeal, as suggested by the \\"appeal the hell out of that\\" statement. This implies that minor clerical errors can indeed lead to time-consuming and resource-draining appeals. The premise then goes on to say that these appeals take two years to be resolved. Although the exact time frame could vary depending on the complexity of the case, system efficiency, and legal jurisdiction, the underlying notion is that such appeals prolong the legal process considerably. Assuming the mentioned figure is accurate, a minor clerical error has the potential to tie up an appeal for two years. Finally, the premise asserts that the issue of multiple appeals stemming from minor clerical errors is bogging down the whole system. \\"Bogging down\\" implies that the legal system is becoming increasingly burdened and less efficient as a result of these appeals. This can likely be attributed to the accumulation of cases waiting for resolution and the diversion of resources to handle these appeals, which could otherwise be allocated to address more significant legal concerns. As such, considering the premise, the hypothesis does seem to be true. It suggests that a minor clerical error can potentially tie up an appeal for two years and that the cumulative effect of numerous such appeals is bogging down the whole system. However, it is essential to recognize that the actual timeframes and impact may differ across legal systems and jurisdictions, as well as the efficiency and workload of the courts involved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CLOSE 50th Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich discusses Trump's possible appointment of Mitt Romney as Secretary of State with USA TODAY Washington bureau chief Susan Page. USA TODAY Former House speaker Newt Gingrich on USA TODAY's Capital Download (Photo: Sean Dougherty, USAT) WASHINGTON — Former House speaker Newt Gingrich calls Donald Trump a potentially transformative president. But he shouldn't have sent out that tweet alleging election fraud. In an interview Tuesday with Capital Download, Gingrich, a free-wheeling Trump adviser who is a vice-chairman of his transition team, described the president-elect as a leader who is poised to disrupt the regular order in a way no commander in chief has done since Andrew Jackson in the 19th century. But he also said that Trump's biggest misstep in the three weeks since he won the White House was to post on Twitter Sunday a complaint asserting widespread voter fraud, and in an election he won. \\"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide,\\" Trump wrote, \\"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\\" \\"The president of the United States can't randomly tweet without having somebody check it out,\\" Gingrich told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \\"It makes you wonder about whatever else he's doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet.\\" Does he see any evidence of millions of illegal votes? \\"No,\\" Gingrich says. The former House speaker, who led a political disruption of his own when Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1994, says the best thing Trump has done so far is to name campaign chairman Steve Bannon and Republican national chairman Reince Priebus to his top White House staff. \\"You have a very hard-line conservative warrior as your chief strategist and you have a really sophisticated manager of the establishment as your chief of staff,\\" he says. That said, Gingrich is caustic toward another potential Trump appointment, of Mitt Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. Trump and Romney were slated to meet Tuesday for a second time, reportedly to discuss the role of secretary of State for the GOP's 2012 nominee, who was perhaps Trump's fiercest Republican critic during the campaign. \\"I think it's outrageous,\\" Gingrich says. \\"Romney said vile and vicious things. Romney opposed him all the way up to the election. In my judgment, Romney will be a very high risk ... because I think Romney has zero interest in the Trump revolution and every interest in re-establishing his own credentials.\\" While he views former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as a better choice, Gingrich says House Speaker Paul Ryan \\"is very strongly in favor of Romney\\" and that Priebus is \\"pretty strongly\\" in favor of him. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, however, has warned of a grassroots revolt if Romney is named to the Cabinet's top job. When he met with Trump last week, Gingrich says, \\"He commented, 'This is really a bigger job than I thought.' Which is good. He should think that.\\" As president, Gingrich went on, \\"you have war and peace, you have enormous powers ... and it all comes down to the Oval Office and it all comes down to you.\\" He argues that Trump, who hasn't held a news conference since July, should feel no obligation to hold any as president, suggesting instead he solicit questions from the public to answer. \\"The news media so totally disgraced itself in this election, if I were Trump I would just say no,\\" Gingrich says. \\"And if the White House Correspondents Association doesn't like it, I'd say, 'Fine, disband.'\\" Gingrich says the political world hasn't yet come to grips with the sort of fundamental change the election of \\"the most insurgent president in American history\\" could bring. He describes Trump as \\"one-third Andrew Jackson in disruption, one-third Theodore Roosevelt in sheer energy, and one-third P.T. Barnum in selling all the time.\\" But he says Trump might need to occasionally curb his instincts. \\"He should tweet, but he ought to have an editorial board in-between the first draft and sending it,\\" he suggests — not an idea Trump seems likely to accept. \\"But he shouldn't give it up, and he shouldn't give up being Donald Trump. He got elected being this unique, charismatic, entrepreneurial guy who breaks lots of rules. ... If he starts getting to be normal, he'll cease being Donald J.

Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.wikipedia.","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Learning and Information Tool With Minor Flaws Rating: ★★★★☆ (4 out of 5 stars) Review: I have been an avid user of the app with the package org.wikipedia for quite some time now, and I must say it has significantly improved the way I access and gather information. This 4-star review will present an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of the app to help potential users make an informed decision. Firstly, the Wikipedia app has a sleek user interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. This makes for a smooth and enjoyable experience when searching for a specific article or merely browsing through a plethora of topics. The app also adjusts well to different screen sizes and orientations, making it a great resource for any mobile device user. Secondly, the app's offline support feature is incredibly handy. By downloading articles to read offline, I am able to access the app's wealth of information even in areas with limited or no internet connection. This has been particularly beneficial during long flights, boring commutes, and any other unexpected offline scenario since I always have access to reliable and in-depth articles. In addition to these two prominent features, the Wikipedia app has a few other qualities worth mentioning. The night mode option is a fantastic feature that reduces eye strain during late-night reading sessions. Furthermore, the app's integration with its sister sites, such as Wikidata or Wikimedia Commons, enhances the overall user experience and creates a complete knowledge base beyond just text-based articles. The language support is also commendable, with the app providing access to articles written in an impressively wide range of languages. There are, however, a few aspects of the Wikipedia app with the package org.wikipedia that could be improved. One minor flaw is the occasional slow load times for images and media within the articles. This issue can be frustrating, especially when using the app in areas with slower internet connections. Additionally, while the app's search function is generally adequate, it sometimes struggles with predictive suggestions and matching search queries to the most relevant results. Another point of concern is the reliability of the content. Although most articles are well-researched and informative, the content's user-generated nature means that some inaccuracies might be present. While this is true for all Wikipedia content, users should be aware of this potential drawback when using the app as a primary research source. Always consider validating the information found in the app with external sources. In conclusion, the app with the package org.wikipedia is a highly useful and comprehensive learning tool on multiple subjects, accommodating users seeking information on-the-go or offline. Despite the occasional slow load times and the potential unreliability of certain content, I believe the merits of this app far outweigh its drawbacks. I confidently rate the Wikipedia app at 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a user-friendly, informative, and versatile knowledge database on their mobile devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Using \\"Monday mornings\\" as our topic, I will use language that conveys a negative sentiment without crossing the line into overly severe or offensive territory. Step 3: Check tweet for alignment with sentiment. Given that the intent is to create a negative sentiment, I need to use words and phrases that generally elicit such feelings. Phrases like \\"struggling\\", \\"need more sleep\\", and \\"weekend is over\\" typically carry a negative connotation. I'll avoid using positive or neutral words to keep the tone consistent. So, here is a draft of the tweet that aligns with these steps: \\"Monday mornings are always so rough! Struggling to open my eyes. Need more sleep but the weekend is over. #MondayBlues\\" Step 4: Review and revise. The tweet effectively communicates a negative sentiment by focusing on the hardships of waking up early on a Monday morning, signifying the end of the weekend. It uses the hashtag #MondayBlues which further amplifies the negative tone. Conclusion: With these considerations in mind, this tweet fits the required negative sentiment.

Answer:","completion":"Carbon fixation occurs in a somewhat unique manner in C4 plants as compared to other plant types. In C4 plants, the process of carbon fixation takes place in two distinct locations within the leaf, primarily the mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells, through a two-step mechanism. Before addressing the locations, it's essential to understand why C4 plants have evolved this method. C4 plants have adapted to thrive in environments with high temperatures, intense sunlight, and limited water availability. These conditions cause the typical carbon fixation process in C3 plants to operate less efficiently due to a phenomenon called photorespiration. C4 plants, like corn, sorghum, and sugar cane, use a more efficient way to capture carbon dioxide and minimize photorespiration. The process of carbon fixation in C4 plants begins in the mesophyll cells, which are found within the leaf tissue surrounding the bundle sheath cells. In the first step, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a three-carbon compound, binds with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of the enzyme PEP carboxylase, forming a four-carbon compound called oxaloacetate. This step distinguishes C4 plants and gives them their name. Next, the C4 plant processes the oxaloacetate to form malate or aspartate, both of which are four-carbon compounds capable of transporting carbon dioxide. These compounds then move from the mesophyll cells to the bundle sheath cells, a layer of cells lining the vascular tissue responsible for carrying water and nutrients throughout the plant. Inside the bundle sheath cells, malate or aspartate release the carbon dioxide they transported from the mesophyll cells, thus providing a high concentration of carbon dioxide for the Calvin cycle to take place. The high CO2 concentration minimizes photorespiration, giving C4 plants an advantage in warmer and drier environments. The carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which is mainly located in bundle sheath cells, as part of the Calvin cycle. Upon the release of CO2, the remaining three-carbon molecules (pyruvate or alanine) are transported back to the mesophyll cells, where they are converted back to PEP using ATP generated during photosynthesis. The regenerated PEP is then ready to begin the next round of carbon fixation in the mesophyll cells. In summary, carbon fixation in C4 plants occurs in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. The process enhances their photosynthetic capacity in high light, high temperature, and water-limited conditions by minimizing the energy-wasting process of photorespiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit...

In addition, can you also investigate the film's directorial methods in portraying these issues, such as the use of historical footage, newspaper headlines, and Milk's posthumous narration via his 'Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter'? Finally, discuss the implications and contemporary perspectives of figures like Diane Feinstein, whose career has taken her from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors during Milk's era to U.S. Senator, in the context of the narrative of the film, highlighting its relevance in today's society.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the elements of this sentence to better understand the sentiment. 1. \\"even if you're an agnostic carnivore\\": This phrase sets a context that the statement goes beyond the usual target audience, which can be seen as an inclusive perspective. The mention of \\"agnostic carnivore\\" might also add a touch of humor by using unexpected terminology to describe the reader or someone who may not be immediately inclined to enjoy the subject in question. 2. \\"you can enjoy much of Jonah simply, and gratefully\\": The sentiment here is also positive, as it suggests that the person would be able to appreciate and find enjoyment in \\"Jonah.\\" The adverbs \\"simply\\" and \\"gratefully\\" indicate that this enjoyment doesn't require extensive effort or a particular mindset—allowing the person to appreciate it naturally and be thankful for the experience. 3. \\"as laugh-out-loud lunacy\\": This phrase adds another positive aspect, as it describes the humor in \\"Jonah\\" as so funny that it's capable of provoking laughter out loud. The term \\"lunacy\\" might be seen as a mildly negative connotation, but in this context, it's used to emphasize the level of humor and absurdity that many individuals find enjoyable. 4. \\"with a pronounced Monty Pythonesque flavor\\": The comparison to Monty Python, a well-known and beloved British comedy group, adds an additional positive sentiment to the statement. Describing the humor as \\"pronounced\\" emphasizes that this is a major aspect of the experience, and a strong influence that fans of Monty Python comedy would particularly appreciate. By evaluating these components of the sentence, we can conclude that the overall sentiment is positive. The statement acknowledges the humor and enjoyment in \\"Jonah,\\" even for individuals who might not be the typical target audience, and identifies similarities to the widely appreciated Monty Python comedy. This recognition of humor and inclusivity, along with the comparison to a popular comedy group, creates a perception of fun and lightheartedness surrounding \\"Jonah.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation . - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources. - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include: - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation. - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention. - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal. - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics. - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan. - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\" - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\" Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'facet of' with the subject 'similarity '.

For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide information about what the song \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is about. It only states the international release's performance on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by the band's frontman, Kurt Cobain. It was released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero,\\" in 1993. While the exact meaning of the song is open to interpretation, several explanations and themes have been suggested. One common interpretation is that it is a song about love and relationships, particularly Cobain's relationship with his then-wife, Courtney Love. Some of the lyrics, such as \\"She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak\\" and \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black,\\" may represent the character's vulnerability and desire to heal their partner's emotional pain. Another theory is that the song confronts the concept of fame and the effect it had on Kurt Cobain and the rest of the band members. The lyrics \\"I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\\" could be seen as a metaphor for being trapped inside the overwhelming expectations and pressures associated with fame. The song's music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, has also fueled various interpretations of the song's meaning. The video features surreal imagery, such as fetuses hanging from trees, while Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl perform the song in a field. There's also a man in a Santa Claus hat, an old woman in a wheelchair, and crow imagery, which could suggest themes of birth, death, and rebirth. In summary, while \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is open to various interpretations, the answer you found on Google focuses on the song's chart performance rather than exploring its themes and meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it's reasonable to assume that the band and singer are performing for an audience, given the notion that musicians generally perform for audiences, we cannot derive this information solely based on the premise itself—the premise does not specifically mention a live crowd or the existence of an audience. They could be performing in a rehearsal, an empty venue, or for a recorded video, among other possibilities. To conclude, the first part of the hypothesis (\\"A band and a singer are performing\\") can be determined accurate, derived from the provided premise. However, the second part of the hypothesis (\\"for an audience\\") cannot be confirmed based only on the information given in the premise.

Plot title: An American Haunting Movie plot: This synopsis is from the UNRATED VERSION.A girl (Jane Powell) (Isabelle Almgren-Doré) is running through snowy woods near her house in Boston, Massachusetts. Something unseen is chasing her. She approaches the house and tries to open a double door. It opens and she rushes in, closing it and an inner door which she latches shut. She looks around, picking up a letter opener and leaves the room. The door is forced open by the unseen force. She runs upstairs into her bedroom, bolting the door. The doorknob is rattled as the unseen tries to get in. The noise stops and there is silence. The girl cautiously approaches the door when suddenly the ghostly image of a girl (Betsy Bell) (Rachel Hurd-Wood) appears beside her. She screams and at that moment awakens from a dream, sitting up in bed in hysterics. She is comforted by her mother (Elizabeth Powell) (Susan Almgren) who tells her she had a bad dream again. She suggests a nice warm bath, which is rejected by Jane, saying maybe later. The mother tells her she must get ready to be picked up by her father (David Powell) (Howard Rosenstein) for the weekend. She acknowledges this. Elizabeth picks up some clothes from the floor, noticing a bundle of old things which she asks Jane about. Telling her mother they are from the attic, Jane is told you know the attic is off-limits. Jane apologizes and is told just dont do it again as the mother exits. Jane goes into a fetal position on her bed.Elizabeth goes into the study carrying the old doll and things from the attic.

Options: a ) 30 , b ) 40 , c ) 50 , d ) 60 , e ) 65 A:","completion":"In this task, we are asked to find out how long the food will last after 50 men leave the hostel. To do this, we will follow simple steps based on the information given in the problem. Here's a breakdown of the problem and guidelines on how to use the given information: 1. The hostel had provisions for 250 men for 48 days. 2. We need to find out how long the food will last if 50 men leave the hostel. 3. To find the answer, first, we need to determine the total amounts of provisions the hostel had initially. We can do that by multiplying the number of men (250) by the number of days (48): 250 men × 48 days = 12,000 man-days. 4. Next, we will determine the number of men remaining in the hostel. Since 50 men left the hostel, there are now 250 men – 50 men = 200 men. 5. Now, we need to find out how many days the provisions will last for these 200 men. To do this, we will divide the total man-days (12,000) by the number of remaining men (200): 12,000 man-days ÷ 200 men = 60 days. So, the food will last for 60 days after 50 men leave the hostel.

In their little quaint village, they had a beautiful pond that was home to hundreds of tadpoles. Every summer, Craig would head over to the pond at the crack of dawn, excitedly carrying a clear jar and a net with him to catch some of the tiny creatures. Step 1: Establishing the characters' contrasting interests By emphasizing Craig's love for tadpoles and Samuel's disinterest, this step allows the reader to understand the primary difference between the two characters and how their interests may affect their interactions and choices in the story. Step 2: Introducing the setting Describing the village and the pond provides the reader with a visual image of the story's environment and the significance of the pond in the characters' lives. As Craig went through this routine each morning, Samuel would often accompany him, not because he shared Craig's enthusiasm for tadpoles, but simply because he cherished spending time with his best friend. Despite his lack of interest in the aquatic creatures, Samuel found joy in observing Craig's infectious passion for them. He would often sit under a nearby tree, watching as Craig meticulously examined each tadpole, classifying them by their size, color, and stage of development. Step 3: Developing the characters' friendship By showcasing Samuel's support for Craig even though he doesn't share the same fascination, this step helps to deepen the characters' friendship and provides insight into their bond over shared experiences. One day, as Craig carefully scooped a jar full of tadpoles, he discovered a tiny, glistening egg nestled among the plants at the bottom of the pond. Craig was thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the miraculous birth of a tadpole and eagerly showed Samuel his treasure. Step 4: Introducing a new element into the story Adding the discovery of the egg creates a plot point that can further develop the story and potentially create a shared experience or challenge for the two characters. Samuel's curiosity was piqued by the egg's mysterious nature, and despite his general aversion to tadpoles, he found himself surprisingly invested in the outcome. Craig and Samuel decided to protect the egg and monitor its development, each day watching with anticipation as it began to change. Step 5: Creating a shared experience for the characters Samuel's newfound interest in the egg creates a common goal for the two friends and allows the reader to explore how their shared experience can further develop their friendship and bond. As the days passed, the egg grew larger, and the friends would speculate about what kind of creature it would become. Samuel found himself opening up to the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might grow to love tadpoles as much as Craig did. Together, they patiently awaited the day when the egg would finally hatch and reveal a new tadpole to the world, uniting them in shared wonder and excitement for the cycle of life. Step 6: Finalizing the story's development The shared experience of caring for the egg leads to Samuel's growth as a character and demonstrates how the friendship between the two has evolved. Their bond strengthens, and the story concludes with a sense of unity and anticipation for the future."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Experts Say Obama Must Build a Bipartisan Machine to Move Education Law President-elect Barack Obama has made big promises to educators, parents and the nation's nearly 50 million public school students. He vowed to recruit an \\"army of new teachers,\\" create better tests and give public schools more funding. He also said he would make college more affordable. As the new administration prepares to take over the Education Department, school experts say one of Obama's first -- and toughest -- jobs must be restoring the broad bipartisan support it took to pass the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, which aims to boost the achievement of poor children. That consensus has splintered, with people on both sides of the aisle souring on the law as it is overdue for reauthorization in Congress. \\"Forget the details of No Child Left Behind. The big challenge there is having to rebuild that bipartisan coalition,\\" said Gary Huggins, director of the Commission on No Child Left Behind, an independent effort of the Aspen Institute. \\"On the Democratic side you have people walking away from it because of union pushback. On the GOP side you have people walking away because this is too large a federal footprint.\\" Helping ensure college access is likely to be the next president's most pressing education priority. The financial downturn has raised concerns about the continuing availability of student loans. On Thursday, the Education Department announced plans to expand purchases of the loans it backs, the most recent of several steps to help avert a student loan crisis. \\"The most immediate issue is just the question of stability within the student loan programs,\\" said Alexa Marrero, spokeswoman for Rep. Howard P. \\"Buck\\" McKeon (Calif.), ranking Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee. \\"If we realize there's a problem, it will be too late.\\" But it is Obama's vision of refining the federal role in America's classrooms that may be the biggest political and policy challenge. He inherits an agency -- and a law -- that is seen by some local schools and union leaders as focusing more on sanctions and policing than on helping build better schools. The Education Department, created in 1980, has a 68.6 billion annual budget and plays a relatively minor role in financing for the nation's public schools. Much of its kindergarten-through-12th-grade spending focuses on helping students from poor families. But No Child Left Behind, enacted under President Bush, ushered in unprecedented federal influence in classrooms with a massive expansion of testing. With the aim of having all children proficient in reading and math by 2014, schools must meet steadily rising test score goals or risk sanctions as severe as a forced management shakeup. Federal education officials have supported states in creating tests and improving instruction, but the Bush administration also has clashed with local school leaders over testing requirements, even threatening to withhold federal dollars. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings is known for experimenting with ways to make the law more flexible for schools and states but also for protecting what she calls the law's \\"bright line\\" testing and accountability regimen. Previous secretaries, including William Bennett in the Reagan administration, Lamar Alexander in the George H.W. Bush presidency and Richard W. Riley in the Clinton administration, have used the office as a platform to push for one brand of school reform or another. Various names have been floated as possible successors to Spellings, but no clear front-runner has emerged. On Thursday, Anne L. Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards Association, called on the incoming administration to \\"facilitate, not dictate.\\" Efforts in Congress to reauthorize No Child Left Behind stalled as lawmakers awaited a new president. On his campaign Web site, Obama promised to \\"improve NCLB's accountability system so that we are supporting schools that need improvement, rather than punishing them.\\" And he said he would support merit pay programs designed in concert with teachers. Education experts say the next president will have to put a leader at the helm of the department who can reinvigorate support for the federal role in reforming public education. People in both major parties have railed against, and rallied for, No Child Left Behind. In a letter this month to the Wall Street Journal, Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) called No Child Left Behind \\"the most massive shift from personal freedom to government intervention.\\" Hoekstra wrote: \\"Once you've sold out parents and children, voting for massive spending increases to fund NCLB, selling out freedom in other areas became very easy, almost necessary.\\" The Democratic-supporting teachers unions aren't happy either. The National Education Association has called the law \\"prescriptive and punitive.\\" But an unusual coalition of business and civil rights leaders, including the Business Roundtable, the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza, supports the law. They worry that too many revisions will weaken the government resolve to force schools to help disadvantaged students. \\"The big challenge for President-elect Obama is he's going to have to appease the reformers, but also the teacher's unions, and that's going to be a delicate dance,\\" said Michael J. Petrilli, who was associate assistant deputy secretary in the Education Department from 2001 to 2005 and now works at the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, an education think tank. \\"They are all going to be watching for signs that he's with them.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"President-elect Barack Obama faces the challenge of rebuilding bipartisan support for the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, which aims to boost the achievement of underprivileged children while addressing issues related to college affordability and the federal role in public education reform.

The alert adds a new level of complexity to the looming challenges as firefighting personnel battle the blaze that has already had devastating consequences. This past Sunday, the firefighting community was hit hard by the Yarnell Hill fire, which resulted in the tragic loss of 19 brave firefighters. Their untimely deaths signify the potential dangers that these servicemen and women confront in their line of duty. In light of these events, and the potential for erratic winds, national resources are being mobilized to aid in the ongoing firefighting efforts. Four C-130 aircraft have been dispatched to the ravaged region. Known for their high capacity and unerring capabilities, these planes are anticipated to significantly bolster the area's firefighting power. The C-130s, crucial for their capacity to drop massive amounts of water or fire retardant, will contribute greatly to efforts at curbing the fire's continued spread. The advantage they offer is two-fold. Not only can large volumes of water suffocate the fires, but the fire retardant will also help to create preventive barriers, hindering further proliferation of the blaze. As the situation continues to unfold, the unexpected may yet occur. Despite the forecaster's predictions that extreme 80-mph wind gusts are \\"unlikely\\", the potential remains. This possibility underlines the unpredictable, volatile nature of wildfires and the extent of the challenge faced by those bravely coming face-to-face with the flames. Through such Herculean efforts, these brave individuals are not only fighting the existing flames but also working tirelessly to prevent further loss and devastation. It is their resilience and relentless efforts that offer a ray of hope amidst the trying circumstances. The sacrifices made, lives lost, and collective efforts underline the severe magnitude of the Arizona wildfires and the fight that continues against them.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Here's an analysis of the key factors contributing to this rating: 1. Enthusiasm: The reviewer's choice of words, including \\"best\\" and \\"ever\\", indicates a high level of enthusiasm about the tool. This suggests that they had a positive experience and are impressed by its capabilities. Additionally, using an exclamation mark at the end of the statement expresses their excitement, further emphasizing their satisfaction. 2. Focus on the tool's capabilities: The review specifically mentions \\"Android and Linux integration\\" as the key feature, highlighting the tool's efficiency and usefulness in this domain. This speaks to the tool's ability to cater to the needs of those using both Android and Linux-based systems. 3. Brevity: While a brief review may sometimes lack sufficient detail to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the product, its brevity can also work in its favor. A concise, positive statement like this may resonate with potential users, piquing their interest and encouraging them to explore the tool further. However, it may not provide readers with enough context or information to fully grasp the reasons behind the reviewer's satisfaction. 4. Lack of specific details: The rating loses a point because the review does not provide any specific examples or details about what the user liked or what particularly impressed them. Details such as ease of use, compatibility, unique features, and support could have made their recommendation more credible and informative. In conclusion, I would give the review a 4 out of 5. It effectively communicates the author's enthusiasm and satisfaction with the tool's Android and Linux integration capabilities.

In this case, the reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with a double-stick tape shower clip product. Here are some reasons why the review can be considered negative: 1. Dissatisfaction with product quality: The reviewer states that the double-stick tape on the clips did not last very long. This is a clear indication that the customer was not satisfied with the product's performance and perceived it as low-quality. 2. Difficulty in removing the product: The customer mentions having to remove the remaining tape from the tiles with a razer blade, which gives the impression that this is not an easy process. The inconvenience here adds a negative aspect to the overall product experience. 3. Unfulfilled expectations: The reviewer highlights that they have yet to find shower clips that work well. This implies that they had expectations that this product would solve their problem but were left disappointed.

Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

Question: Who is the agent in charge of Bang-hee's case? Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: An elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. It is revealed that Park...

Process: - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - suppose there is no oxygen to breath in happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"Directly impacting a step of the process. When there is no oxygen to breathe in, it directly impacts the process of respiration. Specifically, it affects the following steps: 1. Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - Since there is no oxygen in the air being inhaled, the lungs will not receive the necessary amount of oxygen. 2. The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Due to the lack of oxygen in the inhaled air, there won't be enough molecules for the membranes in the lungs to collect and transfer. 3. Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - With less oxygen available, only a limited amount will be transferred to the red blood cells. 4. Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - As there is less oxygen in the red blood cells, the amount of oxygen being distributed throughout the body will be significantly reduced. This perturbation of the process as a result of having no oxygen to breathe in would have a direct impact on the process, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the body's tissues and organs, which could cause severe health issues or even be life-threatening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Right now , waiting for me in a small bowl is a mixture of curry powder , ginger , salt , sugar , flour . The aroma of the curry powder is all over the house . Available options: (1). I use too much curry powder for the meal .. (2). The curry gets burned by having it on high heat for too long. (3). None of the above choices .. (4). I use a lot of spices and aromatic herbs .. Answer the following question: What may happen during the time that i cook ?","completion":"During the time that you cook, various outcomes may occur depending on the choices you make and the techniques you employ. Here is a detailed explanation of each option and the potential consequences on the aroma, taste, and overall quality of the curried chicken dish: (1). If you use too much curry powder for the meal: Adding an excessive amount of curry powder may result in an overpowering flavor and aroma. The balance between spices, heat, and savory and sweet elements may be disrupted, leading to a dish that lacks the desired harmony of flavors. Additionally, using too much curry powder can contribute to an increased risk of burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan due to its ground spices. Mixing the curry powder with oil or tomato-based sauces can reduce the likelihood of sticking and enhance the flavors of the dish. (2). If the curry gets burned by having it on high heat for too long: Cooking the curry on high heat for an extended period may result in the dish developing an unpleasant, bitter taste due to burned spices. The high heat may also cause the chicken to become overcooked, losing essential moisture and becoming less tender in the process. Moreover, the burned aroma could permeate the rest of the dish and even the surrounding environment. To prevent this outcome, opt for cooking the curry on medium or low heat for an extended time, which allows the spices to meld, the chicken to cook evenly, and the flavors to develop without the risk of burning. (3). If none of the above choices occurs: Assuming you have measured and added the correct amount of curry powder, ginger, salt, sugar, and flour, and have cooked the dish under an optimal temperature and duration, the desired outcome is a curried chicken with a beautifully balanced aromatic, savory, and spicy flavor profile. The dish would exude a pleasant aroma and satisfy your taste buds, making it a culinary success. (4). If you use a lot of spices and aromatic herbs: Incorporating a variety of spices and aromatic herbs not only enhances the flavors of the dish but also helps build layers of taste and aroma, contributing to a more complex and intricate dish. Utilizing a diverse range of spices, such as cumin, coriander, paprika, and cinnamon, or adding aromatic herbs like cilantro or basil, can elevate the curried chicken beyond a standard rendition and provide a unique and memorable eating experience. However, it is essential to balance these bold flavors with care, ensuring that no particular herb or spice becomes too overpowering. In conclusion, the successful outcome of your curried chicken will depend on proper measurements of ingredients, careful heat management while cooking, and a balanced blend of spices and herbs. These factors will contribute to a dish with a fabulous aroma and taste, maintaining the harmonious combination of flavors that curried chicken is known for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

M: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that? F: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \\"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document. M: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time? W: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.

Let me break down how I reached this conclusion for a better understanding: 1. First, I understood the definition of cognition: Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. 2. Second, applying this definition to the question, cognition about one's own cognitive processes meant a self-awareness of how one's mental processes or thinking patterns function. 3. In psychology, there's a specific term for this kind of self-scrutiny of one's own mental processes: Metacognition. 4. The understanding of one's own cognitions or thought processes is a core aspect of Metacognition. This includes being aware when you’re processing information, understanding the notion of thinking processes, and learning strategies. 5.

Regrettably, my most recent visit to [Place] delivered a less than satisfactory experience, leaving me somewhat frustrated and ultimately disappointed. Upon arrival, I was met with a lackluster presentation - the scenery was unimpressively mundane and not what was expected, considering the embellished descriptions and gleaming reviews circulated online. The environment did not exude the touted ambiance of relaxation and excitement it had promised. Instead, it was overwhelmingly strewn with litter – a complete eyesore that ironically stole the attention from what the place was originally known for. Service, which should have been the saving grace in light of the troubling environmental disarray, unfortunately, was as underwhelming. The staff were seemingly uninterested in their roles, ignoring customers instead of welcoming them as expected in such a setting. Information provided was often scarce and offered with an air of indisputable indifference. There was an overall lack of the welcoming charm we travelers both need and appreciate - mainly because traveling to a new place can be daunting. In terms of amenities, the place was drastically lacking. Restroom facilities were in an appalling state – unclean, under-supplied, and unattended for what seemed like a considerable length of time. Dining options were limited and the food was mediocre at best, not offering equal value for the price points. Product quality and variety should be compulsory within such spaces because they directly impact the customer's experience. Accessibility was another annoying issue. Getting around was unnecessarily arduous since the place was scarcely signposted. As a result, navigation turned into unexpected, avoidable chore. An efficient mapping system or clear directional indicators would vastly improve the situation. Even given the leniency of appreciation for various environments, the safety measures in and around the place were questionable. Protective guidelines were not clearly stated, and measures to ensure individual safety were strikingly absent. Proactively ensuring the safety of tourists and guests should be a top concern for any reputable establishment. In conclusion, my journey to [Place] was not an agreeable encounter. It was marred by poor service, wretched amenities, lack of cleanliness, difficulty in navigation, and questionable safety provisions. Until significant improvements are made, I am inclined to advise potential visitors to consider alternative places where the value, enjoyment, and safety are more guaranteed. Though this review is negative, it comes from a place of hoping to see [Place] rise to the standards it has the potential to reach but hasn't yet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Review: DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans; this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making features everything hecklers can ask for--non-existent plotting, terrible acting (save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady), laughable scripting and schlock editing, and bargain-basement style background settings. There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting (in particular, the lead doesn't have ANYTHING appealing about him), and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F-grade material. If that's not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and/or scantily clad; 2) get raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, the background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral bursts, and blaring orchestral cacophony. Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that in here).

Wishing well: Wishing wells are typically considered a non-productive way to spend money, as they are based on superstition. However, it's an occasional activity, so it's possible that his parents consider it harmless fun. 2. Piggy bank: Saving money in a piggy bank is generally a responsible way to manage finances, so this option seems less likely because the prompt mentions that James's parents felt he was wasting his money. 3. Eat cake: This option doesn't make much sense, as it doesn't specify putting a coin anywhere or have a clear relationship to wasting money. 4. Change purse: A change purse is for storing coins and small amounts of cash. This option does not indicate that James is wasting his money, so it is less likely to be the correct answer. 5. Parking meter: Putting coins in a parking meter is a necessary expense if someone needs to park their car. While this may seem like a waste of money in some situations, it doesn't align with the idea of James's parents allowing him to put a coin there every weekend in a lackadaisical manner.

Betty being lazy.;","completion":"When it comes to skateboarding, Elena is much better compared to Betty due to OPTIONS: (A). Elena being lazy.; (B). Betty being lazy. To continue writing the text, we must first choose between the provided options. In this case, we will choose option B: \\"Betty being lazy.\\" When it comes to skateboarding, Elena is much better compared to Betty due to Betty being lazy. While both girls started learning how to skateboard at the same time, their progress has been significantly different. This can largely be attributed to their varying levels of dedication and effort they've put into honing their skills. Step 1: Identify the difference in dedication level. Elena has always been enthusiastic about skateboarding, spending hours every day practicing her tricks and improving her balance. She watches skateboard tutorials, takes notes, and eagerly experiments with new techniques. This dedication and passion for the sport is evident in her progress. Step 2: Explore Betty's lack of effort. On the other hand, Betty has yet to develop the same level of dedication. Instead of spending time practicing, she often chooses to do other activities or procrastinate. As a result, her progress has been much slower than Elena's. Step 3: Analyze the impact of laziness on skill development. Betty's laziness directly impacts her ability to become better at skateboarding. While she may possess the innate talent for it, her lack of practice and commitment holds her back from reaching her full potential. Step 4: Demonstrate the outcome of their efforts. With each passing day, the gap between Elena's and Betty's abilities widens. Elena continues to master new tricks and refine her skills, while Betty remains stagnant, unable to progress past basic maneuvers. Step 5: Conclude by reiterating the main point. In conclusion, Elena's impressive skateboarding skills can be attributed to her dedication and hard work, whereas Betty's slower progress is a direct result of her laziness. It goes to show that consistent effort and devotion are imperative to achieving success in any endeavor."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Review: Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama, and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels is both realistic and involving, that is enough so to make it a memorable film. The plot is strait forward enough. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for Boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (at the wishes of there father). In the course of ninety minutes, we the viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behaviour, especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her, and she gets into it. There is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film. The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ruby Rose Langenheim (born 20 March 1986), better known as Ruby Rose, is an Australian model, DJ, recording artist, actress, television presenter, and former MTV VJ. Rose emerged in the media spotlight as a presenter on MTV Australia, followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition to her modelling career, she has co-hosted various television shows, namely Australia's Next Top Model and The Project on Network Ten. Rose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards, with her debut performance in the Australian film Suite for Fleur. In order to land her job as an MTV VJ in Australia, Rose competed against 2000 other hopefuls in a three-week national search, as former VJ Lyndsey Rodrigues moved to the United States to co-host TRL. As part of the competition, she downed 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes against Jackass's Bam Margera, and kissed strangers on a busy Sydney street. However, she enjoys her job as VJ compared to her previous job as a model. \\"Being a model there is always something they want to change. Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\\". In 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality. She also travelled to Kenya to \\"highlight ... [the] amazing work\\" done by Global Vision International. She appeared in the episode \\"Media Virgins\\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge, and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model. In July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten. She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical, which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host, and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan.

Possible A: kitchen, supermarket, table, stomach, restaurant Why is \\"kitchen\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Kitchen\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a space specifically designed and equipped for preparing and cooking food. When considering the task of making food, it is important to think about the necessary environment and tools for accomplishing this goal. Step 1: Analyze the context of the question. The question asks about the best place for making food, implying a location where it is most efficient and appropriate to prepare meals. Step 2: Evaluate each possible answer in terms of their suitability for making food. - Supermarket: A place where groceries and ingredients are sold, but not typically where food is prepared. - Table: A surface for serving or eating food but not designed for cooking or preparation. - Stomach: An organ in the body for digesting food, not a place for preparing or making food. - Restaurant: A place where food is prepared, but this option is usually associated with professional chefs or cooks rather than a general place for individuals to make food. Step 3: Determine the most suitable answer. Out of all possible answers, \\"kitchen\\" is the most suitable because it is a space where individuals have access to appliances, utensils, and other necessary equipment for preparing and cooking food.

Here's a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. (498 - 304) * w = 304*w + 1430 194 * w = 304*w + 1430 Step 2: Now, to isolate w, we must eliminate the term involving w on the right side of the equation. To do this, let's subtract 304*w from both sides. 194 * w - 304 * w = 304*w - 304*w + 1430 -110 * w = 1430 Step 3: Now, to find the value of w, divide both sides by -110.

Given the below context: Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

Question: - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process, as described, involves the interaction of specific particles with rocks, ultimately leading to the gradual breakdown of the rock material. In the context of geological processes, these particles could be natural or environmental agents such as water, ice, wind, or even other rock materials. This step can be described in more detail as follows: 1. Initial contact: The process begins with the particles (such as sand, sediment, or even small fragments of other rocks) coming into contact with the rock surface. This contact can be facilitated by natural forces such as wind, water currents, glacial movement, or even tectonic activity. The particles' size, composition, and the strength of the forces acting upon them will play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the rock's erosion and breakdown. 2. Abrasion and weathering: As the particles make contact with the rock surface, they act as abrasive agents, gradually wearing away small pieces of the rock material each time they touch it. This process is known as physical, or mechanical, weathering. Over an extended period, the repeated contact between the particles and the rock causes the surface to weaken and become more susceptible to further erosion and breakdown. 3. Formation of cracks and fractures: The constant interaction between the particles and the rock can lead to the formation of small cracks and fractures within the rock structure. These defects make the rock more vulnerable to other weathering processes, such as chemical weathering or freeze-thaw cycles, which can further weaken the rock and cause it to break apart more easily. 4. Continued impact and erosion: The particles continue to impact the rock, either directly or indirectly through wind, water, or ice movement. As the cracks and fractures in the rock become more pronounced, the mechanical weathering process accelerates, leading to the eventual breakdown of the rock structure. In summary, the first step of the process involves the interaction between specific particles and rocks initiated by various natural forces. This contact initiates a chain of events that ultimately causes the breakdown of rock material into smaller fragments, which are then subjected to further erosion and weathering processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Saturn 3 Movie plot: In the distant future, an overcrowded Earth relies on research conducted by scientists in remote stations across the solar system. One of these, a small experimental hydroponics research station on Saturn's third moon, is run solely by Adam (Douglas) and his colleague and lover Alex (Fawcett). Adam, the younger Alex and their dog Sally enjoy their isolation, far from an overcrowded and troubled Earth. The couple have been on Saturn 3 for three years, but Alex has spent all her life in space. Alex and Adam's idyll is broken by the arrival of Captain Benson (Keitel), who has been sent to Saturn 3 as part of a project to replace at least one of the moon's scientists with a robot. Benson assembles the robot and names him Hector. One of the first of its kind, a \\"Demigod Series\\", Hector relies on \\"pure brain tissue\\" extracted from human fetuses and programmed using a direct link to Benson's brain. Benson states that it will render one of the crew \\"obsolete\\", most likely Major Adam who tells his partner that he is close to \\"abort time\\" according to the government on Earth. Unknown to both Alex and Adam, Benson is a homicidal sociopath who murdered the captain originally assigned to Saturn 3 and took his place on the mission. Benson had actually failed a crucial test of psychological stability. As Benson uses the link to his brain to program the robot, Hector acquires Benson's homicidal nature and his lust for Alex. Hector initially kills Sally the dog and then assaults Benson, having learned about Benson being a murderer during the reprogramming process. Adam and Alex manage to disable the robot while it is recharging.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for orchestra. Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony). - Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. - Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instrumentstraditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances. - (Franz) Joseph Haydn (31 March 173231 May 1809) was a prolific Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\". - A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Edison Records was one of the earliest record labels which pioneered sound recording and reproduction and was an important player in the early recording industry. - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\" - The Haydn Quartet , later known as the Hayden Quartet , was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century . It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records ; it took its new name when recording for other companies . The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn , the classical composer ; the spelling was later revised to Hayden , which reflects the way it was pronounced . The group disbanded in 1914 . - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).

Answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The great man was moving with what seemed like great reluctance. He knew as he climbed from the car in Upper Manhattan that he was stepping into the maelstrom, that there were powerful people who would not react kindly to what he had to say. “I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,” said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “because my conscience leaves me no other choice.” This was on the evening of April 4, 1967, almost exactly 43 years ago. Dr. King told the more than 3,000 people who had crowded into Riverside Church that silence in the face of the horror that was taking place in Vietnam amounted to a “betrayal.” He spoke of both the carnage in the war zone and the toll the war was taking here in the United States. The speech comes to mind now for two reasons: A Tavis Smiley documentary currently airing on PBS revisits the controversy set off by Dr. King’s indictment of “the madness of Vietnam.” And recent news reports show ever-increasing evidence that we have ensnared ourselves in a mad and tragic venture in Afghanistan. Dr. King spoke of how, in Vietnam, the United States increased its commitment of troops “in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support.” It’s strange, indeed, to read those words more than four decades later as we are increasing our commitment of troops in Afghanistan to fight in support of Hamid Karzai, who remains in power after an election that the world knows was riddled with fraud and whose government is one of the most corrupt and inept on the planet. If Mr. Karzai is at all grateful for this support, he has a very peculiar way of showing it. He has ignored pleas from President Obama and others to take meaningful steps to rein in the rampant corruption. His brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, the kingpin in southern Afghanistan, is believed by top American officials to be engaged in all manner of nefarious activities, including money-laundering and involvement in the flourishing opium trade. Hamid Karzai himself pulled off a calculated insult to the U.S. by inviting Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidential palace in Kabul, where Ahmadinejad promptly delivered a fiery anti-American speech. As Dexter Filkins and Mark Landler reported in The Times this week: “Even as Mr. Obama pours tens of thousands of additional American troops into the country to help defend Mr. Karzai’s government, Mr. Karzai now often voices the view that his interests and the United States’ no longer coincide.” Is this what American service members are dying for in Afghanistan? Can you imagine giving up your life, or your child’s life, for that crowd? In his speech, Dr. King spoke about the damage the Vietnam War was doing to America’s war on poverty, and the way it was undermining other important domestic initiatives. What he wanted from the U.S. was not warfare overseas but a renewed commitment to economic and social justice at home. As he put it: “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.” The speech set loose a hurricane of criticism. Even the N.A.A.C.P. complained that Dr. King should stick to what it perceived as his area of expertise, civil rights. The New York Times headlined its editorial on the speech, “Dr. King’s Error.” Mr. Smiley, in his documentary, noted that “the already strained relationship between President Johnson and Dr. King became fractured beyond repair.” And donations to Dr. King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference “began to dry up.” So it took great courage for Dr. King to speak out as he did. His bold stand seems all the more striking in today’s atmosphere, in which moral courage among the very prominent  the kind of courage that carries real risk  seems mostly to have disappeared. More than 4,000 Americans have died in Iraq and more than 1,000 in Afghanistan, where the Obama administration has chosen to escalate rather than to begin a careful withdrawal. Those two wars, as the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and his colleague Linda Bilmes have told us, will ultimately cost us more than 3 trillion. And yet the voices in search of peace, in search of an end to the “madness,” in search of the nation-building so desperately needed here in the United States, are feeble indeed. Dr. King would be assassinated exactly one year (almost to the hour) after his great speech at Riverside Church. It’s the same terrible fate that awaits some of the American forces, most of them very young, that we continue to send into the quagmire in Afghanistan. ||||| Yesterday, as Alex Pareene noted , South Carolina Republican state Sen. Jake Knotts gave us an unusually frank rendition. Of his party’s front-running gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. Nikki Haley, Knotts said, \\"We already got one raghead in the White House. We don't need a raghead in the governor’s mansion.\\" Haley immigrated to the United States as a child from India. She is a convert to Methodism, from Sikhism. You know the pattern. Since the 2008 campaign, every few weeks or months some minor political figure in the GOP utters something scandalously racist about the president. The Republican Party distances itself from the comments. Democrats mutter about how the conservative movement is riddled with troglodytes. Nobody gets anywhere. Sikhs are, of course, not Muslims. Hailing from what is now the border area between Pakistan and India, Sikhism bears some similarities to Islam and Hinduism both, but is not a sect of either. To lump it in with Islam makes about as much sense as an insult as calling a Christian a kike. Same geographical origin, very rough theological similarities — close enough, right? Anyway, despite the crude literalism of the slur — like many Muslims, orthodox Sikh men wear turbans — it's fairly clear from the thrust of the insult that Knotts thought he was just calling Haley a sand nigger. (Like the president!) So here we have our troglodyte. Cue damage control. The state Republican chair, Karen Floyd, issued a statement condemning Knotts. And if it sounds a bit halfhearted, well, this is how these things always sound. \\"The South Carolina Republican Party strongly condemns any use of racial or religious slurs. Senator Knotts should apologize for his inappropriate comments, so that we can put this unfortunate incident behind us and focus on issues important to moving our state forward.\\" Knotts, for his part, has offered up a halfhearted retraction. He was kidding around, he says. Except, also, not. \\"Since my intended humorous context was lost in translation, I apologize. I still believe Ms. Haley is pretending to be someone she is not, much as Obama did, but I apologize to both for an unintended slur.\\" And now, here comes the charge of the left brigade, arguing that Knotts, not Floyd or Haley, represents the true soul of the GOP. That, I suppose, is me. The rumors about Haley, just like the ones about Barack Obama, wouldn't be around if they weren't compelling to some people. Knotts, who is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, seems to make some sense of the world around him by classifying Haley and Obama as foreigners, Middle Eastern category (roughly). But that doesn't really prove that racism is built into the right wing. All it shows is that the right wing includes racists within it. On this topic, Salon's editor, Joan Walsh, recently wrote, I'm coming to regret using the term \\"racist\\" about the Tea Party. \\"Racist\\" is a personal insult, and it's almost as impossible to prove it as to disprove it. It's not a terribly illuminating term, either: If you call me a racist, you haven't really described anything I've done that's objectionable. You've just somehow designated me, and my so-far unchallenged arguments, outside the pale, so to speak. This is true, and it's an important point. And it gets us closer to how we have to understand racism on the right. As Joan suggests, it's not worthwhile to claim that hatred and prejudice lurk in the heart of every conservative. \\"Hatred\\" and \\"prejudice\\" aren't even really especially useful concepts. They make racism seem much more personal and individual than it really is. Because racism isn't a parasite or a virus or even a personality defect that we can detect if we just know how to read the signs. It doesn't so much live in people as it exists between them. Racism helps people accomplish something; that's why they buy into it. It's a characteristic of their relationships, not of their selves. It's negotiated and mutable, rather than fixed in the soul. And the mutation we're seeing is a relatively new one. So if we're looking for racism on the right — if we're looking to explain Knotts — we need to look in the connective tissue of the conservative coalition, and ask, \\"What is racism doing here? What is it accomplishing for people?\\" Knotts’ comment fits into a pattern of plainly racial solidarity underlying conservative nationalism and war-on-terror ideology. You can see this all over the place: in the insistence that Obama, our first nonwhite president, must somehow be an ally or even a member of the teeming Islamic hordes. There's the hysteria about the \\"Islamicization\\" of Europe, cast fairly plainly in racial terms. There’s the love affair between the right wing and Israel; pundits love to attribute this to Christian conservative millennialism, but that doesn't do nearly enough explanatory work. Not every conservative ultra-Zionist is also a fundamentalist Christian. It's something else: The Jews, at least, are cousins, but the Arabs are brown-skinned strangers. Racism is, in this way, in the bones of the modern conservative movement. What we've seen in Knotts' comment is a little corner of an X-ray. Through the second half of the 20th century, anticommunism was what gave structure to otherwise disparate elements of conservatism — the libertarians, the social conservatives, the nationalist war hawks. The war on terror has had to tag in for the Cold War. Many of the trappings are the same: the paranoia about sleeper agents and Manchurian candidates within our own ranks certainly rings a bell. But the core of conservative animus and belligerence here is a belief in an irrevocable clash of civilizations that has been going on for centuries, and picks up on much of the legacy of Jim Crow-type racial conservatism. Even within the mainstream right, it's pretty clear that Islam is widely written off as the collective ailment of a vast, unitary empire, whose people will never understand anything except force. Read the National Review or the Weekly Standard for a little while (or even the New Republic, if you know where to look), and this assumption comes across unmistakably. (While I was writing this post, an item went up at the National Review whose only clear point appears to be the suggestion that Muslims are just criminal by nature. This, only several hours after a post condemning Knotts.) This works well for the social conservatives, who think they are doing God’s work by fighting Islam; it works for the nationalist conservatives who think that the world is being divided up between America and the Muslims. (It doesn't seem to work as well for the libertarians, who’ve been getting off the bus a little bit lately.) This isn't to say that Mark Steyn and Bill Kristol have Klan hoods in their closets. I'm sure they think of themselves as racial egalitarians and color-blind. (Well, I'm sure Kristol does, anyway.) Even Jake Knotts probably does. But they can’t defend the things that matter to them without racism. This is why well-meaning conservatives like Conor Friedersdorf get tripped up when they try to salvage the Tea Party from accusations of racism. Friedersdorf's argument was, essentially, it doesn't feel racist, it isn't supposed to be racist — so what do you want from them? But this is the thing: There's nothing to be done. Racism lives among right-wingers, not inside them. It's the air they breathe. And without it, there wouldn't be a coherent American conservatism. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The article talks about a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. against the Vietnam War and the negative effects it had on both the people in the war zone and the United States.

Given the below context: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper... Guess a valid title for it!

The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency, with the state establishing its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom.

Firstly, the reviewer begins their review with a strong and emotionally charged statement: \\"I think I was just discriminated against!\\" This assertion immediately sets the tone for the entire review as negative because it suggests that the reviewer feels unfairly treated. Next, the reviewer points out that the pharmacy refused to fill their prescription citing an unacceptable reason, which contributes to the negative sentiment. The mention of having filled prescriptions there seven-plus times highlights the reviewer's disappointment and an expectation of receiving better service. Moreover, the reviewer expresses feelings of being undervalued and possibly lied to; this further cements the negative sentiment of the review. Using a phrase like, \\"I'm so shaken up,\\" intensifies the negative feelings conveyed, as it illustrates that the event left a lasting and unfortunate impression on the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer strongly recommends taking business elsewhere, reinforcing the idea that other potential customers should avoid this pharmacy. This suggestion is undeniably negative, as it actively discourages new patrons and may potentially deter existing ones.

Write an article using the following points: Typhoon Bopha has so far killed 647 people in the Philippines. A another 780 people are missing, including hundreds of fishermen. Relief agencies are trying to help the thousands of people left homeless by the storm. Article:","completion":"Title: Typhoon Bopha: Grim Death Toll and a Humanitarian Crisis Unfolding in the Philippines Introduction: Typhoon Bopha, a category 5 storm that recently hit the Philippines, has left a trail of death, destruction, and a deepening humanitarian crisis in its wake. The destructive power of Bopha is only now becoming apparent, as local officials and humanitarian agencies try to assess the full extent of the carnage. Grim Death Toll and Missing Persons: Since Typhoon Bopha made landfall in the southern Philippines, the death toll continues to rise with at least 647 people confirmed dead, and there are concerns that this number may still increase. Another worrying development is the large number of still missing persons, with 780 unaccounted for, including hundreds of fishermen who were caught at sea when the storm hit. Homelessness and Humanitarian Response: In the hardest-hit areas, where the storm has left thousands of people homeless, the challenge now is to provide these storm victims with essential services such as food, drinking water, shelter, and clothing. The disaster has reached such a scale that it has even pushed the government and several humanitarian relief agencies to seek international assistance in a race against time to mitigate the immediate dangers these storm survivors face. Aid agencies, like the Philippine Red Cross, World Food Program, and UNICEF, have been actively involved in providing much-needed supplies and support for those affected by this catastrophe. The Philippine government, along with these aid organizations, have set up temporary accommodations, distributed relief goods, and provided medical assistance to the thousands in need. The Aftermath and Recovery: As Typhoon Bopha slowly loses power and dissipates, the ordeal for the people of the Philippines is far from over. The struggle now is to rebuild their lives and recover from the crippling damage left behind. Many homes, schools, and businesses were flattened, and with damaged infrastructure, travel and communication have become challenging, further complicating rescue and recovery efforts. Environmental Impact and Future Concerns: The environmental impacts of Typhoon Bopha are also severe. Soil erosion and landslides have become a major concern, particularly in the hardest-hit areas where vast swaths of agricultural land and forests were wiped out. This devastation can have significant long-term impacts on food security and livelihoods in the country. Typhoon Bopha follows a series of storms that have battered the Philippines in recent years. Climate change is often cited as a key factor leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of major typhoons, making the Philippines more vulnerable to similar natural disasters in the future. Conclusion: The tragedy of Typhoon Bopha cannot be understated. The people of the Philippines are grappling with the dual challenges of mourning their lost loved ones and rebuilding their lives. Yet, the resilience and hope displayed by the Filipinos in these trying times undeniably serve as a beacon of inspiration to many. As the international community comes together to help the Philippines in its time of need, dialogue and action on climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction must not be delayed. It is crucial to recognize the urgent need for long-term strategies and proactive measures to better prepare for and protect against the devastating impacts of severe weather events in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which would lose a proton more easily, sample A or sample B? Hint: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, Sample A, which is a strong acid, would lose a proton more easily than Sample B, the weak acid. This is because the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton, and strong acids completely dissociate in water, yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base A-. In contrast, weak acids only partially dissociate and both the acid and its conjugate base are present in the solution at equilibrium. The ease of deprotonation is influenced by factors such as the polarity of the H-A bond and the size of atom A which determines the strength of the H-A bond.

Single/multi-select question: If \\"A man is hosing off a piece of machinery.\\", can we conclude \\"A man is rinsing machinery.\\"? Pick from: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"A). Yes This question is asking whether we can conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the information that \\"A man is hosing off a piece of machinery.\\" In order to break down the statement and understand the underlying meaning, let's analyze the relevant words and phrases in both sentences. 1. \\"A man is hosing off\\" and \\"A man is rinsing\\": In both sentences, the subject and action remain the same - a man is doing something to a piece of machinery or machinery in general. The difference lies in the verbs: \\"hosing off\\" vs \\"rinsing.\\" The term \\"hosing off\\" implies that the man is using a hose to spray water on the machinery for cleaning it. \\"Rinsing\\" implies the use of water to cleanse or wash, but it is not specific about the source of water or the method of action. However, in the context of cleaning machinery, it can be reasonably inferred that both phrases convey similar actions where water is being used to clean the machinery. 2. \\"A piece of machinery\\" and \\"machinery\\": The main difference in these phrases is the specificity. \\"A piece of machinery\\" refers to a single, specific item or unit of machinery, whereas \\"machinery\\" can refer to one or multiple machines, or even machinery as a concept. Since we know that the man is working on a single piece of machinery, it is reasonably inferred that the single piece he is working on falls under the broader category of \\"machinery\\" in general. By analyzing and understanding the similarities and differences between the sentences, we can determine whether or not it's possible to conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the given information. In this case, the actions in both sentences (hosing off and rinsing) closely align in meaning, as both involve the use of water to clean machinery, and the specific piece of machinery in question is still a part of the broader concept of \\"machinery\\". Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that \\"A man is rinsing machinery\\" based on the given information. So, the answer is A). Yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Warren Gatland is coaching the Lions with Rob Howley one of his assistants, so regular forwards coach Robin McBryde is in charge of Wales for the matches against Tonga in Auckland on 16 June and Samoa in Apia a week later. With 12 senior internationals, including captain Alun Wyn Jones on Lions duty, and a number of players such as experienced prop Gethin Jenkins forced to withdraw injured, McBryde has been forced to call upon less familiar faces. Media playback is not supported on this device The 46-year-old has 14 uncapped players in his 32-man squad, all aiming to make the grade at international level. Seven uncapped players were named in Wales' Six Nations squad - rewarded for promising domestic displays - but none of them were involved in any match-day 23. Just three players - Ellis Jenkins, Cory Hill and Sam Davies - have won first caps since the 2015 World Cup. Wales' coaches have received criticism for that, accused of relying on the same old faces and not giving new players chances to shine. The matches against Tonga and Samoa offer perfect opportunities for the likes of Ospreys wing Keelan Giles, Wasps flanker Thomas Young and Gloucester bound fly-half Owen Williams. Only three of the players who featured under McBryde four years ago when Wales headed to Japan for two Tests - Liam Williams, Dan Biggar and Scott Baldwin - were involved in the 2017 Six Nations. With preparations already well underway for the 2019 World Cup in Japan, the aim for Wales will be to head there with a squad of experienced international stars, rather than relying too much on a starting side that has brought success to Welsh rugby under Gatland. This tour, though, is without doubt a tough test for McBryde's inexperienced squad, with Welsh wins rare down under. Samoa are clearly capable of mixing it with the game's best, while Tonga have the potential to be much more than just a nuisance as they proved last year in beating Italy 19-17 in Padova. Tonga will not have 'home advantage' - as their Teufaiva Sport Stadium in Nuku'alofa is being redeveloped - they will undoubtedly have plenty of support in Auckland. Still, Wales have never lost to Tonga in seven previous meetings and it would be a shock were they to suffer a first defeat on Friday. A week later McBryde's squad visit Apia to take on Samoa, who have a history of inflicting humiliating defeats on Wales. Media playback is not supported on this device Samoa have won four of the nine matches between the two sides, including famous World Cup wins in 1991 and 1999 as well as a comfortable 34-9 victory at home in Apia the last time Wales toured the Pacific Islands in 1994. New Zealand were the last tier-one nation to visit and were pushed to the limit by a fired-up Samoa, before holding on for a 25-16 victory in 2015. It was ample proof that the small country deserves to be recognised as a force in the global game and worthy of more visits from the elite. It may sound like a nice way to end the season for Wales. History, though, suggests otherwise. Wales squad: Prop: Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Wyn Jones (Scarlets), Gareth Thomas (Ospreys), Tomas Francis (Exeter Chiefs), Rhodri Jones (Ospreys), Dillon Lewis (Cardiff Blues).

Usually, there are some really good players who play for Wales. But some of them can't play because they are either busy with another team or they are injured. So, Coach McBryde is picking new players, who haven't played much before, to be a part of the team.

Jobs Data Show Steady Gains, but Stagnant Wages Temper Optimism Only days after many voters complained of worsening economic prospects, the new employment report from the government on Friday provided fresh evidence that the economy was actually getting better, with a sizable jump in the number of people saying they found a job last month. The Labor Department estimated that employers added 214,000 jobs in October, and the official unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 percent, down sharply from 7.2 percent a year ago. The increase in payrolls — combined with a revision that added 31,000 jobs to previous reports from August and September — put the average monthly job gain for the last six months at about 235,000. That pace, several analysts said, indicated that the economy was gathering momentum. But the report also found that wages were rising only slightly faster than the rate of inflation, fueling the debate over just how strong the labor market really is. Over the last 12 months, wages are up just 2 percent, which helps explain much of the disconnect between increasingly cheery assessments from many economists and the public’s continuing discontent. Speaking before a cabinet meeting, President Obama said that the economy had experienced the strongest job growth since the 1990s, and that the unemployment rate was at a six-year low. “We are adding jobs, but it is still a wageless recovery,” Elise Gould, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said, adding that average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in October after no gain in September. “The economy may be growing, but not enough for workers to feel the effects in their paychecks.” Many economists nonetheless found plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future. The number of people walking away from the labor market has halted, while the average number of hours worked ticked up. And a survey of households, though generally considered less reliable than figures gathered from employers, found that more than 683,000 people had been hired into a new job last month. “Labor force participation actually rose” to 62.8 percent, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, who noted that the drop in unemployment was not simply a result of people dropping out of the work force. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers or those stuck with only part-time work dropped to 11.5 percent, down more than 2 percentage points from the seasonally adjusted figure from a year ago. The headway on jobs can be seen as validation of the Federal Reserve’s decision to end its bond-buying campaign last month, while the lack of wage growth is likely to add caution to the Fed’s considerations over when to raise interest rates next year. “I’m not thinking we’re behind the curve,” Loretta J. Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, meaning that the latest jobs numbers had not convinced her that the Fed should move more quickly. October Jobs data show solid employment growth. Some analysts counseled patience on the wage front, predicting that the strengthening job market would soon translate into tangible increases. “We think this is a very strong report,” said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays. “We will see wage gains going forward. They just didn’t show up in this report.” Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Labor Department’s figures might not reveal all the progress that has been made. “The employment cost index is a much more comprehensive measure of wage growth, on which the Fed has traditionally put more weight,” he noted, concluding that “it shows a very clear acceleration in wage growth” over the last six months. Perhaps, but as Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez pointed out, what people care about is their weekly paycheck. “Wages are what matter to living standards,” he said. Mr. Perez noted that workers had benefited from few of the gains in productivity in recent decades. “Sweat equity isn’t translating into financial equity, even while the C.E.O.s of those companies are reaping dramatic rewards,” he said. “That’s the angst and frustration that I see across this country.” While the recovery from the recession is in its sixth year, stagnant wages and the wide gap between the rewards for those at the top of the income ladder and for ordinary workers have left many people disenchanted with their economic prospects. Election Day exit polls found that 78 percent of those surveyed were very or somewhat worried about the future of the economy, while two-thirds said they believed the economy was getting worse. The lack of wage growth, particularly at the bottom, helps explain why ballot measures aimed at increasing the minimum wage in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, Illinois and South Dakota all passed despite widespread losses in those states among Democrats who supported such measures. “It may seem counterintuitive that wages and salaries are growing the slowest in industries where jobs are growing the fastest,” LaVaughn M. Henry noted in an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Cincinnati Branch, “but it actually is not.” Because many of the new jobs in the leisure, hospitality and retail industries require little training or credentials, he explained, there is little pressure to raise wages. Low-paying leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for nearly one in eight new jobs created in the past year, economists at IHS Global Insight noted, while many of the newly reported hires were teenagers. There were also racial disparities in the job gains, with whites experiencing an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent compared with 10.9 percent for blacks and 6.8 percent for Hispanics. The persistent problem of long-term unemployment showed no signs of improvement this month, with 2.9 million people out of work for 27 weeks or more. This group accounts for about a third of those without jobs. Even the gloomiest assessments, however, acknowledged that no matter how tepid one might think the recovery is, the United States is still far outpacing Europe. Six years after a debt crisis hit the continent, unemployment in the European Union has edged down only slightly to 11.5 percent from a peak of 12 percent last year. It is nowhere near returning to precrisis levels of around 7 percent. There are other signs of the American economy’s strength. Over the last 12 months, according to a report released on Wednesday, the number of bankruptcy cases filed in federal courts dropped 13 percent to 963,739, the lowest since the 2007 fiscal year. And consumers, encouraged by falling gasoline prices, are more upbeat about job prospects than at any time in the last six years. Many of the strongest jobs gains were in service industries, created by small-business employers like Matthew Saravay, who runs Wizard Studios, a special-event production company in Brooklyn. “We’ve never been busier,” Mr. Saravay said. “I have interviews lined up, trying to keep up with the clamor of opportunity. We’re seeing holiday parties return in a way I haven’t seen in seven or eight years.” Steve Roesner, president and chief operating officer of Quatro Composites in Iowa, which produces structures for manufacturers in the aerospace industry, said he hired 100 new workers this year, bringing the company’s total staff to 220. He expects to further increase his work force by 20 percent next year. “In our industry, there’s a lot of optimism,” Mr. Roesner said. Looking ahead, Tara M. Sinclair, an economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation’s largest sites for job postings, said she had noticed particularly strong growth in the retail and transportation sectors. “It definitely looks like things are slowly moving in the right direction,” she said.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube. What did the author feel for his daughter? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. Disgust C. Fear D. Love The answer is:","completion":"D. Love In the narrative, the author mentions his feelings for his daughter explicitly when he says, \\"Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.\\" This statement indicates he cherishes his daughter and loves being a parent, which directly relates to the option D. Love. His feelings for his daughter are filled with affection and love, and he expresses no sentiments of disgust or fear toward her, ruling out options B. Disgust and C. Fear. Furthermore, the information on his feelings for his daughter is explicitly stated, which rules out the option A. not enough information. Thus, based on the text, the author's feelings for his daughter are full of love, and he highly values the fact that he is a parent, inspite of the complex and challenging journey he has faced with his sexuality and personal relationships. Through the trials of his personal journey he has maintained a strong bond and love for his daughter, showing the significance of this relationship in his life. He used the word \\"love\\" to describe his emotions towards his daughter, which suggests this is an enduring and strong feeling. Therefore, it's clear that love is the dominant and prevailing feelings the author holds for his daughter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which restaurant focuses more on just pizza, Valentino's and Imo's Pizza? A:","completion":"Step 1: Gather information about each restaurant To determine which restaurant focuses more on just pizza, I will start by researching the menus and backgrounds of both Valentino's and Imo's Pizza. Step 2: Examine the menu offerings I will carefully analyze the menu offerings of both restaurants to determine the proportion and focus on pizza compared to other food items. Valentino's menu: I find that Valentino's offers a variety of pizzas, pasta, sandwiches, seafood, and desserts. While they do have a wide range of pizzas, there are also significant non-pizza options on their menu. Imo's Pizza menu: I find that Imo's Pizza also offers a variety of pizzas, along with salads, sandwiches, pasta, and appetizers. While pizza is the main focus, they also have various non-pizza options. Step 3: Compare pizza options To compare the focus on pizza between the two restaurants, we must assess the number and variety of pizza choices. Valentino's pizza options: I find that Valentino's offers a range of specialty pizzas and allows for custom toppings, giving customers a good variety of pizza choices. Imo's Pizza options: I find that Imo's Pizza also offers a range of specialty pizzas and custom toppings, emphasizing their focus on pizza. Step 4: Analyze other factors Now, I will consider any other factors that could influence my conclusion, such as customer reviews or restaurant history. Valentino's background: I find that Valentino's has been offering Italian cuisine since 1957, indicating a strong history rooted in Italian food, potentially favoring a more diverse menu. Imo's Pizza background: I find that Imo's Pizza has been in business since 1964 and primarily focuses on St. Louis-style pizza, perhaps suggesting a stronger focus on pizza. Step 5: Draw a conclusion Based on the analysis of menus, pizza options, and restaurant history, it appears that while both Valentino's and Imo's Pizza have a range of non-pizza offerings, Imo's Pizza may have a slightly stronger focus on pizza due to their history and dedication to St. Louis-style pizza. However, the difference in focus is not significantly pronounced, as both offer a variety of pizzas and other dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City in 1952. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009. In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with his writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite Dreams reported that the new project was titled The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In October 2007, Dreams confirmed that this would be Gilliam's next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits. Production began in December 2007 in London. On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. Variety reported that Ledger's involvement had been a \\"key factor\\" in the film's financing. Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January, but in February the actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledger's role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the \\"magical\\" world of the film. Thanks to this arrangement the principal photography was completed on 15 April 2008, on schedule. Editing was completed in November 2008. According to the official ParnassusFilm Twitter channel launched on 30 March 2009, the film's post-production FX work finished on 31 March. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and suffered a broken back. The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009 but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this 30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than 60 million in worldwide theatrical release and received two Academy Award nominations.

Summarize this article: Stomach discomfort, including ulcers, may contribute to some horses' desire to crib. By switching to a diet that helps reduce ulcers, such as alfalfa hay, you may help eliminate stomach problems, which in turn, may reduce the horse's cribbing. If your horse is already on alfalfa, you may want to try other options for reducing cribbing. Change your horse's diet over slowly. Begin mixing some of the new diet in with the old a little at a time, gradually adding more each day. That will help reduce digestive issues. If you suspect that ulcers are causing your horse's cribbing, it's best to get your veterinarian to do a scope of its stomach to get a proper diagnosis. If ulcers are present, your vet can provide you with treatment options and ways to manage the ulcers, which will help heal your horse and reduce the cribbing. Sugary feeds may encourage your horse to crib more, so opt for a low-sugar version, like plain oats, when you're feeding grains in addition to hay. It may be that sugar lights up the same reward center in the brain that cribbing does, so when your horse gets sugar, it may want to keep the feeling going. Look for feeds that have a higher percentage of fat and fiber rather than starch and sugar. You can also try giving the horse hay before you feed it grain, which may cut down on cribbing, as well. If a horse has something to keep its mouth occupied, namely hay or a large pasture for grazing, it's less likely to crib. By having hay around, you encourage the horse to nibble on the hay throughout the day instead of inappropriate things like your barn or your fences. If your horse has trouble with overeating, try a slow feeder. These feeders give your horse a little bit of hay at a time, slowing down how much it can take, but your horse will still be nibbling most of the time. Because stomach discomfort may contribute to cribbing, have your horse seen by the vet if you haven't already. That way, the vet can rule out any stomach problems, such as ulcers or other intestinal issues, that you'll want to get taken care of. Your vet may suggest an antacid for certain conditions. If your horse doesn't have a stomach problem and cribbing has been a chronic problem, your vet may suggest having surgery to help prevent cribbing.","completion":"The article discusses how stomach discomfort and ulcers may be a contributing factor to a horse's desire to crib. To address this issue, it is suggested to switch the horse's diet to one that reduces the risk of ulcers, such as alfalfa hay. If the horse is already on an alfalfa diet, other options for reducing cribbing should be explored. It is essential to change the horse's diet gradually to avoid digestive issues. This can be done by slowly mixing the new diet with the old one, increasing the proportions of the new diet incrementally. If ulcers are suspected as the cause of cribbing, having a veterinarian perform a stomach scope is crucial to obtaining a proper diagnosis. If ulcers are detected, the vet can recommend treatment options and management strategies to heal the horse and reduce cribbing behavior. Sugary feeds should be avoided, as they may encourage cribbing in horses. Instead, opt for low-sugar options, such as plain oats, when feeding grains in addition to hay. Feeds with higher fat and fiber content, rather than starch and sugar, are preferable. Providing hay before feeding grain to the horse may also help in reducing cribbing. Providing ample hay or a large grazing area for the horse is important, as it keeps the horse's mouth occupied and reduces the likelihood of cribbing. Implementing a slow feeder can be helpful if a horse tends to overeat, as it allows the horse to nibble on hay throughout the day instead of indulging in inappropriate behavior like chewing on barns or fences. Lastly, consulting a veterinarian is vital to rule out any stomach issues, such as ulcers or intestinal problems, which may be causing the horse to crib. The vet may suggest antacids for specific conditions or recommend surgery if cribbing has been a long-term problem and no stomach issues are detected. Overall, addressing stomach discomfort, altering the horse's diet, and providing ample hay or grazing opportunities may significantly help reduce cribbing behavior in horses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As per the passage, not all woods exhibit similar characteristics in their growth rings, and these characteristics can change based on the type of wood. Commonly, the part of a growth ring that is closest to the center of the tree, known as earlywood or springwood, is formed early in the growing season when the growth rate is rapid. This portion is often composed of wider elements and tends to be lighter in color than the outer portion of the ring.

Bonus: Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive of Barclays, is set to receive a bonus of £1 million. Barclays triggered outrage last night as it emerged it plans to pay its new boss a £1million bonus despite being engulfed in scandal last year. Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive at the end of August with a brief to clean up the bank’s image, is being lined up for a seven-figure payout on top of his £1.1million salary. However, critics say Barclays should not pay such big bonuses for 2012 – a year when its name was dragged through the mud. In total, it is thought the bank is preparing to pay up to £2billion in bonuses for the last financial year. But Barclays was forced to cough up £290million over its involvement in the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal – a humiliating episode which cost Mr Diamond his job. It has also been accused of aggressive tax avoidance and mis-selling products such as payment protection insurance to unsuspecting customers. The row over bonuses at Barclays came a day after it emerged that RBS was planning to pay its investment bankers £250million for 2012, despite being more than 80 per cent owned by taxpayers. Critics reacted with anger to the prospect of another round of bumper bonuses following a year of shame for the industry. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: ‘Recent scandals have decimated consumer confidence, and the public will be rightly outraged if senior bankers get huge bonuses despite their failings. Cleanup: Mr Jenkins, who previously ran the Barclays retail banking arm and the credit cards division Barclaycard, was appointed chief executive to clean up the bank's tarnished image. Mega pay: Mr Jenkins's pay pales in comparison to Diamond's, who earned £17 million in 2011. ‘Excessive bonuses shouldn’t even be. contemplated where there is evidence of mis-selling or rate-rigging. Past bonuses should be clawed back from those who presided over. wrongdoing.’ Mr Jenkins was appointed as a ‘new. broom’ after the bank plunged into crisis under Mr Diamond. As chief. executive, his total package will be up to £8.6million, including a. salary of £1.1million, a bonus of up to £2.75million, shares in an. incentive plan worth up to £4.4million and a cash allowance of £363,000. instead of a pension. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a shadow. Treasury minister, said: ‘While our economy is shrinking it looks set to. be another bumper bonus round for bankers. 'There should be fair rewards for performance, but these bonuses follow the Libor fixing and mis-selling scandals.’ Reward: It is thought the bank is preparing to pay a total of between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in bonuses to its staff for 2012. Barclays sources insisted no decisions on bonuses have been taken and insisted pay is ‘something we want to bring down’. The bank paid out a total of £2.2billion in bonuses for 2011. MPs were told yesterday that a. generation of young people are being put off saving because of the. record-low base interest rate of 0.5 per cent. Experts also savaged the Bank’s. £375billion quantitative-easing policy, with one telling the Treasury. Select Committee that it was ‘an appalling confiscation of wealth’ from. pensioners. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The article, published on January 29, 2013, focuses on the controversy surrounding Barclays' plan to award its then-new CEO, Antony Jenkins, a £1 million bonus in addition to his £1.1 million salary.

The scandal resulted in previous CEO Bob Diamond losing his position. Barclays was preparing to pay up to £2 billion in bonuses for the last financial year, while the bank had to pay a £290 million fine for its involvement in the Libor scandal. The article also mentions RBS, planning to pay its investment bankers £250 million for 2012, despite being more than 80% owned by taxpayers. Critics and public figures expressed concern and outrage over the excessive bonuses following a year of tarnished reputations within the banking industry. At the time of the article's publication, Barclays sources asserted that no decisions on bonuses had been finalized and stated that they aimed to reduce future payouts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Anwar al-Awlaki was killed exactly one week after President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned to Yemen at the end of a long period of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Intelligence analysts say that may have been no coincidence, and that with al-Awlaki's killing, Saleh is underlining to the West -- and the Saudis -- that they still need him. Saleh's return was something of a surprise both to Yemenis and the international community. He had been seen as the main stumbling block to political dialogue and a transition to fresh elections sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation Council. But several analysts consulted by CNN said the Saudis were concerned that the growing unrest in Yemen could morph into outright civil war -- in a country that shares a long and porous desert border with the kingdom.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together. Vlad was a geologist and studied earthquakes. Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night. Which friend studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials?

Choices: - milk machine - farmyard - countryside - fairgrounds - long horns The rationale to choose \\"countryside\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The cows longed for the countryside. Rationale: Cows are domesticated animals primarily raised for agricultural purposes, such as providing milk and meat. They naturally thrive in rural settings, where they have ample space for grazing, roaming, and socializing with other cows. In the city, they face noise pollution, confined spaces, and an unfamiliar environment that can cause them stress and discomfort. Given this context, the cows would naturally long for their typical habitat, which is the countryside. Here's a brief overview of the other choices: - Milk machine: This is a device used to extract milk from cows, not a place for the cows to prefer or an environment they could long for. - Farmyard: While cows may be more comfortable in a farmyard compared to a city, the term \\"farmyard\\" specifically refers to the area where farm buildings and structures are located, not the pasture or grazing areas where the cows would typically spend their time. - Fairgrounds: This is a place where fairs, carnivals, or exhibitions are held. It is not the usual habitat for cows, so it's not what they would long for when lost in a city. - Long horns: This refers to the long and curved pair of horns found in some cattle breeds, such as the Texas Longhorn. However, long horns are a physical characteristic, not a location or environment, so it doesn't fit the context of the question. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"countryside\\" is that it's the most natural and appropriate environment for cows where they can roam freely, graze, and socialize without the stress and discomfort they experience in the noisy city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an in-depth analysis of how successful people say no. 1. Assess the situation: Before deciding if they should say no, successful people first evaluate the request, considering factors such as time, relevance to their goals, and the level of commitment required. This analysis helps them determine if their involvement aligns with their priorities. 2. Be clear and direct: Successful people understand that being straightforward is the most effective approach since it minimizes confusion and misinterpretation. They express their stance without ambiguity or hesitation. 3. Be respectful and tactful: Rejecting a request or declining an invitation doesn't mean being impolite or inconsiderate. Successful people say \\"no\\" politely and respectfully, showing empathy and understanding while asserting their boundaries. 4. Offer an explanation (if appropriate): Providing a brief, honest explanation can help others understand why they are unable to commit. This transparency helps maintain trust and credibility while still declining the request. 5. Suggest alternatives: If possible, successful people might propose alternative solutions or resources that could help the requester. This way, they demonstrate that they are not disregarding the issue entirely, just declining personal involvement. 6. Stand firm, but be flexible: Flexible people know how to navigate conflicting demands and priorities by asserting their boundaries while remaining open to negotiation.

The second question, \\"do successful people say no,\\" explores whether successful people use the concept of saying no as a part of their overall approach to managing commitments, time, and resources.

So, the logical and most fitting answer is 'secondary growth,' a term used to explain how plants expand their girth during their lifecycle—an event common in gymnosperm and many eudicot species. This approach looked at the most fitting answer based on a biological understanding of the question and the provided answer choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The encounter touched the hearts of the local community, and Kayleigh has chosen to spread her newfound fortune by using the money to visit her mother in North Wales over the Christmas holidays. On an otherwise ordinary day, Kayleigh Moran, a resident of Ashton, had just finished her shopping when she was stopped by an elderly man, believed to be in his 70s. The gentleman handed her an envelope, instructing her to open it only once he was out of sight. Unsure of what to make of the situation, Kayleigh followed his instructions and opened the envelope after the gentleman had discreetly left the scene. To her surprise and delight, the envelope contained a card along with £200 in cash. Stunned by the unexpected and heartwarming gesture, Kayleigh found herself searching for answers to the questions that sprung to her mind – Who was this man? What motivated him to offer such generosity to a complete stranger? Unfortunately, the generous man has yet to be identified, leaving a sense of mystery and wonder surrounding this act of kindness. Kayleigh has decided to pay it forward by using the gifted money to visit her mother over the Christmas holidays. The two women have not seen each other in some time due to the challenges brought on by the pandemic, which makes this seemingly minor act of kindness feel even more significant. In a time when the world seems full of uncertainties, this simple and kind gesture has had a profound impact on those who have learned of the story. It has also sparked a renewed sense of community spirit and goodwill, inspiring others to find ways to pay it forward and bring joy to those around them. As the search for the identity of the generous stranger continues, anyone with information about this unique encounter is encouraged to email claire.carter@mailonline.co.uk. The hope is that this heartwarming story will not only provide local residents with an uplifting reminder of the goodness that still exists in our world, but also inspire others to engage in their own acts of kindness – however big or small – during this challenging time. Regardless of whether the identity of the kindhearted stranger is ever discovered, his act of selfless generosity has brought about a ripple effect of warmth and kindness, proving that even in the most ordinary of moments, human compassion and generosity can create a lasting impact on the lives of others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you provided pertains to the history of country music in Tennessee, not how it became a state. Tennessee became a state on June 1, 1796, when it was admitted as the 16th state in the union. The process of statehood began with the signing of the Treaty of Holston between the United States and the Cherokee people in 1791, which opened up the territory for settlement. The Southwest Territory, which included most of modern-day Tennessee, was established in 1790 under the administration of President George Washington and led by Territorial Governor William Blount. As the population in this territory grew, demands for statehood increased. In 1795, a census determined that the Southwest Territory had achieved the population requirement of 60,000 free inhabitants, making it eligible for statehood under the rules of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. A constitutional convention was held in Knoxville in January 1796, during which delegates drafted a state constitution and selected John Sevier as the first governor of Tennessee. The drafted constitution was submitted to the United States Congress for approval, and after a few minor adjustments, President George Washington signed the bill admitting Tennessee to the Union on June 1, 1796. So, Tennessee became a state due to a combination of increased settlement, population growth, and the successful establishment of a state government under the guidelines provided by the United States Congress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

Write an article based on this summary: Measure the size of your locket’s image space, if possible. Estimate the size of your image space, if difficult to measure. Measure the diameter instead of the width if your locket is round. Article:","completion":"# Crafting the Perfect Memory: Sizing Your Locket's Image Space A locket is a classic piece of jewelry that carries a unique sentiment, as it serves as a personal treasure chest for precious memories. Inside its compact frame, you can store a photograph of your loved ones, encapsulating a moment in time with just a glance. However, fitting the right photo size for your locket requires some effort. This article will guide you on how to measure the size of your locket's image space and help you create the perfect personalized keepsake. Step 1: Assess the Locket's Image Space Accessibility Before you get started, determine whether the image space in your locket can be measured with ease. Some lockets have removable frames, making it simple to measure accurately. In contrast, others might have a rigid or uniquely shaped frame that makes measurement difficult. If you're unsure, take a closer look and decide if your locket falls into the easy or complicated category for measuring. Step 2: Measure the Size of Your Locket's Image Space Once you have assessed the accessibility of your locket's image space, the next step is to measure it. For this, you'll need a ruler or an electronic caliper for better accuracy. # Easy-to-Measure Lockets If your locket has a removable frame, carefully open it and take the frame out. Lay the frame down on a flat surface and measure its dimensions using the ruler or caliper. Record the width and height of the frame, which determines the size of the photograph that will fit in your locket. # Difficult-to-Measure Lockets If your locket is challenging to measure due to its design or accessibility, follow these steps to estimate the image space: 1. First, close your locket and measure the diameter if it's round or the width and height if it's a different shape. 2. Open the locket and compare the interior edges to the dimensions you just measured. 3. Adjust your measurements accordingly if the interior space is smaller than the external dimensions. 4. Keep in mind that you might have to adjust your photo's size slightly once it's placed inside the locket. Step 3: Select the Right Sized Photo and Place it in Your Locket After measuring the dimensions of your locket's image space, choose a photograph that can be resized to fit perfectly. Use photo-editing software or consult a professional to resize your selected image according to the measurements obtained. Print the resized photograph on photographic paper, and carefully cut it to size using scissors or a paper cutter. Now that you have the perfectly sized photo, open your locket and gently place the picture inside the frame. If you have a removable frame, insert it back into the locket. Make any final adjustments to ensure the photo sits snugly within the confines of the locket before closing it securely. And there you have it – your locket, a treasure trove of memories, is now complete with a perfectly fitted photo. Follow these steps to craft your personalized keepsake and keep your cherished memories close to your heart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sun Tzu's \\"The Art of War\\" is central to the game; its precepts quoted often and its strategies recommended. - Vikings (Danish and ; Swedish and ), from Old Norse \\"\\", were Nordic seafarers, mainly speaking the Old Norse language, who raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of northern, central and eastern Europe, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries. The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to the inhabitants of Viking home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age. This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, Estonia, the British Isles, France, Kievan Rus' and Sicily. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - West Sussex is a county in the south of England, bordering East Sussex (with Brighton and Hove) to the east, Hampshire to the west and Surrey to the north, and to the south the English Channel. Chichester in the southwest is the county town and only city in West Sussex, with the largest towns being Crawley, Worthing and Horsham. West Sussex has a range of scenery, including wealden, downland and coastal. The highest point of the county is Blackdown, at 280 metres (919 ft). It has a number of stately homes including Goodwood, Petworth House and Uppark and also castles such as Arundel Castle and Bramber Castle. Over half the county is protected countryside, offering walking, cycling and other recreational opportunities. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude.

Originally announced in August 2001, the game was released in North America on 19 August 2002 and in Europe on 30 August for Microsoft Windows. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Trump probably is: Options: - enemies with Trudeau - Allies with Trudeau - not enough information - allies with Clinton","completion":"After the end of this story, Trump is probably allies with Trudeau. Although they had disagreements over trade policies and tariffs, Trump allegedly joked about Trudeau agreeing to cut tariffs and described their cross-border relationship as very good.

They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. In which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster? A:","completion":"In the given scenario, Justin and Thomas are conducting experiments in their chemistry laboratory course by mixing acids and bases to produce sodium-based compounds. The primary difference between their experiments is the temperature at which they are conducting the reactions. It is crucial to understand how temperature affects the motion of particles in a reaction. The movement of particles is directly influenced by an increase or decrease in temperature. The kinetic molecular theory states that particles possess kinetic energy, which increases with increasing temperature. This higher kinetic energy allows the particles to move more rapidly, which, in turn, allows them to collide more frequently. In this case, Justin is conducting his reactions at a higher temperature compared to Thomas. Consequently, the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will possess greater kinetic energy due to the higher temperature. As a result, these particles will move faster, leading to increased frequency of collisions between the molecules. Comparatively, the particles in Thomas's reaction will have relatively lower kinetic energy because of the lower temperature at which his reaction takes place. The acid and base particles in Thomas's reaction will move comparatively slower than those in Justin's reaction, resulting in fewer collisions between the molecules. Therefore, based on the given information and applying the principles of the kinetic molecular theory, the acid and base particles will move faster in Justin's reaction due to the higher temperature at which he conducts his experiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Police Story 2 Context: Inspector Chan Ka-kui has been demoted to highway patrol as the result of his handling of his previous case, which involved the violent arrest of crime lord Chu Tao and heavy property damage. The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her. However, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he has been released from prison, and while he is still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui. John Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka-Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her mother are beaten by John Ko and his men. Ka-Kui can no longer hold back, and he lashes out against John Ko and his men at a restaurant. Ashamed of his behavior, Ka-Kui resigns from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. He plans to take a trip to Bali with May, but while he is at a travel agency in a shopping mall, some police officers see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat. Unable to resist the urge to get involved in police work, Ka-Kui tells the officers to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared, and agrees to take responsibility for the decision. A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast. Ka-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try to learn more about the bombers. This leads to a suspect who is a deaf-mute and is a fierce martial artist and explosives expert. The bombing gang, aware that the police are on to them, plan a simultaneous bombing of the property company and the police headquarters. They double their ransom demand to 20 million and kidnap May, luring Ka-Kui into a trap in which he is strapped with an explosive vest and forced to pick up the extortion money from the... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Police Story 2,\\" the ransom demand for May is initially not mentioned explicitly. However, when the bombing gang becomes aware that the police are on to them, they double their initial ransom demand to 20 million. Considering that their initial ransom demand was for 10 million and they later doubled it to 20 million, the specific ransom amount for May can be inferred as 10 million. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the initial ransom demand was for her safety, and when the crime gang doubled their demand for the simultaneous bombings of the property company and the police headquarters, they also included May's security in the increased amount."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border.

A strong woman oriented subject after long, director Krishna Vamsi's Shakti- The Power, the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi's first home-production. A story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice. The story of the film revolves around Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) who lives in Canada with her two uncles (Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti). There she meets Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), falls in love with him and they soon marry. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja (Master Jai Gidwani). But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhar's ailing mother (Deepti Naval)makes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. And that's when the problems start. From the moment they reach India, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. They take a crowded train to reach Shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive. And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhar''s father, Narsimha (Nana Patekar) lives with his wife (Deepti Naval). Nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome. Living there, Nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. The day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada. But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law. Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film. What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. The only drawback is Ismail Darbar''s music, which fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik. Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film. His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr-climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value. Though his role was not really required, he's done it well. Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.

Write a text based on this summary: hard-line foreign minister outlines views on palestinian statehood Text:","completion":"Title: Hard-Line Foreign Minister Presents Stance on Palestinian Statehood The hard-line foreign minister recently took the opportunity to express their comprehensive views on the long-standing issue of Palestinian statehood, particularly given the elevated tensions within the region. In a candid address, the minister emphasized the importance of addressing the complex challenges surrounding the future of the Palestinians, while maintaining a steadfast position on the safety and sovereignty of their country. The foreign minister acknowledged the historical complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which dates back to centuries of tensions and political clashes. The minister began their address by reiterating their commitment to ensuring peace and stability in the region, recognizing the need for a sustainable resolution to the ongoing strife. However, they asserted that lasting peace cannot be achieved without a mutual understanding and respect for the needs and aspirations of both Israeli and Palestinian people. To this end, the minister advocated for the establishment of a dialogue that enables candid discussions on the various solutions, emphasizing the importance of considering all legitimate options to address the Palestinian quest for self-determination. The minister argued that dialogue should not only involve governmental leaders but must also engage the voices and demands of Palestinian people, as well as encourage support and cooperation from the international community. Despite their clear advocacy for dialogue and discussion, the hard-line foreign minister expressed their concerns and reservations about the implications of granting full statehood to the Palestinians. They underscored the necessity of evaluating the potential consequences of statehood across numerous dimensions, including regional security, economic development, and political stability. The minister stressed that any potential solution should not undermine the territorial integrity and security of existing states, or give rise to further instability and conflicts in the region. Moreover, the foreign minister emphasized that the expansion of illegal settlements and the overall disregard of international law by some factions pose significant threats to achieving a harmonious coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. The minister called for strict adherence to international law and reaffirmed their commitment to working closely with regional and international partners to address such challenges effectively. The minister made clear that the pursuit of Palestinian statehood should not entail any compromises on substantial issues such as the security and well-being of Israeli citizens or the overall stability of the region. Yet, they also emphasized that the pursuit of peace requires dedication, transparency, and the willingness to explore multiple avenues to achieve lasting stability. In conclusion, the hard-line foreign minister communicated their concerns and outlined their views on the complex issue of Palestinian statehood. By advocating for open dialogue, adherence to international law, and a comprehensive approach to resolving conflicts, the minister demonstrated their commitment to preserving stability and peace in the region, while considering the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian people. Balancing these core principles is undoubtedly a challenging endeavor, but the foreign minister expressed hope that a long-lasting, equitable resolution can be achieved through collective efforts of all stakeholders involved in the peace process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water molecules split into oxygen happens, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves an increase in water molecules splitting into oxygen. This process, also known as water electrolysis, doesn't seem to have a direct effect on the recycling process of aluminum cans. However, there could be a potential indirect effect that we can consider: the increased production of oxygen from water electrolysis might result in an abundant availability of oxygen. Oxygen is required for the production of aluminum from its ore, bauxite, through a process called the Hall-Héroult process. If the electrolysis-generated oxygen were utilized in aluminum production, it might lead to a greater production of new aluminum. In turn, the increased availability of new aluminum could potentially reduce the demand for recycled aluminum. It's worth noting that this hypothesis is quite speculative, as aluminum recycling is an essential practice to save energy and resources regardless of oxygen availability, mainly because producing aluminum from recycled materials requires much less energy compared to producing it from bauxite ore. Additionally, water electrolysis-generated oxygen would need to be economically competitive and viable for use in aluminum production for it to have any significant effect on the aluminum recycling process. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on aluminum can recycling, there could be a potential indirect effect on the demand for recycled aluminum if oxygen generated from water electrolysis is used in aluminum production on a large scale. However, this scenario is speculative and would rely on several factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The turnover led to another Kansas City touchdown, and a 14-0 lead. Early in the second quarter, Tampa Bay drove into the red zone, and scored a field goal. On the following drive, the Chiefs executed a flea-flicker play and quarterback Tyler Thigpen caught an improbable 37-yard touchdown pass. Late in the second quarter, the Chiefs added a field goal, to stretch the lead to 24-3. On the ensuing kickoff, Clifton Smith scored a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown, the second such in franchise history. The Buccaneer defense held the Chiefs to a 3-and-out, and the offense took over with 1:08 to go. As time expired in the half, Matt Bryant's second field goal trimmed the deficit to 24-13. Neither team scored in the third quarter, and all drives ended in punts. Early in the fourth quarter, Jeff Garcia again drove Tampa Bay into the red zone.

With 3:34 to go, the Buccaneers drove to the Kansas City 3, and Earnest Graham appeared to be heading for a potential game-tying score. The ball was fumbled, however, and the Chiefs took over on a touchback. The Buccaneer defense forced a punt, and they took over with 1:50 to go. Jeff Garcia quickly drove the Buccaneers to a 25-yard touchdown, and a two-point conversion catch by Alex Smith sent the game to overtime. In the overtime period, Tampa Bay won the coin toss. They drove to the Kansas City 15-yard line, and Matt Bryant won the game on a 34-yard field goal. The victory marked the largest comeback (from 21 points behind to win) in franchise history.

Parents of Brit found in Spain SIX years after disappearing tell of joy at having him home MATTHEW Green, 31, was found at a mental health unit in Spain after vanishing from home in 2010 THE parents of a man who was found in Spain six years after he disappeared have told of their joy at having him home. Matthew Green, 31, disappeared from his home in Sittingbourne, Kent home in 2010 after telling his parents he was going to Mile End in London. SWNS - Bristol +44 (0)1179066550 SWNS - Bristol +44 (0)1179066550 The then 26-year-old never returned, leaving his heartbroken parents wrought with worry. Incredibly Pauline and Jim Green received a call in May to say their son had been found in Spain and was being treated at a mental health hospital. After an incredible outpour of support that saw thousands raised on GoFundMe to help the parents bring their son home, Matt is now back in the UK and being cared for in a special facility. Both parents flew out to Spain to see their son after more than half-a-decade apart before he was brought back to England. A tearful Pauline told This Morning: “He was walking towards us and I knew straight away it was Matt.” She said her son is still “very, very poorly” and faces a long road ahead but added: “There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.” Emotional Pauline told Holly Willougby and Phillip Scholfield the parents were advised to give Matthew space when he arrived back in the UK to let him adjust to the new situation. Pauline said: “He arrived on Wednesday and I phoned the hospital on Thursday to see if he was settling in and ask if they had started treatment.” The concerned mum was told they hadn’t started treatment yet as Matthew’s notes were all in Spanish, but this has now been sorted. She went on: “On the Friday I was pottering around when the house phone went, I answered and he just said ‘hello mum, it’s Matt’. “For six years all I’ve wanted was to hear his voice, to see him and it was just as if he had nipped down the road, or had just gone to the shops or something. “He was just phoning home. It was really, really strange – but lovely.” Matthew is currently placed under a section two, which lasts 28 days and gives him a chance to appeal the section if he wants. If a judge or panel decides he is okay, Matthew could be let out – but it is more likely the section two will be extended to a section two, which can last up to six months. Pauline said: “I know it sounds awful as we’re his mum and dad and we’d like him home obviously, but in the long-term he’s not well enough so six months is great. “I want them to keep him so I know where he is and that he’s safe and can have whatever treatment he needs.” Jim added: “I feel happy, elated we found him. I would like to thank the local community and all the people who have supported us for the money that was raised through GoFundMe, which went towards helping Matt get back home. “People have always said ‘if there’s anything we can do to help’, and I feel they have. It’s so wonderful, we’ve had this following with these people.” Pauline added: “I’ve finally been able to go to bed and sleep, I can have a full night now and it’s such a weight that’s been lifted. “He’s safe and getting the treatment he wants.” Jim added: “We know there are lots of people in the same situation as us and we’d say don’t give up, just keep going.” We pay for your stories!

Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region?","completion":"The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. This major religious and political development brought about significant changes in the region's socio-political dynamics. Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, using the process of ijtihad to find truth. This had real implications for governance, making all philosophy \\"political\\" in nature. Initially, the rationalist Mutazilite philosophers posed a challenge to this religious-based worldview, advocating for a more Hellenic view that placed reason above revelation. These philosophers were supported by secular aristocracy seeking greater freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. However, by the late ancient period, the traditionalist Asharite view of Islam, which held that reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna, had generally triumphed. The spread of Islam not only altered the religious landscape but also the political power balance. Muslim conquests led to the large-scale expansion of the Islamic Caliphate, absorbing former territories of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. Consequently, the power balance shifted towards the Islamic empire, fundamentally altering the political map of the Mediterranean region. These religious, philosophical, and political changes together brought about a new perception of origin of power in the Mediterranean. Islam became a critical force that reshaped the region's political, religious, and intellectual paradigms for centuries to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis?, using the article: On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house.

I have a new situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Before calculating net worth, it is important to know what it is, and its purpose. The easiest way to define net worth is that it is what you own, minus what you owe. Net worth is how much you would have left over if you were to take everything you own, sell it, and use the proceeds to pay off what you owe. Your net worth gives you a good idea of your overall wealth and the health of your financial situation. For example, if you have plenty of debt, and own very little, your net worth would be negative, which means your financial situation may not be healthy. This is because if you own a 1,000 computer for example, but owe 20,000 in debt, if you subtract what you owe (the debt) from what you own (the computer), you still owe 19,000. Because you owe 19,000, your net worth would be -19,000. On the other hand, if you own a home worth 100,000, a car worth 20,000, and have a 50,000 mortgage, your net worth would be a positive 70,000 (or 120,000 of assets minus your 50,000 mortgage liability). What you own is also known as your assets. This component of calculating net worth really is as simple — and possibly daunting — as making a dollar value estimate of everything you own, from the car you drive to the contents of your sock drawer. Don’t worry yet about determining the amount you owe on things like your house or car; that work will come with your liabilities. The focus now is on establishing the market value of your possessions. That is to say, how much your possessions would sell for if you were able to sell them today. Start your asset counting by making an outline with the following categories: Cash & Cash Equivalents. Investments Retirement Funds. Home. Home furnishings and valuables. Automobiles. Other. Cash is a type of asset. This includes the contents of your bank accounts (like checking, savings, or High Interest Savings Accounts), any physical cash you have on hand, or any cash in investment accounts. Let’s say, for example, that you have 3,000 in your checking account and 17,000 in your savings account, for a grand total of 20,000 in cash (running total: 20,000). Be careful not to count the value of investments as cash. For example, if you have a Roth IRA account with a mutual fund worth 5,000 in it, do not count that mutual fund as cash, because it is an investment. Perhaps your parents bought you a policy as a kid, or you signed up for one yourself or through work. If it is a whole life policy that builds cash value, then that cash value is part of your assets. If you own a whole life insurance policy, there are two values linked to it — cash value and face value. When you pay premiums, part of the premium goes to paying the cost of insurance, and the remainder goes into a cash fund. The value of the cash fund is known as the cash value. The face value is the amount your family receives if you were to die (or the cost of the insurance). If you were to close the policy early, you would receive the cash value. Count cash value — the amount you would receive if you closed out the policy — not the face value, as being an asset. The cash value of a whole life policy typically builds up slowly to the point where it equals the face value once you reach the end of the mortality table used to establish your policy (often at age 100). Whether you have a substantial portfolio or have just started investing, the current dollar value of such investments is another portion of your overall assets. Investments include things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds. Let’s imagine that you have 5,000 an investment account. This would give you a running total of 25,000 in assets. Note that running total simple means adding up everything we have so far, so 20,000 in cash plus 5,000 in investments equals 25,000 of total assets. As you are more than likely dealing with hypotheticals and not actually “cashing out” your assets, it is probably unnecessary to factor in any withdrawal penalties for removing funds from an investment account. But it can’t hurt to be familiar with the details of any penalties you may face in the future. If you have a defined contribution account with your employer, like a 401(k) or 403(b), or an individual retirement plan like an IRA or Roth IRA, these count towards your assets. These are separate from investments, as they cannot be easily liquidated. For example, imagine you have 15,000 in a 401(k) account with your employer. This bring your running asset total to 25,000 + 15,000, or 40,000. This is where things get a bit more speculative. Instead of counting up funds, you have to make a best guess about the value of what is likely your most valuable possession — your home. You need to establish the fair market value for your home — the amount you could expect to fetch for it if you put it on the market. The most common way to do so is by finding the sale prices for comparable properties, which are those similar in location, size, age, condition, style, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc. How to Determine Market Value for Your Home offers many ideas on identifying “comps” and establishing market value, including: consulting newspapers, real estate websites, and local tax offices/websites; talking with a real estate agent; and having an appraiser do the estimating for you. For this exercise, we will say that your home is valued at 150,000 (running total: 190,000). This is likely to involve even more speculating and estimating. You will probably be surprised by the amount you get, as the average single renter in the U.S. usually has 20,000–30,000 in such personal property. One of the best tips to estimate the value of things in your home is to search the item on Google.com or Kijiji.com to see what the used item is selling for on the market. This is a useful exercise not only for determining your net worth, but also for figuring out how much renter’s or homeowner’s insurance you should carry. Having a detailed list of your possessions — including photos, if possible — will also come in handy if you ever need to file a claim. For insurance purposes, you probably want to determine the replacement value for your things — what it would cost to actually replace them. For your net worth, however, you simply want to establish the market value — what someone would pay for them as is. For instance, you might be able to sell your five-year-old TV for 100, but replacing it with a comparable new one might cost 250. We’ll pretend your household possessions add up to 25,000, for a running total of 215,000. Be careful not to double-count anything. For example, you have already estimated the value of your home, therefore, you need to make sure that anything that was part of your home value is also not added to your list of valuables in your home. Generally speaking, if it is not staying in your home when you sell it, you can add it your list of valuables in your home. Again, this involves some guesswork, but thankfully there are numerous resources for establishing the market value for automobiles. The traditional “blue book” for car valuations is now more easily utilized online, along with many competing car valuation and/or car-buying sites. You can also ask a car dealer for an estimate; if he or she has any inkling that you may want to buy a car, a dealer will likely be happy to do this for you. For our sample running total, let’s add 25,000 for your car to make it 240,000. Remember if you own it, it is an asset. You may have some debt on that asset (like a car you borrowed money to own for example), but that debt will be subtracted later on in the net worth calculation. Don't forget to include the value of any business you may own for example, or any additional property (like a cottage).

Context: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

The word \\"Phubbing\\", which comes from \\"phone\\" and \\"snub\\", describes such behavior . With popularization of smart phones, we see a new \\"Phubbing\\" group everywhere in public places: in subway, restaurants, roads, people are checking the mobile phone, ignoring the people around completely. What is worrying us is that not only young people, but also the elderly and kids are getting addicted to Phubbing. On Dec 29th, a 28-year-old woman--a mother of two in Wenzhou, drowned after she fell into a river while looking at her mobile phone. A Pakistani man was killed on Dec 15th, 2015, after being hit by a fast moving train while trying to take a selfie with it on the track. Last month, Justin, a college student was shot in subway in San Francisco, the U.S. The surveillance video showed that before Justin was killed, the killer pulled out the gun several times, and even wiped his nose with it. However, nobody noticed that. The surrounding passengers all focused on their cell phones. Phone is the tool for communication, but now it distances people and makes them separated from each other. Therefore, someone jokes \\"the furthest distance in the world is not the distance between life and death, but that you don't know I stand in front of you while you focus on the mobile.\\" Phubbing appears harmless; however, it does affect our life. 23-year-old Alex from Melbourne wrote in his blog: \\"I can no longer focus on what I am eating since I started twittering. My skill of food photography has improved very fast, while my interest in food drops a lot as a result.\\" The author gives several examples in Para.2 to _ . A) show the phubbing people are dangerous. B) tell people the bad effects of phubbing C) say phubbing is more and more popular. D) warn people not to use phones any more. A:","completion":"The author gives several examples in Para.2 to B) tell people the bad effects of phubbing. Phubbing, as the combination of \\"phone\\" and \\"snub\\", has become an increasingly widespread phenomenon with the widespread use of smartphones. People of all ages, including the young, elderly, and children, are more engrossed in their phones than paying attention to their surroundings or engaging in face-to-face conversations. This behavior has led to numerous negative effects, as demonstrated by the examples in Paragraph 2. The first example mentions a 28-year-old woman who drowned after falling into a river while looking at her mobile phone, highlighting the potential physical dangers of phubbing and being oblivious to one's environment. The second example involves a Pakistani man who was hit by a train while trying to take a selfie on the track, emphasizing the potential consequences of prioritizing phone usage over personal safety. The third example recounts an incident where a college student was shot in the subway, and none of the surrounding passengers noticed the gunman due to their preoccupation with their phones. This illustrates how phubbing can make individuals more vulnerable to danger and less aware of potential threats. Apart from the physical dangers, the author also highlights the impact of phubbing on people's emotional well-being and personal interests. The 23-year-old Alex from Melbourne mentions in his blog that he can no longer focus on his food since he started using Twitter. Consequently, his interest in the actual food has diminished. This example shows how phubbing can affect interpersonal relationships and even personal interests, undermining individual connections and experiences. Therefore, the examples in paragraph 2 are meant to shed light on the various negative effects of phubbing, stressing the need to be aware of its potential consequences and encouraging people to reconsider how they engage with their smartphones in public spaces and during interpersonal interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Anatomy Lesson A Natural and Cultural History ''I FEAR,'' Nietzsche writes, ''that the animals regard man as a creature of their own kind which has in a highly dangerous fashion lost its healthy animal reason -- as the mad animal, as the laughing animal, as the weeping animal, as the unhappy animal.'' He might have added: as the belted animal. When dogs, cats or tigers burning in the jungle look upon us, surely what strikes them most forcibly is not that we walk upright, or even that we wear clothes, but that with few exceptions we are all cinctured at the waist, if only by the elastic in our drawers. This state of beltedness is one of the few oddities of the human condition that Michael Sims does not address in his compendious history of the body. Making a leisurely descent down the human frame from top to toe, he ignores the waist, although, as one would expect from the title of his book, he does pause long enough in the general vicinity to carry out an in-depth investigation of the bellybutton. Yes, there is lint here. Indeed, Karl Kruszelnicki, a professor of physics at the University of Sydney, is called upon to solve for us the ancient mystery of how so much fluff gets into the navel. According to this savant, it seems that ''abdominal hairs serve as a conveyor belt for transporting fibers upward from underwear'' and depositing them in the umbilicus. Yes, there are big words here, too. Sims is a journalist from Nashville who writes about cultural and scientific matters, and the author of ''Darwin's Orchestra: An Almanac of Nature in History and the Arts.'' Like many of the body parts that come under his scrutiny in ''Adam's Navel,'' he is a hangover from another age, yet well adapted to his own time. He has the breadth, if not the depth, of Montaigne or Robert Burton or Sir Thomas Browne, the whimsical omnivorousness of the 18th-century essayists, and he is as bigheartedly inclusive as Samuel Johnson, one of his particular heroes. The topics he considers range from the workings of the eye to Barbie's breasts, from the snake-hair of Medusa to ''The Vagina Monologues,'' from wet nurses to the ash from volcanoes in the Serengeti Plain, in which were preserved the 3.6-million-year-old bipedal prints of some of our earliest-known ancestors, Australopithecus afarensis. Nothing is too large or too small to merit Sims's attention, and nothing human disgusts him. He quotes from a medical text by Frederic Wood Jones treating of, among other podal matters, the hallux -- ''the technical term for the innermost digit on the hind limb of pentadactyl creatures'' -- in which the English anatomist bemoans the fact that ''the big toe lacks its champion.'' Not anymore. Sims describes ''Adam's Navel'' as ''something of a hybrid,'' which is something of an understatement. (Entering into the Simsian spirit, I cannot forbear to note the source of the word ''hybrid'' according to Chambers Dictionary: ''L. hybrida, offspring of a tame sow and wild boar.'') The book had its source in an accident that damaged one of Sims's cervical disks, leading to a diskectomy that forced him to lie immobile on his back for two weeks. In an understandably concentrated state of mind during this period of forced inactivity, he brooded much on the human body. Finding that he could balance a legal pad flat on his chest and write blind on it, afterward lifting the pad horizontal and deciphering the scribbles, he ''whiled away the hours scrawling free association under such headings as 'Ears' and 'Navel' and 'Toes,' '' and soon realized that his next book was under way. He decided from the start to concentrate on the outward form of the body, summoning to his support Oscar Wilde at his pithiest: ''The great mystery of the world is not the invisible, but the visible.'' Inner organs, therefore, are left to their dark and desperate business, while most of the outer body, from the hair, on head and elsewhere, to the hitherto unchampioned toes, is lovingly examined. True, Sims does make an occasional internal foray, into ears, mouth, nasal and other, nether, passages. He devotes a lively discussion to the first man's navel and how he might have acquired it, since he was not of woman born. He has some cheap but enjoyable fun at the expense of poor old Philip Henry Gosse, a zoologist who in 1857, two years before the publication of Darwin's ''Origin of Species,'' committed a work entitled ''Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot,'' in which he sought to counter evolutionary arguments by suggesting that the wily Lord created the world complete with such things as fossils in cliffs, rings in tree trunks and a navel in Adam's belly. Gosse's more famous son, Edmund, author of the progenitor-slaying ''Father and Son,'' said witheringly of ''Omphalos'' that his father ''offered it, with a glowing gesture, to atheists and Christians alike. . . . But, alas! atheists and Christians alike looked at it and laughed, and threw it away.'' BEFORE leaving navels, one cannot resist informing Sims, if he does not know it already, that Salvador Dalí, a closet coprophagist -- but then, what other kind could there be? -- prized, above all of his wife Gala's waste products, tiny particles of dirt that he delighted in extracting from the deepest folds of her bellybutton, and that he was convinced were not deposits from without, drawn upward, as Kruszelnicki teaches, by the delicate action of her stomach floss, but -- and one hopes this review is not being read at the breakfast table -- solidifications of a microscopic seepage from within. Brings a new resonance to the phrase ''consuming passion.'' This is an entertaining, witty and erudite jackdaw's nest of a book. Sims seems not only to have read everything, the trivial as well as the lofty, but to have remembered all of it. The range of reference is dizzying. If at times he sounds like the worst bore in the bar, he will quickly re-grab the reader's flagging attention with some new bizarre fact or fragment of arcana. He notes, for instance, that Dr. Johnson refused to name the private parts in his dictionary, an irony, given that ''johnson'' is now a widely accepted nickname for the penis, which in turn, as Sims's section heading on the subject acknowledges, gives a ribald extension to the notion of ''Boswell's Johnson'' that would have made the great man's randy biographer chuckle.

Answer the following question: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Which of the words can best describe The Time Company's attitude towards its announcement?

Question: who discovered the atom is mostly empty space?? Answer:","completion":"The discovery that the atom is mostly empty space came as a result of ground-breaking experiments conducted in the early 20th century, particularly from Sir Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment. However, understanding the discovery of the atom's structure involves looking at the combined contributions of several scientists. 1. J.J. Thomson (1856-1940): In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron through his experiments on cathode rays. He proposed the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom, in which electrons were scattered throughout a diffuse, positively charged sphere. During this time, it was believed that the atom was a solid mass. 2. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937): In 1909, New Zealand-born British physicist Ernest Rutherford, widely regarded as the father of nuclear physics, designed the gold foil experiment along with his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The experiment involved directing alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observing their scattering through a zinc sulfide screen. Rutherford expected the alpha particles to pass through the gold foil with minor deviations in their path due to interactions with the positively charged \\"plum pudding\\" atoms. To his surprise, some alpha particles were deflected at large angles, with a few bouncing almost directly backward. 3. Interpretation and conclusion: Rutherford realized that these unexpected results could only be explained if the atom's positively charged mass and most of its mass were concentrated in a tiny central region, which he called the nucleus. This implied that the majority of the atom's volume was empty space, featuring only the electrons orbiting around the nucleus at a relatively large distance. Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom succeeded in explaining the gold foil experiment's results, and the concept that atoms are mostly empty space became widely accepted in the scientific community. In the years that followed, other scientists built upon Rutherford's work, leading to Niels Bohr's planetary model in 1913, which incorporated new concepts of quantized energy levels for electrons. In summary, the discovery that the atom is mostly empty space is primarily credited to Ernest Rutherford, whose gold foil experiment provided evidence that directly challenged the prevailing \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom. Rutherford's work opened the door to our modern understanding of atomic structure and marked a significant milestone in the field of nuclear physics."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a goal: To clean up spilled nail polish. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Cleaning up spilled nail polish can be challenging, but with the right tools and approach, it can be accomplished efficiently and effectively. Here's a step-by-step guideline for cleaning up a nail polish spill on different surfaces. 1. Assess the situation: - Check the surface on which the nail polish has spilled. Different surfaces will require different cleaning methods. Common surfaces might include fabric, carpet, hardwood floors, and tiles. 2. Gather the necessary tools and materials: Depending on the surface, the following items may be required: - Acetone/nail polish remover (avoid using acetone on wood or fabrics that can be damaged by it) - Cotton balls, paper towels, or clean cloth - Microfiber cloth - Hydrogen peroxide (for carpet and fabric surfaces) - Rubbing alcohol (for wood surfaces) - Baking soda - Plastic putty knife - Warm water - Liquid dish soap - Gloves (to prevent direct contact with chemicals) 3. Cleaning nail polish on different surfaces: **Fabric:** - Start by blotting the excess nail polish using a cloth or a paper towel. Do not rub the spill, as it may spread and push the polish deeper into the fabric. - If the fabric is washable, soak it in cold water. Mix one teaspoon of liquid dish soap with warm water and soak the fabric for 15-20 minutes. - Gently dab the stained area using a cloth dipped in acetone, focusing on the outer edges of the spill. Remember to test the acetone on a hidden area of the fabric to ensure it won't cause discoloration. - Rinse the fabric with cold water and, if the stain is still visible, repeat the acetone treatment. - When the stain is removed, wash the fabric as per the care instructions. **Carpet:** - Blot excess nail polish with a clean cloth or paper towel. Make sure not to rub the spill. - Carefully apply hydrogen peroxide to the affected area using a cotton ball, working from the perimeter of the stain towards the center. - Blot the area again with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb the loosened nail polish. - Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible. - Rinse the area with cold water and blot dry with a clean cloth or paper towel. **Hardwood floors:** - Put on gloves to protect your hands from chemicals. - Use a plastic putty knife to scrape away as much dried nail polish as possible without scratching the floor. - Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a cloth, then gently rub the stain, working from the outside edges and moving inwards. If the stain is not coming off easily, make a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the stain, allowing it to sit for a few minutes. - Wipe away the paste with a damp microfiber cloth and repeat the process as needed until the stain is gone. - Dry the area thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth. **Tiles:** - Promptly wipe away the excess nail polish with a paper towel or cloth to prevent it from seeping into tile grout. - Apply acetone to a cloth and gently rub the stained tile surface. - After the nail polish is removed, clean the area with warm water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. - Rinse with water and wipe dry with a clean cloth. 4. Final step for all surfaces: After the nail polish is removed, ensure that the area is clean and free of any residue. Allow the surface to air-dry completely before using it again. Remember to always store nail polish in a safe and secure location to prevent future spills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D.

The Easter Bunny is a popular choice for cards, although Australians have traded the bunny for a native bilby.","completion":"Title: The Timeless Charm of Easter Symbols: A Journey Through the Ages Introduction Easter, a cherished holiday celebrated across the globe, holds a special place in the hearts of millions. Packed with sentiment and symbolism, this festive season is a living testimony to the rich traditions and customs that have shaped human civilization. One of the key elements of the Easter holiday is the exchange of greeting cards, often adorned with iconic symbols such as daffodils, chicks, rabbits, and more. In this article, we explore the fascinating history of these symbols, their evolution, and their significance in the celebration of this vibrant occasion. A Glimpse into the Past Dating back to the late 19th century, the tradition of sending Easter greeting cards was considered an important aspect of the cultural tapestry. The earliest examples of these cards, preserved carefully as treasures of time, showcase a remarkable preference for symbols that have become synonymous with Easter. Nature's Charms: Daffodils, Chicks, and Rabbits Since the very beginning, nature-based symbols have been a popular choice for Easter cards. Daffodils, with their beautiful, trumpet-shaped flowers in vivid hues of yellow, have always featured prominently. Their arrival coincides with the onset of spring, serving as a tangible reminder of new beginnings and the sweetness of renewed life. Chicks, with their tender, yellow feathers and delicate forms, are emblematic of fertility and new life. As integral icons of the Easter narrative, they complement the festivities beautifully. Rabbits, another prominent symbol, can be traced back to ancient rituals surrounding the worship of deities associated with fertility. With their prolific breeding habits, rabbits have emerged as enduring symbols of life and vitality. Over time, these cuddly creatures have evolved into the popular figure of the Easter Bunny, enthralling children and adults alike with tales of hidden eggs and gifts. Angelic Inspiration: Cherubs and Angels Some of the oldest Easter cards emphasize the spiritual significance of the holiday, focusing on traditional religious scenes. Featuring cherubs and angels, these timeless cards highlight the divine aspect of Easter, serving as an artful reminder of the miracle of resurrection. Rosy-cheeked and ethereal, these celestial beings gracefully deliver the Easter message, embodying the sacred essence of the holiday. The Easter Bunny Versus the Bilby Although the Easter Bunny remains a favorite subject for Easter cards worldwide, a nation-specific variation has emerged in Australia. Recognizing the environmental threat posed by rabbits to native fauna and flora, Australians have embraced the native bilby as their Easter symbol. The Easter Bilby has become an icon in its own right, replacing the rabbit on greeting cards and other cultural paraphernalia. This novel adaptation showcases both regional pride and ecological awareness, enriching the holiday experience in the land down under. Conclusion The enchanting symbols that grace Easter cards serve as a testament to the timelessness of this holiday. Whether we turn our eyes to the delicate daffodils, the endearing chicks, the spirited rabbits, or the divine cherubs and angels, these images encapsulate the essence of Easter. Over the years, these symbols have evolved to reflect various cultural and ecological sensitivities, such as the replacement of the Easter Bunny with the Bilby in Australia. As we come together to celebrate this festive season, let us allow these cherished symbols to remind us of the extraordinary history that lies at the heart of this holiday, as well as the values and virtues they represent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Gently wipe the screen in a circular motion with the cloth until the screen is clean and dry.; B). Fill the spray bottle with distilled water. Spray your microfiber cloth (not the screen). Gently scrub the screen in a circular motion with the cloth until the screen is clean and dry.;","completion":"The correct way to clean a flat screen TV is in option A: Firstly, it’s important to know that you should only use a soft cloth when dealing with a flat screen TV, and the most preferable choice would be a microfiber cloth. This type of cloth is great for cleaning screens because its fibers have the capability to attract dust and absorb oils without scratching or leaving streaks on the delicate screen. The cloth should also be comfortable to hold and able to reach all corners of the screen easily. Secondly, to do the cleaning, you need to fill a spray bottle with distilled water. It's important to note that you should never spray any liquid directly onto your flat screen TV as this can cause damage. The liquid can drip down into the electronics and lead to malfunction. Also, distilled water is preferable to tap water because it doesn’t contain the minerals found in the latter, which could potentially damage the screen or leave residues. After filling the spray bottle with distilled water, then you spray the microfiber cloth, ensuring the cloth is damp but not soaking wet. This damp cloth is less likely to scratch the monitor and it can easily wipe away dust and dirt. Upon spraying the cloth, you will then gently wipe the screen in a circular motion. The circular motion helps to avoid streaks and can get rid of dust and smudges evenly. Sticking to gentle moves is crucial, as hard pressing and scrubbing can scratch or damage the screen. Continuously wipe gently until you see no more streaks, dust, or grime on the screen. Finally, you should ensure the screen is dry before you turn the TV on. If the cloth is not enough to dry the screen, use a dry area of the microfiber cloth to go over it. This method helps to prevent any moisture damage from occurring, which could affect the performance of your TV. Remember, do not use any kind of detergent or cleaning product to clean your flat screen TV unless it is specifically made for this purpose. Regular cleaning products may contain chemicals that are too harsh and could irreparably damage the screen. Also, make sure to unplug the TV while cleaning to prevent any accidents or short-outs due to incidental moisture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The jump was driven largely by a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that put Republican Joni Ernst 7 percentage points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley in a Senate race seen as a must-win for Democrats. In that race, Pivit puts Ernst's chances at 88%. Pivit also offers bad news for Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado, whose chances are at just 6%, and Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, who's down to 2%. Pivit's analysis suggests Democrats are in better shape in North Carolina, where Sen. Kay Hagan has a 69% chance of holding off Republican challenger Thom Tillis, and in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's chances of beating Scott Brown are up to 81%. Republicans, meanwhile, look to have put Kentucky's Senate race out of reach. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell's chances of surviving a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes are up to 97%.

By the end of 1994, they held the WCW Tag Team Championship after defeating Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December. After dropping the title to The Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995. Afterward, Harlem Heat got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat won the WCW World Tag Team titles at Fall Brawl 1995, defeating Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Their third title reign only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from The American Males (Buff Bagwell and Scotty Riggs). On the June 24, 1996 Nitro, Harlem Heat defeated Lex Luger and Sting to capture their fifth WCW World Tag Team titles. Three days after losing the tag team titles to the Steiner Brothers, Harlem Heat regained the titles back from the Steiners on July 27. On September 23, Booker T and Stevie Ray were defeated by Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) but took the titles back for the seventh time on October 1. They lost the Tag Team Championship to the Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) on October 27. Subsequently, they fired Col. Parker and beat him up and became full-fledged faces. They then entered into a brief feud against Col. Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they won. In 1997, they feuded with Public Enemy (Grunge & Rocco), The Steiners, and the nWo. In fall 1997, they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline. They were briefly put out of action by the nWo and returned to feud with the Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Stevie then took five months off from WCW to recover from an ankle injury and Jacqueline left for the WWF.

Atunci când discutăm despre \\"revizuirea Directivei privind călătoriile cu pachet turistic\\", avem în vedere examinarea și posibila modificare a reglementărilor actuale privind călătoriile cu pachet turistic. Această directivă este responsabilă de stabilirea normelor pentru protejarea consumatorilor care achiziționează pachete turistice sau servicii de călătorie legate. Revizuirea are scopul de a clarifica ce se întâmplă în cazul unor \\"situații extraordinare\\" - evenimente neașteptate sau neprevăzute, cum ar fi dezastre naturale sau tulburări politice, care afectează călătoria. Astfel de clarificări ar putea include detalii despre cine este responsabil pentru ce, cum și când sunt aplicate garanțiile și ce compensații în cazul anulării sau întârzierii pot fi așteptate de la consumatori. De exemplu, în cazul anulării unei călătorii din cauza unei situații extraordinare, se va clarifica dacă operatorul de turism este responsabil pentru returnarea banilor sau oferirea unor alternative de călătorie. De asemenea, s-ar putea discuta și modificările la \\"Regulamentul privind drepturile pasagerilor\\", o referire la legile existente care protejează pasagerii în diferite moduri de transport (cum ar fi aeronavele, trenurile, vapoarele și autobuzele). Acestea includ drepturile la compensație și asistență în cazul întârzierilor sau anulării, și la tratament egal pentru toți pasagerii, indiferent de țara de origine sau de destinație. În cazul unei \\"situații extraordinare\\" prelungite, s-ar putea dori un examen al acestor drepturi pentru a se asigura că rămân relevante, corecte și eficiente. Aceste două aspecte - revizuirea Directivei privind călătoriile cu pachet turistic și modificările la Regulamentul privind drepturile pasagerilor - sunt aspecte deosebit de importante pentru protejarea drepturilor consumatorilor și asigurarea unei funcționări echitabile și eficiente a pieței serviciilor de călătorie și de turism. Astfel, speranța exprimată aici este ca Comisia să-și prezinte propunerile de revizuire și modificare cât mai curând posibil, pentru a clarifica aceste chestiuni și a oferi un grad suplimentar de securitate consumatorilor în fața situațiilor extraordinare."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Would \\"There are large time gaps in the internal chronology between the first five episodes, ranging from one to thirty years.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"\\"Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumetachi\\", also known as \\"Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne\\", is a six-episode anime television series produced by Xebec and Genco, featuring grotesque and erotic visuals. The anime originally aired between February and July 2008 on AT-X, and was later licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment. \\"Would 'There are large time gaps in the internal chronology between the first five episodes, ranging from one to thirty years.' be a reasonable answer?\\" Yes, indeed, your statement is quite fitting. The distinctive structure of the series contributes to its uniqueness, with each episode self-contained yet interconnected. The narrative technique used in the series is indeed characterized by substantial time lapses between episodes. For instance, the timeframe between the first and second episode spans an entire decade. Likewise, the story places twenty years between the third and second episodes. Each episode stands on its own individual lapse in time, hence moving the story forward progressively into the future. What's more fascinating is each episode in the first five deals with different aspects of Rin's existence, her clients, her encounters, and her relationships, which unfold over time. The final episode departs from this usual storytelling style and revisits past events by providing additional details and insights into Rin’s fascinating life. In conclusion, yes, stating there are substantial time gaps in the internal chronology between the first five episodes of \\"Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumetachi\\", ranging from one to thirty years, is an accurate and comprehensive summation of the show’s unique structure. This use of abrupt time jumps and the way the narrative plays out over these stretched time periods certainly adds a compelling edge to the overall presentation of the series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
