When it says \\"A blond-haired boy,\\" it is defining the hair color of the boy as blond, emphasizing the distinguishing characteristic of his hair color. The adjective 'blond-haired' is a vital piece of information that enables us to visualize the boy and his appearance. On the other hand, the statement \\"The boy has black hair\\" contradicts the information provided in the original sentence. If the boy indeed had black hair, the initial description should have been \\"A black-haired boy sits on a bus while gazing out the window towards an intersection in a city.\\" It is important to comprehend the information presented in a given sentence or text accurately to avoid misinterpretation or incorrect conclusions. In summary, the correct understanding of the original sentence is that the boy has blond hair, not black hair, as he sits on a bus and gazes out the window towards an intersection in a city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Identify the hypothesis The hypothesis being considered is \\"Clinton is terrified of losing the individual court cases.\\" Step 3: Compare the premise with the hypothesis In the premise, it is stated that Clinton doesn't mind losing individual court cases if it buys him time. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that Clinton is terrified of losing those cases. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis In this case, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis. Since entails means the premise must logically lead to the conclusion or hypothesis being true, we can determine that: Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis \\"Clinton is terrified of losing the individual court cases,\\" as the premise claims that Clinton doesn't mind losing those cases as long as it buys him time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Why do Recruiters not seem to know the difference between a Black Box QA Engineer and a QA White Box Engineer? \\"Aviation Accidents and Incidents: Why is a black box (flight data recorder) called a 'black' box?\\" Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"No, those questions are not the same. They talk about different things. Let me explain: 1. The first question is about jobs: Black Box QA Engineer and White Box QA Engineer. Black Box QA Engineer checks if software works well without knowing how it was made. It's like watching a magic trick and saying if it's good, without knowing how it's done. White Box QA Engineer checks how software is made by looking at the code and finding any wrong parts. It's like checking the recipe of a cake to see if it's made correctly. Recruiters might get confused because both jobs are about making sure software works well, but they do it in different ways. 2. The second question is about airplanes and the black box, which is called a flight data recorder. The black box is an important part in airplanes. It records what the airplane is doing, like how fast it is flying, where it is going, and what the pilots are saying. If an airplane has an accident, the black box helps people understand what happened. The name \\"black box\\" is a bit confusing because it's usually orange or red, not black. So, the first question is about jobs related to software testing, and the second question is about a part in airplanes that helps understand accidents. They are different questions about different things."},{"prompt":"Information: - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\". - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Frankenstein's monster, sometimes known as Frankenstein, is a fictional character whose fictional creator was Victor Frankenstein. The monster first appeared, without any name, in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". Shelley's title thus compares Victor Frankenstein to the mythological character Prometheus who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature took on the name \\"Frankenstein\\" in later years. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities. - Count Dracula is the title character and main antagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad III the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Other character aspects have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works. The character has subsequently appeared frequently in popular culture, from films to animated media to breakfast cereals. - Sagas are stories mostly about ancient Nordic and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, the battles that took place during the voyages, about migration to Iceland and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A werewolf (from , \\"man\\"), man-wolf, or lycanthrope (\\"lykánthropos\\": , \\"lykos\\", \\"wolf\\", and , \\"anthrpos\\", \\"human\\") is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in lycanthropy are Petronius (2766) and Gervase of Tilbury (11501228). - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Werewolf fiction denotes the portrayal of werewolves and other shapeshifting man/woman-beasts, in the media of literature, drama, film, games, and music. Werewolf literature includes folklore, legend, saga, fairy tales, Gothic and Horror fiction, fantasy fiction and poetry. Such stories may be supernatural, symbolic or allegorical. A classic American cinematic example of the theme is \\"The Wolf Man\\" (1941) and in later films joins with Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, as one of the three famous icons of the modern day horror. However, werewolf fiction is an exceptionally diverse genre with ancient folkloric roots and manifold modern re-interpretations. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - This is a list of wolves in fiction , including normal wolves and anthropomorphic wolf characters . For werewolf characters see werewolf fiction . - Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, famous for introducing the character of the vampire Count Dracula. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.

We have this math problem: 514790 * a - 514969 * a + 3759 = 0 Now imagine you have 514,790 apples (a lot of apples, I know!) and you multiply them by a number \\"a\\". Then, you have 514,969 oranges and you also multiply them by the same number \\"a\\". Now subtract the oranges from the apples. You'll have fewer oranges than apples, so you'll still have some apples leftover. Finally, you add 3,759 apples. And it says this is equal to 0. Now let's find what the number \\"a\\" is! First, let's simplify the problem. Since both apples and oranges have an 'a', we can combine their numbers: 514790 * a - 514969 * a = -179 * a (we got -179 by subtracting the second number from the first number) Now, the problem looks like this: -179 * a + 3759 = 0 To solve for 'a', we'll move the 3759 to the other side of the equation: -179 * a = -3759 Now, we'll divide both sides by -179 to find 'a': a = -3759 / -179 When you do the division, you'll find that: a = 21 So, the number \\"a\\" is 21!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

În ultimii ani, organizațiile europene s-au confruntat cu numeroase provocări, de la creșterea populismului și a mișcărilor anti-UE, până la criza migranților și problemele economice. Pentru a face față acestor probleme într-un mod eficient și durabil, este esențial ca instituțiile europene să acționeze astfel încât să poată satisface nevoile cetățenilor și să poată face față provocărilor actuale și viitoare. Pentru a aborda problema în mod serios, instituțiile europene ar putea lua în considerare următoarele măsuri: 1. Consolidați cooperarea și coordonarea între statele membre: Acest lucru ar implica o colaborare și comunicare mai strânsă între țările membre ale UE pentru a stabili obiective comune și strategii eficiente în diverse domenii precum politica externă, defense, economie și protecția mediului. 2. Consolidarea democrației și a transparenței în cadrul UE: Acesta este un element cheie pentru a câștiga încrederea cetățenilor și a combate efectele populismului și euroscepticismului. Instituțiile europene ar trebui să lucreze la promovarea valorilor democratice, a statului de drept și a drepturilor fundamentale, garantând în același timp transparența și răspunderea lor. 3. Investiți în dezvoltarea economică și socială a Europei: Aceasta include investiții în educație, cercetare și infrastructură, creând locuri de muncă și stimulând creșterea economică. De asemenea, este important să își dubleze eforturile pentru a combate sărăcia și inegalitatea, promovând în același timp solidaritatea între statele membre și regiuni. 4. Abordați schimbările climatice și protejați mediul: Instituțiile europene ar trebui să continue să-și intensifice eforturile pentru a combate schimbările climatice și a promova dezvoltarea durabilă, prin reducerea emisiilor de gaze cu efect de seră, promovarea energiilor regenerabile și protejarea biodiversității. 5. Elaborarea unei politici de migrație echilibrate și durabile: Acest aspect implică gestionarea corectă și eficientă a fluxurilor de migrație, precum și integrarea armonioasă a migranților și refugiaților în societățile europene. De asemenea, este crucială abordarea cauzelor fundamentale ale migrației și a cooperării cu țările de origine și de tranzit.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? of a first-rate cast","completion":"The phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" is generally considered positive. In order to provide a detailed and extended explanation, let's break down the phrase and analyze each component. 1. \\"First-rate\\": The term \\"first-rate\\" is an adjective, which means it is a word used to describe a noun. In this context, \\"first-rate\\" is being used to describe the quality or competence of the cast. The word \\"first-rate\\" itself denotes top or superior quality, indicating that the cast being referred to is among the best or is highly talented. Using such a term to describe a cast indicates that they possess exceptional skills and abilities in their craft. 2. \\"Cast\\": The \\"cast\\" refers to a group of actors or performers who come together to put on a theatrical, film, or television production. A cast is an essential part of any production as it often consists of an ensemble of talented individuals with diverse skills and background, who work collectively to bring characters and stories to life. With these two components combined, the phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" suggests that the referred cast comprises highly skilled and accomplished actors or performers. By extension, this implies that their acting abilities, chemistry, and combined effort make the overall production or show stand out and excel. Such a cast would garner admiration from both critics and audiences and appear in high-quality, well-received projects. In conclusion, the phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" is considered a positive description, as it speaks to the exceptional level of talent, competence, and skill possessed by the actors or performers that form the cast in question. This phrase's use would typically suggest the utmost satisfaction and praise for the cast's abilities and the quality of the production or show."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection.

Even many adults who do not fit the clinic definition of obesity are still overweight,and a large percentage are looking for the best ways to lose weight. Reducing pounds largely comes down to the two-sided factors of diet and exercise.Not carrying out the first one enough,and not getting enough of the second one,ends up giving the individual a recipe for being overweight. Advising someone to eat less and exercise more might be the easiest advice possible,but it's also,partially,an oversimplification.Dieting has more to do with the types of food you eat than how much you eat.Reduce the amount of red meat in your diet.If you don't want to eliminate red meat altogether,choose cuts of meat with less fat content.Limit your intake of salt and starches.If you've got to have potato chips alongside your sandwich at lunch,choose the baked potato chips that contain less fat than the deep-fried chips.You might find you're really not sacrificing that much in terms of taste. A diet rich in fruits,vegetables,egg whites,fish and nonfat dairy products will certainly aid in the mission of losing weight.Drink more water and less sugary drinks.If you have to have a soda,a diet soda is a better option,but seltzer is an even better choice than that.

We gave Tiger swimming lessons in our plastic wading pool. I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.

Question: This article: Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina).

Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. In the Chinese culture, the tighter represents strength and power. In her book, Ms. Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. Chua writes that her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to go on a date, be in a school play, watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A. They had to play piano or violin - and no other musical instruments. She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B - which she says \\"would never happen\\" - there would be \\"a screaming, hair-tearing explosion.\\" She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly - yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom - until it was. Many people have criticized Amy Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, objected to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Stacy Debroff, who has written four books on parenting, says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacy Debroff advises parents not to just repeat the way they were raised.

They function as centrioles, which play a crucial role in the formation of the spindle apparatus during cell division (mitosis and meiosis), ensuring the correct distribution of genetic material into the daughter cells. Additionally, basal bodies also serve as the foundation for the formation of cilia and flagella, which are hair-like structures that aid in cell movement. So, besides cell division, basal bodies can also be indirectly related to movement (through the formation of cilia and flagella)."},{"prompt":"Q:The answer to the question: What was the name of the person that Pink Floyd hoped that their erratic behavior would be a passing phase? is inside the article: Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \\"See Emily Play\\" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing..., can you guess it ?

South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun Thursday asked the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) to investigate questions arising about the Foreign Ministry's response to the kidnapping of a South Korean in Iraq who was later killed by Muslim militants, according to Yonhap. Can we draw the following conclusion? They always kill South Korean's that are kidnapped","completion":"Based on the information provided about the kidnapping of a South Korean in Iraq who was later killed by Muslim militants, it would be inaccurate to draw a sweeping conclusion that \\"they always kill South Koreans that are kidnapped.\\" This statement is an overgeneralization that does not consider the complexities and nuances of such situations. We must analyze the broader context and assess individual cases independently to form valid conclusions. Firstly, it is essential to understand that the kidnapping and murder of the South Korean in this case took place in a specific context. In this instance, it was during an insurgency in Iraq when different militant groups were carrying out abductions of foreigners to advance their political goals. While this case is tragic and deserves attention, it is not representative of every situation in which a South Korean might be kidnapped. Secondly, the term \\"they\\" in the statement could refer to various groups of people, making the assertion even more flawed. The statement assumes all kidnappings are carried out by a single, homogeneous group of perpetrators who consistently follow the same tactics in dealing with kidnapped individuals, which is clearly not the case. Kidnappers may range from terrorists to criminal gangs or even individuals acting alone, each with their own motives and methods. Moreover, it is important to note that each kidnapping case is unique and can be influenced by an array of factors such as the goals of the kidnappers, the characteristics of the victim, the political climate, and international pressure, among others. The outcomes of kidnappings cannot be generalized in such a simplistic manner, as each situation develops differently. In some instances, kidnapped victims may be released unharmed, while others might be held for ransom or, tragically, be killed. Finally, drawing a conclusion based on one specific incident would not be statistically valid or representative of the entire scope of kidnappings involving South Koreans. Cases of abductions and kidnappings globally vary widely, and it is necessary to examine multiple sources, statistics, and historical trends to identify patterns and make informed conclusions. In conclusion, the statement that \\"they always kill South Koreans that are kidnapped\\" is an overgeneralization that does not consider the numerous factors that affect individual kidnapping cases. A more accurate understanding can only be achieved by examining each situation in its unique context and considering various influencing factors such as the motives of the kidnappers, the political landscape, and the specific circumstances surrounding the abduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that played drums for Warsaw on their first gig? , can you please find it? On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

Dretke to the other case that was held in the Supreme Court?\\" Context: \\"The United States Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bigby v. Dretke have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health violate the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The general policy that connects Bigby v. Dretke to the other case held in the Supreme Court, Penry v. Lynaugh, is the requirement for jury instructions in death penalty cases to explicitly include consideration for mitigating factors relating to the defendant's mental health. This policy is based on the protection of the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. In both cases, the courts emphasized the importance of providing clear and specific instructions to the jury regarding the consideration of mitigating factors when they are answering unrelated questions. This policy stems from the understanding that jurors need to be well-informed about the defendant's mental health and how that could potentially affect their culpability. Without such instructions, there is a risk of jurors not factoring in these mitigating circumstances, leading to a potentially unjust sentence. The United States Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh (1989) ruled that the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, violated the Eighth Amendment. The Court highlighted the need for the jury to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. The case established the guideline that courts should ensure jury instructions allow for proper consideration of mitigating factors, which could warrant a sentence less severe than the death penalty. Similarly, in Bigby v. Dretke (2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the importance of including mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health in jury instructions of death penalty cases. In this case, the Court found that the jury instructions did not adequately address the defendant's mental health as a mitigating factor, and consequently, the court held that the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights were violated. The policy connecting these two cases emphasizes the necessity of specific explanations to jurors about the relevance of mitigating factors and the importance of considering them in the sentencing process. Despite the two cases involving different sets of facts, both courts agreed that jury instructions in death penalty cases must present clear, comprehensive, and explicit information about the defendant's mental health issues and other potential mitigating factors. By doing so, the courts aim to ensure that defendants' Eighth Amendment rights are protected and that jurors are equipped with the necessary guidance to make informed and just decisions in capital cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 182-meters (597 feet) bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence... (Associated Press) KEVADIYA, India (AP) — India's prime minister on Wednesday unveiled a towering bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence leader and the country's first home minister after British colonialists left in 1947. At 182 meters (597 feet), it is one of the tallest statues in the world built at a cost of 403 million in Kevadiya, a village in Gujarat state. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Patel hail from Gujarat state. Modi inaugurated the \\"Statue of Unity\\" on the bank of the Narmada river. He had promised the project despite criticism that India couldn't afford to spend so much money on a statue. Indian air force planes showered flower petals on the statue. Patel was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" for integrating various states in the post-independence era as the creation of Pakistan led to a massive bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims moving between the two nations. On Wednesday, Modi said Patel was a beacon of hope for India in the time of crisis and he will be a source of inspiration for ages to come. Rashesh Patel, a 42-year-old businessman, said \\"though Patel was from Gujarat state, all Indians were proud of him because of his stature.\\" Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel were the three key leaders of India's independence struggle, he said. The monument will have a museum with 40,000 documents, 2,000 photographs and a research center dedicated to Patel's life and work. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The \\"statue of unity\\" has been billed as a tourist attraction. India has unveiled the world's tallest statue, which cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; 430m) to build. The 182m (600ft) high structure in the western state of Gujarat is a bronze-clad tribute to independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the \\"statue of unity\\" would serve as a major tourist attraction. But locals say this is as a waste of public money and that the funds could have been put to better use. Mr Modi, who unveiled the statue at a grand inaugural event, said it is \\"a symbol of India's integrity and resolve.\\" Air Force planes showered flowers on the statue, which was designed by decorated Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar. According to local reports, thousands of policemen have been deployed across the district, where protests over the effigy have turned violent. Police detained farmers and tribal activists during a protest on Tuesday. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stunning visuals of the world's tallest statue The statue has become a rallying point for local farmers who are demanding compensation for land that they say has been acquired by the government for various projects, including the construction of the memorial. The Gujarat government is reported to have paid more than half of the funds for the statue, while the remainder came from the federal government or public donations. The memorial has been seen as a pet project of Mr Modi, who like Patel, was born in Gujarat. He commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010. It is nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty. And it has surpassed the height of the Spring Temple Buddha in China which, at 128m, was previously the tallest in the world. But it won't remain the world's tallest statue for long. The government in the western state of Maharashtra is constructing a memorial to the Maratha warrior king Shivaji that is estimated to be 190m tall. Patel was India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" after he persuaded feuding states to unite and become part of the Indian state after independence. While campaigning in 2013 to become prime minister, Mr Modi said, \\"every Indian regrets that Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister\\". In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy. While Congress party politicians say Patel was a member of their party, the BJP says the freedom fighter's legacy belongs to everybody. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials expect that the 182m tall statue will attract millions of annual visitors Officials expect that the site, located some 200km (125 miles) from Gujarat's main city, Ahmedabad, will attract about 2.5 million annual visitors and will help boost local economy. Visitors can go up to the viewing gallery, which is located near the chest of the statue at a height of 153m. But locals, including farmers, are sceptical. \\"Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,\\" Vijendra Tadvi, a farmer who also worked as a driver on the statue's construction site, told BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar. What went into making the world's tallest statue? |||||","completion":"In India, there is a huge statue called the \\"Statue of Unity.\\" It is in a village called Kevadiya in Gujarat state. The statue is very special because it is one of the tallest statues in the world. It is 182 meters (597 feet) tall and made of bronze. The statue is of a man named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was an important leader when India became free from British rule in 1947. Many people think he did a great job of uniting India. The statue was built to show hope and also to be a popular place for tourists to visit. However, some people are not happy about it. They think that the money spent to build the statue could have been used in a better way, like helping farmers. But for now, the Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, and it shows how much people respect Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his work in India."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Here are three girls.

When investing time and emotional energy into a film, one expects the story to reward their commitment with a satisfying, if not always happy, resolution. \\"Disaster Strikes,\\" however, falls short in delivering an engaging or meaningful narrative, leaving the viewer feeling stranded in a sea of poorly-executed plotlines. This review aims to evaluate the numerous shortcomings of the movie that contribute to its underwhelming impact. From the outset, the film's pacing was a major detriment to the overall experience. Rather than easing into the story, the audience was bombarded with rapid-fire exposition, leaving little room for proper introduction to characters and their motivations. The inability to seamlessly establish the narrative context meant that viewers were left to fill in the gaps of poorly-structured storytelling. In addition to the confusing nature of the plot, the main characters lacked depth and relatability. Instead of being engagements with unique viewpoints, many of the characters felt one-dimensional, serving merely as plot devices to drive the story forward. The lack of a fully-realized protagonist prevented the audience from immersing themselves in the emotional journey and ultimately dulled the impact of the film's climax. Moreover, \\"Disaster Strikes\\" failed to deliver in terms of visual effects and cinematography. Though budget restraints may have played a part, it is difficult to overlook the bland use of color and uninspired shot compositions. The film's creators could have utilized innovative techniques to create a more visually captivating experience, but the end result was a lackluster presentation. The previously mentioned issues culminate in the film's disappointing resolution, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. The storyline's loose ends were abundant and unsatisfying, making it nearly impossible to derive any sort of fulfillment or understanding from the conclusion. Upon assessing these aspects of \\"Disaster Strikes,\\" it is difficult to find any redeeming factors that could potentially salvage the experience.

Please note that neither sentence influences the other as they are independent statements in a multi-choice question. Sentence 1: How do you know if you really love her? Jon looked at the man a long time. This sentence is essentially a question being asked either by the reader, another character, or possibly even Jon himself. It is not a true or false statement that can affect the second sentence. The only information provided is that Jon looked at the man for a long time, which does not provide any clarification or context for the question on if Jon really loves \\"her.\\" Sentence 2: He secretly loved Jon.

Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" What is the possible benefit of reading classic works according to the study?

This is useful because only simple molecules can be absorbed by the intestine. - Therefore, if more fluid and enzymes from the liver are pumped into the small intestine, it implies a greater breakdown capacity for food molecules. - Therefore, this would enhance the breakdown and digestion of more food. - The result would not be less food digested (option B) because an increase in enzymes would facilitate more digestion rather than less. - The process wouldn't stay unchanged (option C) since the higher enzyme concentration would accelerate the food breakdown process. - Hence, the answer is more (Option A), suggesting that the presence of more liver fluids would lead to more food being digested."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid mood-altering substances. Exercise moderately to calm your nerves. Look your best. Eat healthy","completion":"Title: Mastering Public Speaking Anxiety Through Holistic Wellness Practices Public speaking has long been a fear that many people face. The raised heart rate, trembling uncertainty, and apprehensive tension before delivering a speech are familiar feelings to many. However, utilizing a routine of holistic wellness practices can substantially alleviate these symptoms and ensure a successful speech performance. Following a comprehensive strategy that includes ample rest, stress minimization, abstaining from mood-altering substances, moderate exercise, practicing good personal grooming, and maintaining a healthy diet can hold the key to overcoming the fear of public speaking. One of the most fundamental and often overlooked aspects of preparing for a speech is getting enough rest. While there may be an underlying temptation to spend the night before a presentation preparing or revising your speech, remember that your brain needs sufficient rest to function optimally and handle stress. Ample sleep contributes to better memory retention and concentration, crucial pins that hold your speech presentation together. The American Sleep Association states that adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, so make sure you are clocking in those hours, especially before your speaking engagement. Minimizing stress in the hours or days leading up to the event is another pivotal step towards seamless public speaking. Stress response is our body’s way to deal with perceived threats, and it can certainly view the prospect of standing in front of an audience as a threat. The impact of stress can affect cognitive functions such as focus, memory, and judgment, hindering your performance. To manage external stress factors, make a conscious effort to avoid other stressful events or situations before your speech, meditate to balance your thoughts, or practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, that can calm your body's stress response. The use of mood-altering substances such as caffeine and alcohol can seem enticing to many looking for a quick fix for their public speaking anxiety. While these substances might offer temporary reprieve, they can lead to heightened anxiety, memory impairment, and decreased motor control, interfering with your ability to deliver a smooth speech. Instead, consider sipping on calming chamomile tea or a glass of water to stay hydrated and focused. Exercise plays a significant role in not only maintaining a healthy lifestyle but also in managing anxiety and boosting self-confidence. When you engage in moderate physical activity, your body releases endorphins, known as “feel-good hormones,” which can dramatically reduce anxiety and improve mood. A brisk walk, jog, or yoga session before your presentation can help dispel nervous energy and foster a state of calm focus that will aid in your performance. Similarly, how you present yourself can significantly influence your public speaking experience. Looking your best isn’t just about vanity; it’s about feeling confident and comfortable. Dressing appropriately, maintaining basic grooming habits, and wearing clothes that help you feel comfortable, yet professional, can bolster your self-confidence and enable you to command a robust presence when you step onto the stage. Lastly, maintaining a balanced and healthy diet cannot be overstressed. Consuming nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health and cognition. Especially on the day of your speech, avoid heavy meals that can cause lethargy or discomfort. Instead, opt for light meals packed with complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and fresh fruits and vegetables, which provide sustained energy and help keep your brain alert. In conclusion, managing public speaking anxiety is more about a holistic lifestyle approach than just the moment on stage. Incorporating the practices of getting enough rest, minimizing stress, avoiding mood-altering substances, engaging in moderate exercise, maintaining good grooming, and eating a healthy diet can greatly enhance your public speaking ability and ease any lingering nervousness, paving the way for greater confidence and success in your presentation endeavors."},{"prompt":"Question: Who needs to appear at the fake funerals?

Laxmikant Kabadiya aka LK (Anupam Kher), is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - comprising of his spinster twin sister Prerna, his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer, their wives Shruti and Anju respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK, is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. Which results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK's... And stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Complicating matters further are an inquisitive and greedy servant, the Prime Minister's fixer, a procurer of dead bodies, the paparazzi and for good measure a couple of cops.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Mexican authorities said late Friday that they had captured a woman wanted in connection with the killing of a pediatric dentist in her Uptown parking garage. The Mexican attorney general’s office said Brenda Delgado, 33, was captured at a house in Torreón, in Coahuila state. She will be held at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in Mexico City while she awaits extradition proceedings. The FBI confirmed in a statement that Delgado was taken into custody without incident. Delgado — who was added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted fugitives list earlier in the week — faces charges of capital murder and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in connection with the death of Kendra Hatcher. Hatcher, 35, was fatally shot in the parking garage of an Uptown apartment complex Sept. 2. Police have arrested the suspected gunman and getaway driver. Delgado, who officials say was jealous of Hatcher, is accused of arranging the hit. Hatcher’s brother, Neil Hatcher, told KTVT-TV (Channel 11) that he was “tickled pink” when he heard about the arrest. U.S. and Texas officials had said Wednesday that Delgado, a Mexican citizen, would not face the death penalty if she were detained in Mexico because that nation is opposed to capital punishment. However, Delgado will face life in prison if convicted, Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk said during a news conference at Dallas FBI headquarters. “Justice will be served,” she said. Delgado’s capital murder indictment says that she “and a drug cartel” gave Kristopher Ledell Love drugs and money in exchange for killing Hatcher. Investigators have said that Delgado, who was training to be a dental hygienist, was jealous of Hatcher. Hatcher was dating Delgado’s ex-boyfriend and had recently traveled to San Francisco to meet his parents. Police say Love and getaway driver Crystal Cortes followed Hatcher into the parking garage of the Gables Park apartments near Victory Park, where Love ambushed and fatally shot Hatcher. Delgado, who lived in Pleasant Grove, talked to police once before leaving the country and said she had lent Cortes a Jeep Cherokee that belonged to a friend. Police have said that they initially didn’t think they had enough evidence to arrest Delgado but also didn’t see a reason to place her under 24-hour surveillance — the cost of which would have been prohibitive. “Even if we had put surveillance on her and she decided to go to Mexico, we wouldn’t have had probable cause to stop her,” Maj. Max Geron of the crimes against persons division said in October. “We got the [arrest] warrant as soon as we had probable cause.” Cortes, 24, has said that she didn’t know Hatcher would be killed. She told police that Delgado agreed to pay her 500 to drive Love to rob Hatcher. She told detectives that Delgado used an iPhone to track Hatcher’s cellphone location before the slaying. Cortes faces a capital murder charge and is being held at the Dallas County Jail in lieu of 500,000 bail. Love, 32, was arrested Oct. 2 after police said they found the murder weapon, a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol, under the front seat of his car. Love faces a capital murder charge and a federal weapons charge and is being held in lieu of 2.5 million bail. He has previously been convicted of aggravated assault, aggravated robbery and burglary of a residence in Tennessee. Delgado was the ninth woman to be placed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List since its creation in 1950. A reward of 100,000 was being offered for information that led to her arrest. “Delgado’s addition to the list underscores the violent and calculated nature of the crime she’s accused of committing,” said Thomas M. Class Sr., FBI special agent in charge. Staff writer Kevin Krause contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Brenda Delgado allegedly hired two men to kill her ex-boyfriend's new lover Delgado was the ninth woman placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List (CNN) After months on the run, a woman who allegedly plotted the death of a romantic rival in Texas has been captured in Mexico. Brenda Delgado orchestrated the murder-for-hire of a Dallas dentist who was dating her former boyfriend, authorities said. After her accomplices killed the other woman on September 2, Delgado fled to Mexico, according to authorities. Mexican authorities arrested her Friday, two days after the FBI added her to its list of 10 Most Wanted Fugitives. She was taken into custody without incident in the city of Torreón. Ninth woman Read More ||||| Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter MEXICO CITY (CBSDFW.COM) – The alleged mastermind behind Uptown dentist Kendra Hatcher’s murder — Brenda Delgado — was captured in Mexico. Mexican authorities searched areas where Delgado has friends and family in the states of San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León and Mexico City. The Attorney General’s Office said Friday she was detained in a house in the city of Torreón, in northern Coahuila state. Delgado was then taken to the Santa Marta Acatitla prison in Mexico City pending extradition proceedings. Part of that extradition agreement between the United States and Mexico will take the death penalty off the table for Delgado. Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk has said Delgado will however, face life in prison. Kendra Hatcher’s brother, Neil Hatcher said he was notified of Delgado’s arrest and was “tickled pink” by the news. Hatcher’s sister, Ashley Lipscomb, released the following statement to CBS 11’s Ken Molestina on Saturday evening: “Thank you to Mexico for helping a girl who simply loved your country and community. We extend our sincerest gratitude to those who assisted in the arrest. She majored in Spanish and served in Spain, Ecuador, Texas, and the Cuban community in Florida. Relaxing and rejuvenating in your country was her favorite pastime because she truly felt at home there. Kendra was a dual-citizen at heart and chose to use her God-given abilities and resources to do nothing but love and inspire people across the globe, with emphasis on the Spanish communities.” Thank you again for helping when she needed you. What an amazing way to honor her legacy of service and love. We are grateful.” The FBI added Brenda Delgado to its “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” this week on April 6, 2016. The 33-year-old is the person investigators believe orchestrated the 2015 murder-for-hire of Hatcher. “The FBI is extremely appreciative of our law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as our local, state, and federal partners, for their tremendous cooperation and collaboration in the capture of Top Ten Fugitive Brenda Delgado,” said Thomas M. Class, Sr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office. Hatcher was shot and killed after getting out of her vehicle in the parking garage at the Gables Park 17 high-rise apartment building. FBI officials say it was Dallas Police Department investigators who soon suspected Delgado of hiring two co-conspirators to carry out her plan. The man accused of actually gunning down Hatcher, Kristopher Love, is in custody and faces federal charges. The woman accused of driving Love to the parking garage to murder Hatcher, Crystal Cortes, is also in custody. Thomas M. Class, Sr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office said, “Brenda Delgado was able to effectively manipulate everyone she involved in her calculated scheme. Although she didn’t pull the trigger herself, she is still responsible for the murder.” Officials say Delgado plotted the murder because she was jealous Hatcher, 35, was dating her ex-boyfriend and had recently been introduced to his parents. The now Most Wanted fugitive initially spoke with investigators about the murder, but officials say she fled the country when it became clear she was a person of interest in the murder case. A grand jury indicted Delgado for Capital Murder back in October. A federal arrest warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was issued soon after. The indictment said Delgado promised to give Kristopher Love drugs and money, from herself and a drug cartel, to kill the dentist. Delgado lived in North Texas but is a Mexican citizen. She was born Brenda Berenice Delgado Reynaga, on June 18, 1982. She is the 506th person and the ninth woman to be placed on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” list.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Turkish is a significant language because it is spoken by more than 70 million people worldwide, primarily in Turkey, but also in 35 other countries and territories worldwide. Belonging to the Turkic language family, it is one of the oldest functioning languages in Europe. Turkish language has a rich history that can be traced back to the Altaic languages, but it has also been greatly influenced by Persian, French, Italian, Arabic and English languages. The modern Turkish alphabet is Latin-based and was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk after the fall of the Ottoman Empire during the creation of the Turkish Republic. The sentence you provided in Turkish reads as \\"Until today, the army was trusting the young people recruited and the professional officers.\\" The Turkish language, like other Turkic languages, is agglutinative, meaning that its grammar structure allows for a sequence of several morphemes or syllables in a word, each contributing to the meaning of a word. Turkish also uses vowel harmony, a rule that makes the language sound rhythmical by matching the vowels of the suffixes to the vowels of the stem words. In addition, Turkish is notable for being a subject-object-verb language, whereas English is subject-verb-object. This order can sometimes cause confusion for non-native speakers.

Please write a short summary for the following article: LYNDE BIO SQUARELY DENIES HE OD'D BY GEORGE RUSH AND JOANNA RUSH MOLLOY With Jo Piazza, Chris Rovzar and Maureen Seaberg Thursday, September 1th 2005, 6:52AM The rumors that swirled around the abrupt death of \\"Hollywood Squares\\" icon Paul Lynde in 1982 have been put to rest by a new book, which reveals that the caustic comic was not found dead in the nude and did not overdose on drugs. \\"He wasn't unclothed,\\" eyewitness Paul Barresi explains in the book \\"Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story\\" by Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski. \\"He had on his PJs, and he had his robe on.\\" Barresi, a private eye and close friend of Lynde's, discovered the comic's body in his home after the comedian had not been seen for two days. Lynde, who may be best remembered by children as the voice of Templeton the Rat in \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" had a secret life that involved recreational drugs and male prostitutes, the book alleges. But these vices were not connected to his death, which came from a heart attack at age 55. His autopsy found only a small amount of a sexual stimulant in his bloodstream, and there was no evidence of sexual activity. Lynde inspired love and loathing in Hollywood, according to the book.

He didn't return The News' calls, nor did Bush, who has reportedly repped Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill and billionaire hedge-fund manager Eddie Lampert. Johnson did tell the MTA yesterday that he is no longer interested in buying the West Side rail yard. No matter what his future with the Jets, he'll never make as big a profit as he might have in Manhattan, one knowledgeable sports source claims. And at 58, with a passion for curing the juvenile diabetes that's afflicted his daughter Casey (he's given 12 million to research), Johnson may just may want to touch down somewhere else.

And it sparked criticisms that the Government was breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation's duty of care to troops. But today, after significant media. coverage and a petition signed nearly 100,000 supporters, the Ministry. of Defence said Sgt Anderson had been given the chance to take on a new. role in the Army. An MoD spokesman said: 'There have. been a number of inaccuracies reported surrounding an individual soldier. in an online petition. 'We can be clear that the individual. in question has successfully applied for a transfer to another branch. within the Army, and subject to successful completion of training will. not be made redundant. 'The individual is fully aware of this. and has been kept informed throughout the process. We will continue to. work with him to secure his transfer within the Army.' In a statement, Sgt Anderson added:. 'There has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding an. online petition with the aim of securing my pension. 'I was selected for redundancy but. have applied for transfer to another service within the Army. I have. been successful in the application process and am looking forward to. beginning training for my new role.' Poppy: Mrs Anderson has written an open letter to the Prime Minister asking for better treatment for her soldier husband. It comes after Mrs Anderson started an. online petition on change.org asking the Prime Minister to give her. husband his job back that by tonight had been signed by nearly 100,000. people. Mrs Anderson, whose husband has served. in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, wrote on the site: 'When Michael. was informed of his redundancy I felt like my heart had been ripped out,. more for Michael than me. 'Everything he knew and had worked for. from the age of 16 taken away. We had planned on using the pension to. secure a mortgage when we left army accommodation and to support our. young family while Michael established a new career on civvy street. 'After a life of service for our country our family's financial security has now been cruelly snatched away from us.' She said calling it a 'pension' was. incorrect, arguing that the military pension was 'the key financial. promise on which personnel are recruited, retained and promoted'. Sgt Anderson, a father of two, whose. case was first reported by the Mail in July, has been a soldier since he. was 18 years old. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a. casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or. injured troops. He was told in June that he had been. selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer. with a 12-month notice period, ending on June 18 2014. Had he been allowed to work until June. 21, he would have qualified for an immediate pension and tax-free lump. sum worth an estimated £261,278 over his lifetime. Instead he faced a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reached 60. In the preamble to the petition. started by Mrs Anderson, a mental health care manager, she wrote how she. and her husband had felt 'honoured to be part of the Army family' and. said they wanted to continue to be part of it. And now they have the chance after her. husband was offered a transfer to another branch of the Army - an. opportunity that means he will be able to collect his full pension. If Sgt Anderson successful completes the training for the new job, he will now longer face redundancy. And even if he fails the training. programme he will be eligible for his immediate pension due to the time. spent on his ongoing transfer process. The MoD's spokesman added: 'All those made redundant will receive an Armed Forces pension and a generous compensation package. 'Inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere, but those who are close to their immediate pension point ...will receive a larger tax-free lump sum in compensation.' Army pensions are one of the key selling points to would-be recruits, and guarantees retired soldiers a full monthly pension based on their final salary. One of its chief attractions is the fact that contributors to the scheme do not have their salary deducted each month, as in many other pension schemes. After two years of regular service, soldiers are entitled to receive the pension when they are 65. Soldiers who serve for 12 years will receive a tax-free resettlement grant to ease them into their civilian life. And anyone who is over 40 and has served at least 18 years can claim an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army, with a second lump sum when they turn 65. From April 2015 changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme will come in, meaning soldiers will have to work for 20 years rather than 18 before they can qualify for a full pension. The new scheme will also see retired soldiers able to claim at a reduced rate, rather than the full rate, from the age of 55 until they reach the planned state pension age of 67. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A soldier named Sergeant Michael Anderson was almost going to lose a big part of his pension because he was told he would lose his job just a few days before he could get his full pension. He had been a soldier for almost 18 years and needed to work just 72 more hours to qualify for the pension. Sergeant Anderson and his wife were worried about this because they were counting on the pension, which is like a big savings account, to help them buy a house and take care of their family. Many people thought it was unfair and thought that the Army should treat him better. Luckily, after many people heard about his story and signed a paper saying they wanted him to get his full pension, the Army decided to let him switch to another job within the Army. This means that he will now be able to receive his full pension."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the question and hint, the child who isn't nearsighted is Clarence. He is able to clearly see what is being written on the chalkboard from the back of the classroom, indicating that his distant vision is fine. Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition where distant objects appear blurry. Therefore, because Clarence does not exhibit this symptom and can see distant objects clearly, we can conclude that he is not nearsighted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bulletface Context: Dara Maren is a DEA agent who gets dragged into the seedy underworld of California/Mexico border smuggling in an attempt to protect her younger brother. During a drug deal gone bad, she ends up shooting and killing an undercover ATF agent and is arrested. She's convicted and incarcerated inside a penal colony just outside Tijuana, where the prison officials harvest organs from the inmates. During her incarceration, Dara's brother is murdered by a drug lord who's also using human spinal fluid drained from his victims to create a new DNA-altering drug that turns those who become addicted to it into something not human. As hundreds of dead bodies start turning up along the Mexico border, and with law enforcement and government officials falling victim to its addictive properties as well, an old friend from the FBI manages to bribe the officials in Tijuana to let Dara back out onto the streets in order to bring down the drug lord and avenge her brother's murder. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Bulletface,\\" prison officials are illegally harvesting organs and human spinal fluid from inmates. Set against the backdrop of a seedy California/Mexico border smuggling underworld, Dara Maren, a DEA agent, struggles to protect her younger brother when she is arrested and incarcerated in a penal colony near Tijuana. The prison officials in this colony are involved in the illicit and inhumane practice of extracting organs from inmates to be sold on the black market. Additionally, a drug lord connected to the prison uses the spinal fluid drained from his victims to develop a new DNA-altering drug. This powerful substance is highly addictive and has the alarming ability to transform those who become dependent on it into something less than human. As the drug's influence spreads and the number of dead bodies continues to rise along the border between Mexico and the United States, the situation becomes critical. Law enforcement and government officials also fall prey to the devastating consequences of the drug addiction. In a desperate attempt to bring down the drug lord and avenge her brother's murder, Dara's old friend from the FBI manages to bribe the corrupt Tijuana prison officials to release Dara. As she becomes re-immersed in the dangerous world of drug smuggling, Dara must navigate treacherous territory to put an end to the organ harvesting and spinal fluid extraction from inmates, as well as stop the production and distribution of the drug. The illegal harvesting of organs and spinal fluid in \\"Bulletface\\" serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the devastating effects of corruption and greed at the expense of innocent individuals.

Question: \\"What rank was Owen at what he did?\\" Context: \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Richard Owen held the rank of a leading naturalist and anatomist in Britain during the 19th century. He was a significant figure in the scientific community, known for his expertise in comparative anatomy and paleontology. Owen's views on the history of life evolved over time, shifting in the 1850s to the belief that life's development was a gradual unfolding of a divine plan. As an influential scientist of his time, his perspectives on evolution and human origins were widely considered and debated. In the context provided, Owen was engaged in a heated debate with other prominent scientists, such as Thomas Huxley, Joseph Hooker, and Charles Darwin, who were advocating for different views on evolution and the origins of species. Owen proposed a concept of evolution that involved a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\" with new species appearing by natural birth. This idea rejected natural selection but supported \\"creation by birth.\\" Owen's views were met with both agreement and criticism from his contemporaries. One major disagreement Owen had with his peers, particularly with Huxley, was about the anatomical similarities between apes and humans. Owen held the view that humans were a separate sub-class, while Huxley believed that humans and apes shared more similarities than Owen was willing to accept. This led to a public dispute, famously known as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question,\\" in which Huxley ultimately proved that Owen was incorrect in his assertion that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. In conclusion, Richard Owen was a leading naturalist and anatomist in Britain, who held a high rank due to his expertise and influence in the scientific community. His beliefs and contributions to the understanding of evolution and human origins were central to the discourse of his time. Although his views were challenged and debated by his contemporaries, his work's significance cannot be denied in shaping the scientific discussions and developments of the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - deep dive - fall - lower - below - sun set Explain why a human would choose \\"sun set\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"sun set\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Context: The question is about what happens at the end of the day after the sun has risen. This context is related to the natural progression of a day, which involves the sun's movement. 2. Familiarity: Most humans have experienced and are familiar with the concept of the sun rising and setting in one day, as it is a part of everyday life on Earth. 3. Process of elimination: - Deep dive: This term usually refers to an extensive or detailed examination of a subject, and it does not relate directly to the sun or the end of the day. - Fall: Although the term can be used to describe a decrease or lowering of something, it doesn't necessarily relate to the sun's position at the end of the day as directly as \\"sun set\\" does. - Lower: While \\"lower\\" can be used to describe the sun's movement at the end of the day, it may still not be as precise as the term \\"sun set\\" which specifically and directly means the time when the sun moves below the horizon. - Below: This term by itself does not provide enough context to explain what happens to the sun at the end of the day, and it leaves the reader guessing about what is going below. Thus, after considering the context, familiarity, and eliminating other options, a human would choose \\"sun set\\" as the best answer to the question.

Try laughing for no reason at all. That's how millions of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy. The first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria.\\"Young children laugh about 300 times a day.

A thinner wire has a higher resistance, making it more difficult for current to flow through it compared to a thicker wire with lower resistance. This increased resistance in thinner wires is due to the smaller cross-sectional area, which forces electrons to more closely interact with the atoms in the wire, leading to collisions and a decrease in the overall current flow. Thicker wires provide a larger cross-sectional area, offering more room for electrons to move, thereby facilitating easier electron flow and lower resistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A suspect in the Thanksgiving night shooting of an 18-year-old at the Riverchase Galleria Mall in Hoover was arrested Thursday in Georgia. The warrant was issued Wednesday for Erron Martez Dequan Brown, 20, in the shooting. He is charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Brian Wilson, the friend of Emantic “EJ” Bradford Jr., 21, who was shot and killed by police after Wilson was shot. His bond is set at 125,000. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed to AL.com Brown has been arrested in South Fulton. Brown was quickly identified as a suspect in the Nov. 22 shooting of Brian Wilson. Authorities withheld his identity while law enforcement officers searched for him. The U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force in Georgia was assisted by Alabama’s Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Authorities said they captured Erron Martez Brown, 20, about 9:30 a.m. Thursday on Highwind Way in South Fulton. Brown will be taken to the South Fulton Police Precinct, where he will be questioned by local and Alabama authorities. U.S. Marshals said Brown was staying at a relative’s house when he was arrested. Jefferson County District Attorney Danny Carr said while charges have been brought against Brown, the state investigation is not complete and remains ongoing. \\"We are confident ALEA is working to complete the investigation in a timely manner,'' Carr said. “However, in light of the fact that so many people were present in the mall that evening, witness interviews are still ongoing.” Court records show Brown previously was arrested in Madison County on May 18, 2017 on a first-degree robbery charge, but that charge was dismissed. Hoover may share mall shooting information if state won’t release video The shooting happened late Thanksgiving night at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover. Police said it began when two men got into a physical altercation and one of the men - now identified as Brown - pulled out a handgun and shot the other man - Wilson. Wilson was shot at least once in the stomach, and taken to a nearby hospital where he remains in serious condition. A 12-year-old bystander, Molly Davis, was also shot and taken to Children’s Hospital by a Hoover Fire Department rescue squad. She has since been released. Authorities have not said who fired the shots that injured Molly. Two officers who were providing security at the mall heard the gunfire and approached the area. They spotted a suspect waving a pistol and shot him. The man, Emantic “EJ” Bradford Jr., 21, died at the scene. Hoover police initially portrayed Bradford as the mall gunman and said officers acted heroically to “take out the threat” within seconds of shots being fired in the crowded mall. They later retracted the statement, and said while Bradford was seen with a handgun, evidence indicates he was not the person who shot the 18-year-old and 12-year-old bystander. Shortly after news of the arrest broke, ALEA spokeswoman Robyn Bryan said the ivestigation is ongoing, including the officer-involved shooting from the same evening and location. Hoover officials apologize to E.J. Bradford’s family for saying he was shooter \\"The cooperation of the Hoover Police Department and Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office has aided in the investigation and the expediency of identifying Brown and effecting his arrest. The SBI is also grateful for the patience shown by the City of Hoover in this process,'' she said. \\"It is highly likely that prematurely releasing information, including video evidence, would have hampered the investigation’s progress thus far, even to the point of deterring key witnesses,'' Bryan said in a prepared statement. \\"As other witnesses continue to come forward, it is imperative for the integrity of the investigation that SBI continue to keep confidential information Agents obtain. “SBI will continue to work efficiently, thoroughly and impartially to bring all relevant facts to light to provide the DA with the most accurate facts and evidence possible in this case,'' said SBI Director John Q. Hamm, also in a prepared statement. \\"This is not just SBI’s commitment to the people of Hoover and Jefferson County, but SBI’s commitment to the citizens of Alabama in all investigations SBI undertakes.” Once Brown’s extradition from Georgia has been affirmed, Brown will be booked into the Jefferson County Jail, Birmingham, under a 150,000 bond. Additional charges are expected as the investigation progresses. Once agents have completed the investigation, the file in its entirety will be turned over to the Tenth Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office. The City of Hoover and the Hoover Police Department expressed their appreciation to U.S. Marshal Marty Keely and the task force for their role in Brown’s arrest. “This is an important milestone in the continued work to find answers about what happened in last Thursday’s tragic incident,'' according to a statement released Thursday afternoon. The Bradford family attorney, Ben Crump, issued this statement following the arrest of Brown: “We are gratified at the arrest of a suspect in the Thanksgiving Riverchase Galleria mall shooting, further underscoring the unjust death of EJ Bradford Jr. at the hands of an off-duty Hoover police officer who was serving as mall security. Right now, EJ’s family is focused on planning their son’s funeral, to be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday at Boutwell Memorial Auditorium. They look forward to reviewing unaltered video evidence of the shooting next week, after properly remembering and honoring EJ and enduring the painful process of burying their son.” Anyone with information regarding the Galleria shooting is asked to call ALEA at 334-462-9163. ||||| Trevor Noah, speaking to his Daily Show audience Tuesday night during an impassioned side monologue on a recent Alabama police shooting, questioned the Second Amendment’s inclusion of black Americans. Addressing the recently admitted police killing of 21-year-old Emantic Bradford Jr., Noah wondered aloud why these situations continue to remain prevalent among American law enforcement. \\"So the question I ask myself is, how does this shit keep happening?\\" he said. \\"That's what they did here, they ran in they shot the guy and they were like 'We got him!' What's wild about the story for me is, even if we work in a world that police truly believe he was the shooter, how many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down, you know what I mean?\\" After referencing the outcomes of the Aurora and Charleston mass shootings, Noah continued: \\"There were so many things that bugged me about this story,\\" he said. \\"From the looks of it, this was a good guy with a gun. That's what they always say, right? 'The good guy with a gun stops the crime.' But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don't get any of the benefits.\\" POST CONTINUES BELOW \\"At this point,\\" Noah later added, \\"you start to realize that, really, the Second Amendment is not intended for black people.\\" See Noah's full Daily Show segment on the shooting up top. In a recent interview with CNN, April Pipkins—Emantic Bradford Jr.'s mother—said an open-casket funeral service was likely not possible due to police shooting her son in the face. \\"I will never be able to see my son's face again or to look into his eyes or to hear him say, 'Mom, I love you,''' she said. While Hoover police originally asserted that Emantic Bradford Jr. had been the gunman involved in a mall shooting, they later changed their story. The actual gunman, per the most recent reports, is apparently still at large. ||||| After a young black man was shot by police at a mall, a community is traumatised as the family demands answers When gunshots were fired near a Footaction store at an upscale mall in Hoover, Alabama, Emantic Bradford Sr heard about it on the local news. After dinner on Thanksgiving, his 21-year-old son and namesake, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr, had gone to that very mall. So Bradford Sr, a retired Birmingham jail employee, called his son. Ring. Ring. Ring. Then voicemail. Though he was exhausted from a latest bout of chemotherapy, Bradford Sr called the Hoover police department in the early hours of Friday morning. “My mind was on my baby,” he told the packed crowd of mostly African Americans at Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist church on Tuesday night, just a few miles from mall. The Hoover police department told Bradford Sr they would call him back in 10 minutes. But no one called back. At 3.43am, Bradford Sr called them again. “I can’t tell you anything,” the person who answered the phone told him, transferring the call to the county, then dispatch and finally a detective on the scene. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emantic Bradford Jr was fatally shot by Birmingham, Alabama, police when they wrongly believed he was the gunman in a shopping mall shooting. Photograph: Emantic Bradford Sr/AP Bradford Sr would, at last, get an answer to where his son was. “He told me direct on the phone. I asked: ‘Is that my child?’ He said: ‘Yes, that’s your son.’” At the time the family found out their son had died, the day after Thanksgiving, the mall reopened at 6am for Black Friday sales. “I called them at 12.30[am]. My child was dead at 9[pm],” Bradford Sr said , his voice cracking, as he stood with family members and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, staring at the crowd gathered in the church. In that time, the city of Hoover, Hoover police and the Riverchase Galleria mall posted updates on social media and held news conferences. But no one had called the dead man’s family. The tragic death has divided a community and the country. Police in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham which is a city symbolic of the civil rights struggle and the fight against racial segregation, shifted the narrative multiple times about how Bradford had died. First, he was identified as the suspect in the shooting. Then they said he wasn’t the suspect but had brandished a gun. Then police backed off that claim too. The real shooter, meanwhile, remains at large. The incident is resonant of many cases of police shootings of young black men, reinforcing a notion that they must behave differently from other races in America’s public spaces – merely to avoid being shot by law enforcement. As the late-night comic Trevor Noah noted in a passionate commentary on the case: “The second amendment is not intended for black people.” Bradford’s death has left many people traumatised, especially those who witnessed the shooting. Rashad Billingsley, 18, an employee of the national guard, had passed two police officers at Footaction shortly after 9pm. He wanted to buy a new pair of red sneakers. Before he could turn his attention to the shoes, he heard two gunshots, just 25ft away. Seconds later, he heard more. (He is unsure about how many.) Billingsley ushered dozens into the back hallway of the store, and helped tend to a 12-year-old girl shot in the back. 'They executed him': police killing of Stephon Clark leaves family shattered Read more He was one of the last to leave the mall, walking out with the older sister and grandmother of the young girl who was shot. Outside Footaction, they saw a young black man covered in blood. “Me and her sister were walking out and she [saw] him out of her peripheral vision. She started crying … I put my arm around her so she couldn’t see the body,” he said, fiddling with his watch. In the immediate aftermath, police did not contact Billingsley, he says. As of Tuesday Billingsley said they still had not spoken to him. Police decisions in the wake of the shooting have come under heavy criticism. That night Hoover police captain Gregg Rector described a physical altercation, an exchange of gunfire, and the death of a suspect engaged by police officers. By Friday morning, Hoover police would identify the dead man as “a 21-year-old male from Hueytown”. Hours later, police released his name as the shooter – before backtracking. They accused Bradford of “brandishing” a gun – and then walked back that description. “This is not a change in the characterization of what he was doing with the gun at the time but rather an attempt to further explain it,” a city spokesperson said in an email. Four days after Bradford’s death, in a joint release with the city of Hoover, police said the shooter “is still at large” – though they provided no description, indirectly admitting they falsely accused Bradford. They offered sympathy to the family, but did not apologize in the statement. Grasping for change on America's most violent streets: 'We must stop killing' Read more The police officer involved in the shooting has yet to be identified by the city or police. “The officer is on paid administrative leave as per normal procedures in a case such as this. This officer has been employed by Hoover police department since 2017 but had several years of police experience prior to that,” the email stated. The timeline remains unclear: officials have released contradictory narratives. Crump, the civil rights attorney, said: “It is so troubling when you think of all the black men across America who have been killed because they moved a certain way. They have a cellphone, it was dark and they couldn’t see.” He then listed African American shooting victims whose families he has represented: Michael Brown in Ferguson; Botham Jean in Dallas; and Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. Crump grew visibly angry as he referenced white, male shooting suspects taken alive by police in recent years: Nikolas Cruz at Parkland this year; and Dylann Roof, who killed nine African American worshippers at a church in Charleston in 2015. Crump said: “When it comes to [Bradford], who several witnesses say was trying to help them escape, help them get out of harm’s way, help them get to safety, police [don’t] see a good guy with a gun, he’s a black man with a gun.” The second amendment is a recipe for police killings | Michael Wood Read more Though the Hoover mall is private property and prohibits firearms, gun laws in Alabama are unclear. State law allows carrying a pistol on private property with a concealed weapon permit. According to Crump, multiple eyewitnesses have come forward, telling him many people inside the mall pulled out guns when the shots rang out. Multiple vigils and protests have sprouted up, and people have demanded officials “release the video”. According to the police, all available video footage is in the possession of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) for the duration of the investigation. Crump told the Guardian: “Nobody has seen the video and that’s the problem because they lied already to this family about proclaiming to the world, assassinating his character while assassinating this person.” The ALEA has not responded to the Guardian’s inquiry. On Monday night, Hoover police officers lined up in front of the station, watching a small crowd of protesters, many carrying signs eliciting deja vu of other officer-involved shooting protests. “Hoover PD believes the second amendment only applies to white civilians,” read one sign. “Black Lives Matter,” read another. “Release the videotapes,” another demanded. Adrienne Matthews, 36, brought her six-year-old and 10-year-old to the protest. “It’s overwhelming, it’s a lot. There’s a lot of [Emantics] out here.” A white police officer whispered to a protester: “I wish it didn’t have to be like this.” Black Lives Matter: birth of a movement | Wesley Lowery Read more “We want justice for EJ,” the crowd chanted, using Bradford’s nickname. Bradford Jr’s cousin, Taunya Bradford McDonald, turned to a police officer and asked: “Why didn’t you have the decency to go to my family and say, ‘Hey, your son was murdered?” She asked: “Do you have any children?” The officer nodded. She continued: “If this happened to your child, wouldn’t you want to know what happened?” Sure, he said to her, still nodding. “I would want answers, just like you,” he began. “We’re human beings, we’re parents, we’re sons, we’re daughters,” he said. Earlier that day, a vigil was held at Veterans Park. Many pastors spoke, but the most resounding words came from a white pastor, David Barnhart of St Junia Methodist church in Birmingham. He said: “Systemic racism is not a black people problem. These are not problems we can help by claiming we don’t see color. These are not problems we can fix by claiming all lives matter.” On Tuesday, five days after their son was shot, Bradford’s family received a call from Hoover police, Crump told the Guardian. The family has also received the body of their dead son, in preparation for his funeral, where the Rev Jesse Jackson will deliver the eulogy, he added. It was all too much for Bradford’s mother. She was the last to address the crowd on Tuesday evening in Birmingham. After holding up a picture of her son, she couldn’t get past her first thought. “Thanksgiving will never be the same,” April Pipkins began. She paused, looked at the ground, rubbed her temples, then collapsed. Faith leaders encircled her, praying as she lay on the floor. The meeting ended and people filed out. And around the corner of the famed church, the mother of a dead young black man was helped on to a stretcher, away from the departing crowd. Her son’s funeral is Saturday morning. ||||| (CNN) April Pipkins is still at a loss for words over the events that led up to her son's fatal shooting Thanksgiving night -- and as outrage grows, she wants people to know that Emantic Bradford Jr. was a loving man. The 21-year-old was killed by a police officer in a case of mistaken identity during a shooting at Alabama's largest enclosed mall Thursday night. Officers initially thought Bradford fired the rounds at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover that left an 18-year-old and a 12-year-old hospitalized, Hoover police spokesman Capt. Gregg Rector said in a statement. \\"I will never be able to see my son's face again or to look into his eyes or to hear him say, 'Mom, I love you,'\\" Pipkins said of her son, adding that he may not be able to have an open-casket funeral because he was shot in the face. \\"I am just at a loss of words right now,\\" she said.

He meets and falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), the sister of the bullying, loud-mouthed landowner Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). Danaher, who had wanted the farm himself, is angry that the Widow Tillane (herself angered by Danaher's admission that he had discussed her in the local pub) accepts Sean's bid, and retaliates by refusing consent for his sister to marry. Several town locals, including the Catholic priest, Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), conspire to trick him into believing that the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) wants to marry him, but only if Mary Kate is no longer living in his house. After learning the truth on Sean and Mary Kate's wedding day, an enraged Will refuses to give his sister her dowry which is made up of a large sum of money and her family possessions passed down from her mother. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride. She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean. Angered and shamed by Sean's refusal to confront her brother and demand what is legally hers, she brands him a coward, and, despite living together, they are quickly estranged as husband and wife.

By Daily Mail Reporter Last updated at 5:04 PM on 21st June 2011 New details have emerged of how seriously the British government was bracing itself for a full scale nuclear crisis in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. Documents show how advisers rushed to work out how bad the crisis might get, and the plans drawn up for 'the worst case scenario' to protect British citizens - including the British Embassy in Tokyo issuing iodine pills to expats and visitors in the capital and Sendai, 70 miles from Fukushima. The government's emergency committee Cobra were also on standby to screen passengers landing at Heathrow from Japan for radioactive contamination, it has been revealed. However, the accident was not expected to be as bad as OPTIONS: - British. - British Embassy. - Chernobyl. - Cobra. - Daily Mail. - Fukushima. - Heathrow. - Japan. - Sendai. - Tokyo.","completion":"the Chernobyl disaster, which took place in 1986 in Ukraine. Nonetheless, the British government understood the severity of the situation at Fukushima, and they did not want to take any chances when it came to the safety of their citizens, both in Japan and those who might be returning to the United Kingdom. In the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, British experts in various fields, including nuclear safety, public health, and disaster response, were quickly assembled to assess the situation and provide guidance to the government on how to best handle the potential threat. This careful and well-coordinated response is a testament to the UK's commitment to ensuring the wellbeing of their people in the face of a potential nuclear crisis. One of the key actions taken by the British Embassy in Tokyo was the distribution of iodine pills to British expats and visitors in both the capital city and Sendai, which was located just 70 miles from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The iodine pills were meant to protect the individuals from the harmful effects of radioactive iodine, which can be released into the environment during a nuclear event. Radioactive iodine can be absorbed by the thyroid gland and lead to thyroid cancer or other serious health complications. Distributing these pills was a proactive measure to minimize the potential health impact on British citizens who were in close proximity to the affected area. Another major plan that was put in place as part of the UK's response to the Fukushima disaster was the activation of the government's emergency committee Cobra. This committee was prepared to screen passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport from Japan for any radioactive contamination. This step was essential to ensuring that individuals who had potentially been exposed to radiation during their time in Japan were identified and appropriately treated or quarantined to protect the wider population in the UK. The detailed documentation on the British government's response to the Fukushima disaster highlights the importance that national authorities place on preparing for and addressing nuclear crises. The UK's efforts to protect their citizens extended beyond their borders and demonstrated their resolve to take all necessary measures to minimize the potential impact of such an event on their people. Although the Fukushima disaster did not reach the magnitude of the Chernobyl catastrophe, the British government's response showcases their commitment to the safety and wellbeing of their nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is advised to \\"look beyond what you see\\"? Timon and Pumbaa watch the original film in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to his scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa in the original film, and are thrown off a waterfall.

Article: Story highlights Trump tweeted, 'James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!' Former FBI Director James Comey said in his testimony, 'Lordy, I hope there are tapes' Washington (CNN) For President Richard Nixon, the controversy over his secret White House tape recordings began with a break-in at the Watergate Hotel. If President Donald Trump is also keeping recordings of his conversations, any controversy over those will have begun with a tweet. On May 12, three days after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump tweeted: \\"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\\" Since then, the possible existence of audio recordings of Oval Office conversations have been a topic of conversation among many on Capitol Hill. The House intelligence committee has called on both the White House and Comey to hand over any material related to its Russia investigation, including memos and recordings, by June 23. But two questions remain: Are there actually audio recordings? And, if so, do Trump and the White House have to hand them over? \\"The short version is, if there are tapes, and if they are subpoenaed, I think the White House will probably have to turn them over,\\" said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN legal analyst.

The agency’s response to a freedom of information request submitted by The Wall Street Journal doesn’t exclude the possibility that recordings could have been created by another entity. The Secret Service handled recording systems within the White House for past presidents, including Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. The question of a White House recording system has lingered for more than a month since Mr. Trump first raised the possibility in a provocative tweet about former FBI Director James Comey. In recent days, the two men have offered differing accounts of whether Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey in private conversations within the White House complex to ease off the FBI’s probe of former national security adviser Mike Flynn. On Friday, Mr. Trump kept the tapes mystery alive, telling reporters in the White House Rose Garden, “I’ll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future.” He added, “Oh, you’re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don’t worry.” White House aides have declined to answer questions about whether there are tapes, with press secretary Sean Spicer saying he was “not aware” and his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, saying she didn’t know and then quipping she would “look under the couches” to check. At a cabinet meeting Monday, Mr. Trump didn’t respond to a shouted question from a reporter about whether there were tapes. And at the White House daily briefing on Monday, Mr. Spicer said: “The president made clear in the Rose Garden last week that he would have an announcement shortly.” The Secret Service on Monday sent its reply to a May 15 request from the Journal that sought recordings or transcripts of any recordings made after Jan. 20 within the White House. “In response to your request, the Secret Service has conducted a reasonable search for responsive records,” the agency wrote. “It appears, from a review of Secret Service’s main indices, that there are no records pertaining to your request that are referenced in these indices.” Such records would typically be subject to the Presidential Records Act, and turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration at the end of a president’s time in office. The National Archives and Records Administration said in response to a request from the Journal that any presidential records aren’t subject to FOIA while the president is in office. Most parts of the White House itself are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.

First, let's analyze the initial sentence: \\"A little girl is standing next to a snowman that is taller than her.\\" This statement provides some specific details: 1. There is a little girl involved. 2. The little girl is standing. 3. There is a snowman present. 4. The snowman is taller than the girl. Now, let's look at the sentence in question: \\"A human standing.\\" This sentence is a very general statement, which only mentions that there is a human who is standing. It does not provide specific details about the human, such as their size, gender, or location. Comparing the two sentences, we can conclude that \\"A human standing\\" is a true sentence, as the little girl from the initial sentence is, in fact, a human. Moreover, she is not just a human, but a human who is standing. However, it is crucial to consider that the sentence \\"A human standing\\" is very vague and does not convey any specific information about the human in question. Therefore, while the sentence is true as it relates to the initial statement, it lacks context and specificity when considered as a standalone sentence. For a more accurate representation of the information given in the first sentence, the second sentence could be revised as follows: \\"A little girl is standing.\\" This allows the reader to understand that the standing human is a girl and is specific enough to connect with the initial sentence."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write the answer: Which chemical element has the symbol 'Ce'?","completion":"The chemical element with the symbol 'Ce' is Cerium. Cerium is a rare earth metal that is silvery-white in appearance and belongs to the lanthanide series of the periodic table. It was first discovered in 1803 by Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, as well as independently by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. Cerium is the 58th element in the periodic table with the atomic number 58. It has an atomic mass of approximately 140.12 atomic mass units. This metal is relatively soft and can be easily cut with a knife. Cerium has several important characteristics, including its ability to rapidly tarnish when exposed to air, the formation of a protective oxide layer, and a high reactivity with water, which results in the release of hydrogen gas. In terms of its electronic configuration, Cerium has two stable isotopes: Ce-140, which is the most abundant with a natural occurrence of about 88.5%, and Ce-142 with an abundance of about 11.1%. Cerium's electronic configuration can be represented as [Xe] 4f1 5d1 6s2. Cerium's uses and applications are primarily in the field of metallurgy and the production of various alloys. One of its most common and important uses is as an alloying agent in the manufacturing of aluminum, iron, and magnesium alloys. These alloys offer enhanced materials properties, such as increased strength and resistance to both corrosion and high-temperature oxidation. In addition, Cerium plays an important role in the production of flints for cigarette lighters and gas stove igniters due to its pyrophoric nature. It is used in the making of a material called Mischmetal, which is an alloy containing 50% Cerium along with Lanthanum, Neodymium, and other rare earth elements. This material is employed in several applications, including the manufacturing of lighter flints and as a component in various electronic devices. Furthermore, Ce is employed as a catalyst in various chemical reactions, such as the production of hydrogen from water, air-pollution control, and refining crude oil. In the glass industry, Cerium oxide is used as a polishing agent for glass surfaces and as an opacifying agent that imparts a yellow color. Cerium oxide is also utilized as a catalyst to reduce harmful emissions in automotive exhaust systems. In summary, the chemical element with the symbol 'Ce' is Cerium, a rare earth metal that boasts a wide variety of uses and applications in metallurgy, lighter flints, and as a catalyst in various industries.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people who Palmer said were obvious influences to Curtis? from the following article ? Curtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \\"obvious influences\\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse.Curtis was unwilling to explain the meaning behind his lyrics and Joy Division releases were absent of any lyric sheets. He told the fanzine Printed Noise, \\"We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\\" The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis' lyrics. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they \\"just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion.\\" Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise \\"[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics\\".

Write an article based on this summary: Campaigners against plans to build a row of 30 colourful beach huts on a stretch of shoreline in Moray hope to take their fight to the Court of Session. Article:","completion":"Title: A Battle Beyond the Beach: Moray Shoreline Campaigners Head to Court of Session The sleepy, picturesque coastline of Moray in Scotland is home to stunning landscapes, rich history, and a welcoming community. However, recent plans to construct a row of 30 colourful beach huts has sparked a controversial debate that has extended far beyond the sand and splendour of the Moray shore. The said proposal has faced strong opposition from a group of campaigners who have sworn to take their fight to the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme court, in order to contest the potential impact that the construction could have on the shoreline's natural beauty, local residents, and the environment. It all began when a development company submitted plans to build a series of striking, colourfully-designed beach huts on the shoreline of Moray. The project was deemed an attractive addition to the popular coastal area that could potentially boost tourism and provide revenue opportunities to local businesses. However, this seemingly innocent and vibrant proposal swiftly turned into a major source of contention among locals and environmentalists alike. The group of campaigners opposing the project argue that the construction of these beach huts will significantly alter the landscape, disrupt the natural habitat of local wildlife, and also reduce the scenic value of the Moray coastline. Furthermore, they claim that the increased tourism brought on by the huts would exacerbate existing crowd issues at the shoreline, putting infrastructure under strain, and adding to a rise in noise and waste pollution. On the other hand, proponents of the project present a different perspective. They believe that the beach huts, beyond offering tourists an appealing design aesthetic, would also create new job opportunities for the local area, boosting Moray's economy and increasing its appeal to visitors. In the midst of this heated and emotionally-charged conflict, the campaigners against the beach huts construction have ultimately decided to wage a legal battle in the Court of Session to reverse the approval given to the project. According to them, the due process in approving the plans has not been followed correctly and giving a nod to the construction could set a dangerous precedent for similar development projects on Scotland's coastlines in the future. Notwithstanding the merit of both arguments, the decision of the Court of Session would certainly set a benchmark for how much importance is being given to environmental concerns, local sentiments, and democratic deliberation in the face of potential commercial gains. As locals and environmentalists wait with bated breath for the Court of Session to weigh in on this contentious issue, the debate over the proposed beach huts has ignited an even larger discussion beyond the Moray shores - the question of how to balance sustainable tourism, environmental protection, and local community needs in the face of modern-day development challenges. While we may not have a definitive answer to this question, the Moray shoreline case serves as a vital reminder that the decisions we make today, in seeking to find the right balance between progress and preservation, will have rippling effects on our landscapes, communities, and future generations for years to come. No matter the outcome of the legal battle, one thing remains certain: the controversy surrounding the Moray beach huts has left an indelible mark on Scotland's coastal communities and has ignited a much-needed conversation about the importance of preserving the authenticity and beauty of our cherished shorelines."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.

Available choices: I. negative; II. positive; Short movie review: an unsuccessful attempt Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"In this case, the critic's view of the movie is negative. The phrase \\"an unsuccessful attempt\\" implies that the short movie did not reach its intended goals or achieve its expected potential. The critic seems to believe that the film was not successful in delivering its message or story effectively. Overall, the tone of the review indicates that the individual did not have a positive experience while watching the movie. It is essential to note that reviews can vary greatly from one person to another, and a negative review does not necessarily mean that everyone will have the same opinion about the film. However, the critic's specific mention of an \\"unsuccessful attempt\\" clearly indicates that they did not enjoy the movie, and they likely would not recommend it to others. This suggests that the overall interest, plot development, character depth, cinematic technique, and other elements of the film may not have come together well for this critic. When considering the available choices of either I. negative or II. positive, it is evident that the critic was thinking negatively of the movie. This information can be helpful in understanding the particular perspective of the critic and whether or not the film may be enjoyable for individual preferences. However, it is essential to keep in mind that movies are subjective, and what may not work for one person could resonate strongly with another. In conclusion, based on the short movie review mentioning \\"an unsuccessful attempt,\\" the critic's thoughts on the film can be categorized as negative. While this may affect the movie's perception for some potentially interested viewers, it is a reminder that opinions on art forms such as film can greatly differ. Seeking a variety of opinions and possibly sampling the movie before investing time and emotional investment in it can provide a better overall understanding and ultimately more satisfaction in the viewer's movie-watching experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How drug cartels are like big box stores In his new book Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel, Britain editor for The Economist,Tom Wainwright argues that drug cartels have taken cues from big corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonalds, on everything from creating brand value to outsourcing. He also says governments are getting the economics of the drug trade wrong when it comes to the war on drugs. Here's his conversation with Brent. BRENT BAMBURY: Tom Wainwright, you visited the three countries where cocaine originates: Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. And governments there are aggressively destroying coca plantations. It's a kind of ground war that's trying to damage the cartels and the cocaine business. But the price of cocaine hasn't changed in twenty years. So why isn't this ground war working? TOM WAINWRIGHT: Well on the face of it looks as if it's working rather well. When you go there and you see these guys in action ripping up the coca plants and dumping weedkiller on them. But the trouble is, the price in the United States and Canada are and year hasn't really changed much at all. And the reason is that the coca itself, although it is the principal ingredient of cocaine, it doesn't really actually make much of the final price. Picture the art market. If you want to drive up the price of paintings. You might say well paint is the main ingredient of painting so let's try and double the price of a box of paint. If you did that and a box of paints cost one hundred dollars rather than fifty dollars, you wouldn't expect the price of a million dollar painting to double to two million dollars right? The real value of cocaine lies in the fact that it smuggled thousands of miles. The actual raw ingredient isn't really where the value lies. Even if you do manage to increase the price of drugs. Demand on the whole stays pretty pretty steady. The consumption doesn't really change. And so all you really end up doing is increase the value of the criminal market. That's why I think it would be much better to focus on the demand side because if you can cut consumption if you can persuade people not to take those drugs, then they'll take fewer of them. And it will drive down the price. BB: Some of the economic models that you create to describe the supply side are pretty interesting. You compare the relationship between the growers and the cartels to the business model of Wal-Mart. Why is that? TW: If you look at Wal-Mart you find that even if there's a big interruption to the supply of one of their products -- so let's say the harvest for apples fails, miraculously the price of apples in the store tends to stay pretty much the same. And the suppliers complain that they are the ones who really suffer. And the reason, it's claimed, that this happens is that Wal-Mart has what's called a monopsony. So effectively a monopoly on buying these products. And what this means is that the farmers can't offer the product to anybody else at a higher price. Wal-Mart is really the only buyer in town and so they have to continue giving the product to Wal-Mart at the price that Wal-Mart demands. Something vaguely similar is happening actually in the cocaine business. In the areas where coca leaf is grown you find a single cartel or a single armed group is the only buyer of coca leaf in town and so if there's an interruption to the supply, the coca farmers aren't able to increase their prices because there's only one buyer and that means that the people who suffer from the efforts to destroy coca crops and not the drug cartels. It's the farmers in places like Bolivia who grow the stuff and earn a dollar a day. Robes with Maltese crosses, guns, munitions and Knights Templar paraphernalia are shown after a training camp was discovered following a firefight between Mexican army soldiers and gunmen in the woods near the town of Santa Gertrudis in July 2011. (Associated Press) BB: You find lots of parallels to respectable business practices in the cartels' business models. The Zetas are one of Mexico's most and notorious cartels. And you compare their growth to that of McDonald's restaurants. So what makes those two similar? TW: Well quite often you find when the Mexican police raid a branch of the Zetas, they go in and they find all this branded stuff. It's incredible. The Zetas have these baseball caps with the letters Z on them. And I should say that Zeta is just the Spanish for the letter Z. And so that's their logo. And so they find the branded baseball caps and t-shirts they find all kinds of things like this and the way the gang has spread is very similar to the way in which any other franchise spreads. The main headquarters licenses the brand -- the name Zetas to local criminal groups. And those criminal gangs can use the name. Which helps them a lot in their extortion efforts. And in return these groups return a share of their profits to the main main headquarters and that's how they manage to grow so quickly. BB: You went to Juarez, Mexico at the height of the violence there. And you say that the cartels there were warring over control of the border crossings to bring drugs by land into the world's largest market for these drugs which is the United States. So the human cost is extremely high. How would you change that? TW: People are coming up with various different ways of trying to tackle the drug problem and one of the most interesting ones at the moment actually is what's going on in a few American States and in Uruguay and soon, we're told in Canada or and that's this experiment with legalization. The idea there is to take the market out of the hands of the cartels. And in the case of Mexico for instance there are some cartels which rely on marijuana for nearly half of their revenues. And by legalizing the drug and putting it in the hands of ordinary businesses that market has been removed from those cartels and we're already actually seeing evidence that the Mexican cartels are really suffering as a result of this. If you go to places like Tijuana which is right on the border with the United States, the police there are more frequently finding very very large dumps of marijuana stashed there which it seems the cartels are having difficulty selling north of the border. One observation that I made during the book is that people think that they can reduce the risk of violence spilling over into the United States by closing down border crossings. In fact I think the economic logic suggests the opposite. If you have more border crossings. Then it means that the premium on controlling each one is greatly reduced and so the need for cartels to fight over one city or another is diminished. DATE IMPORTED:August 10, 2010Military officers count money seized during an operation at a military zone on the outskirts of Monterrey August 10, 2010. The army seized 27,211 and 16,539,690 million pesos (1,306,290) in drug money, three vehicles, jewellery, weapons, 200 kilos of packed marijuana, a minor quantity of cocaine and eight detainees during an operation in the suburb of Guadalupe, according to local media. REUTERS/Tomas Bravo (Tomas Bravo/Reuters) BB: In Mexico, you argue that cartels win over locals by carrying out acts of corporate social responsibility. Can you tell me about the cleaning lady that you met Mexico City and how she got involved with a cartel? TW: This was a lady who was in her perhaps seventies or eighties nd she wasn't the kind of person that you would normally expect to be involved in organized crime at all. She was a very kind of friendly, cozy kind of person. And when I went to interview her and she told me that she was planning to have somebody murdered. And I said why are you doing this what's going on? The problem was that in her neighbourhood there was a gang of criminals that was going around robbing people's homes and beating people up and in some cases killing people. And local people had gone to the police and said look, you've got to do something about this. You've got to stop these guys. And the police were corrupt they were inefficient they were lazy they did nothing. And so the local drug cartel stepped in and said 'hey look we're quite good at sorting out this kind of thing you know we can take care of this problem'. And there last I heard, they were about to take care of it. This is the kind of thing that the cartels sometimes do to try and win over the support of local people by, for instance, building churches and building sports fields and things. It helps to persuade some people that they're not all bad and it's important to be clear that they are very much all bad. BB: But for people in poverty the cartels are extremely attractive. Especially young people. Tell me about the young assassin that you met in Guatemala. TW: Sure well I was in Guatemala looking at the way in which some of these cartels do a kind of off-shoring and seeking cheaper places to do business. And this was a guy that I met he was I believe about eighteen years old although he looked so much younger. He'd been suffering from malnutrition which had stunted his growth. And I remember as he was describing to me his job, which was working as a hit man, I saw that he was wearing children sized shoes with velcro straps. It was the most extraordinary contrast of innocence and terrible experience. And the way that the cartels had taking advantage of this guy really illustrated the way in which they move into countries where the cost of employing people to do this kind of work is low where the rule of law is very very weak. BB: A chapter of your book is devoted to to another parallel drug selling system and that's the dark web on sites like the now defunct Silk Road. Tell me how those sites have had an impact on the business and the the practices of the cartels. TW: In just the same way that Amazon.com for instance has made life much harder for book stores, the dark web and sites like the Silk Road has made life much harder for street drug dealers. They offer drugs at lower prices and they offer them a higher quality. And there's this sort of feedback mechanism where when you go on to the site, they look a lot like a site like e-Bay for instance. People can leave reviews of the products and to the established dealers this represents a big new competitor because for many people it's going to seem easier to buy drugs online like that and safer and more reassuring than it is walking down a dark alley with a stranger. And so I think the cartels actually have a real threat on their hands with this. BB: In April the UN's going to host a special assembly about fighting the global trade in drugs. What's one immediate thing that you think governments could do to disrupt the cartels right now and to make things safer. TW: Well the big step would be legalization but I think for countries that aren't ready to do anything quite like that there are lots of smaller things that they could do. And one of those really lies in prisons. That's one of the most extraordinary experiences that I had when I was reporting this book. I went to visit one of the leaders of one of the main drug dealing gangs in El Salvador. He was in jail at the time although it wasn't stopping him from running his business it seemed. And he was one of these extraordinary guys covered in tattoos literally from head to toe. And we sat down and we talked business. And he was complaining that one of the great problems for him is with human resources -- that they find it very difficult to hire new people because of course, they're continually losing employees to to murder or to arrest. But fortunately for them, we've invented these things called prisons which are collections of unemployed young men with criminal records and absolutely nothing to do, who were there at the disposal of the cartels. And if you're not a member of one of these gangs when you go into prison then you certainly will be by the time you leave. And so I think one area where governments could probably do more is to make these prisons less conducive to a gang joining. And the way to do that is to make them safer so people don't need to join gangs for their own protection. BB: Tom Wainwright, thank you for being with us. TW: Thank you very much.

The commission had ordered the LSE to sell its 60% stake in MTS, a fixed-income trading platform. However, the LSE said the request was \\"disproportionate\\". It warned investors it would struggle to sell MTS and that such a sale would harm its ongoing business. As a result, the LSE said: \\"Based on the commission's current position, LSE believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger.\\" The two rival exchanges announced plans for a \\"merger of equals\\" about a year ago, aiming to create a giant trading powerhouse that would better compete against US rivals. They had already agreed to sell part of LSE's clearing business, LCH, to satisfy competition concerns before the commission's surprise demand concerning MTS earlier this month. The Commission had given the exchanges until Monday to come up with a proposal to meet that demand. LSE said that such a sale would need regulatory approval from several European governments and would hurt its wider Italian business. \\"Taking all relevant factors into account, and acting in the best interests of shareholders, the LSE Board today concluded that it could not commit to the divestment of MTS,\\" the exchange said on Sunday night. When the London Stock Exchange trumpeted its merger with Deutsche Boerse last year, the chairman, Donald Brydon, was remarkably relaxed about the Brexit vote. He and his German counterparts said the deal would go ahead regardless of the outcome. What they didn't know was that it would eventually fall foul of another aspect of the single market - Brussels' control of competition laws. The two sides have made no bones about the fact the merger would create a company with a powerful presence in key markets, and have offered a number of sops to competition authorities in an attempt to win their approval. But it was not enough; Brussels insisted the LSE cede control of MTS, an important Italian clearing house with a crucial role in the trading of Italian government debt. For the LSE board, this was a step too far. A sale of MTS would be too harmful, the directors decided, and they have chosen not to meet an European deadline to say how they would get rid of it. The Brits say they want to go ahead with the merger, but it looks like an insurmountable obstacle. The LSE will either go it alone in a post-Brexit world, or - as has often seemed possible before, and even more so now - fall into the arms of one of the giant American exchanges. MTS is a relatively small part of LSE's business, but it is a major platform for trading European government bonds, particularly in Italy, where it is classified as a \\"systemically important regulated business\\". The LSE group also owns the Milan-based Borsa Italiana. The LSE said it remained convinced about the merits of a merger, but joining forces with Deutsche Boerse would be impossible unless the commission changed its stance. Deutsche Boerse said on Sunday night that it and the LSE would await a further assessment by the European Commission, which was expected to make a decision by the end of March. Syed Kamall, MEP for London and a member of the European Parliament's financial services committee, told the BBC: \\"I think this is good news for competition, and it's also good news for those who are worried that some business in London might be moved to Frankfurt via the back door.\\" The European Commission declined to comment. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3% on the news.","completion":"The proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse is unlikely to be approved, according to the LSE, as the exchange refuses to sell its 60% stake in fixed-income trading platform, MTS, which the European Commission has ordered it to divest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album? Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

Answer a question about this article: Eisenhower, as well as the officers and troops under him, had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations, and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault. His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord. Admiral Ernest J. King fought with Eisenhower over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific. He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did. Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed. He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy. What were the French resistance to be used for in advance of the invasion of France?","completion":"In advance of the invasion of France, specifically Operation Overlord, the French Resistance forces were to be used for covert and sabotage operations against the Germans. These operations were essential to the success of the Normandy invasion. Eisenhower argued with Roosevelt to reach an agreement with Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French Forces, to coordinate these efforts. The French Resistance consisted of various groups of individuals and organizations who fought against the German occupation of France during World War II. Their role in advance of the invasion of France was crucial, as they helped gather vital intelligence about German defenses, troop movements, and logistics. They also sabotaged German infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and telecommunication systems, which would hinder the German ability to mobilize and efficiently counter the Allied invasion. By conducting these covert actions, the French Resistance aimed to weaken the German forces, disrupt their communication and transportation networks, and create confusion and chaos before the actual landing of the Allied troops in Normandy. This way, their efforts would facilitate the success of the invasion and ultimately contribute to the liberation of France from German occupation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry. Tricked by a prison guard into calling off a hunger strike by being promised a thanksgiving-style feast, they go to the mess hall, only to be served the usual drab fare. Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon.

Article:","completion":"Title: Master the Art of Parting and Sectioning Your Hair for Flawless Styles Introduction: Perfectly parting and sectioning your hair is an art that not only ensures your hairstyle looks fabulous, but also makes styling your hair significantly easier. Whether you're aiming for a simple side-part or dividing your locks into sections for a more complex updo, being able to effectively part and section your hair is essential. In this article, we will guide you through step-by-step methods to achieve expert-level hair parting and sectioning, along with tips to ensure fantastic results every time. Step 1: Choose the Right Tools For an efficient and precise parting and sectioning experience, invest in a rat-tail comb, which simplifies the process and provides perfectly straight lines. Additionally, consider using hair clips or bobby pins to keep your sections in place while you work. Step 2: Create a Starter Part Before sectioning your hair, you need to create a \\"starter part\\" as a reference point to guide your future sections. To do this, comb your hair carefully to remove any knots or tangles. Then, using the tail-end of your rat-tail comb, create a part by dragging it along your scalp from your forehead to the nape of your neck, dividing your haircut into two equal halves. Step 3: Decide on Your Preferred Part and Section Location Depending on the final hairstyle you are aiming for, decide whether you'd like a center, side or deep side part. Align your part with one of the high points of your eyebrows to find the most flattering location and use the previously created starter part as a foundation. Step 4: Section Your Hair Now that you have determined your desired part location, it's time to start sectioning. Follow these steps to section your hair for styling: 1. Begin by dividing your hair into four main sections. Section off the front two quarters by creating a part that runs from your hairline at the crown down to your ear on both sides. Clip each quarter section to keep them separate. 2. Create another part in the back of your head by dividing the remaining hair down the middle vertically, resulting in two equally sized sections. Clip these sections separately as well. 3. Depending on your chosen hairstyle, further section your hair by dividing the front quarters into smaller sections and securing them with clips or pins. This allows for easier styling and manages your hair. Step 5: Comb and Style Your Sections Now that your hair is properly parted and sectioned, comb and style each individual section as desired. Take care not to mix sections to maintain a neat and organized look. Conclusion: Parting and sectioning your hair may seem like a minor aspect of hairstyling; however, it greatly impacts the final result. With practice and patience, you can become an expert at parting and sectioning, allowing for a seamless and stunning hairstyle every time. By following these simple steps and using the right tools, you'll be on your way to becoming a master of hair parting and sectioning in no time."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most logical next event? How to fly in your dreams Visualize flight. Surround yourself with images of flight. Watch films of different kinds of flying: superhero-style flying, birds flying, and people flying with devices.","completion":"The most logical next event after surrounding yourself with images of flight is to practice dream control and lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is the ability to become aware that you're dreaming while remaining asleep. When you are aware that you are dreaming, you can then control and manipulate aspects of your dream, such as flying. By taking the steps to learn and practice lucid dreaming, you can unlock the ability to fly in your dreams. Here is a detailed guide on how to achieve lucid dreaming and flying in your dreams: 1. Dream Journaling: Keep a dream journal by your bedside and write down your dreams immediately upon waking up. This will help you remember your dreams and improve dream recall. Recording your dreams also strengthens the connection between your waking and dreaming states, making it easier to become lucid during a dream. 2. Reality Checks: Perform regular reality checks throughout the day to establish a consistent habit. Reality checks help you question your surroundings, making it more likely that you'll recognize the anomalies of a dream state while asleep. Common reality checks include pushing your fingers through your palm or reading text and looking away to see if it changes when you look back. 3. Meditation and Mindfulness: Engaging in regular meditation can help improve your ability to become lucid in your dreams. Meditation practices such as focusing on your breath and observing your thoughts without judgment will enhance your self-awareness and strengthen your connection to your inner self. Practicing mindfulness throughout the day can also help to sharpen your awareness, making it more likely that you will notice when you are dreaming. 4. Sleep Hygiene: Having a proper sleep schedule can make it easier to become lucid in your dreams. Ensure that you are getting enough sleep each night and try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. A well-rested mind is more likely to become lucid during dreams and be able to control the events within them. 5. Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) Technique: The WBTB technique involves waking up after about five or six hours of sleep, staying awake for a short period (15-60 minutes), and then going back to sleep. By interrupting your sleep, you increase the chances of entering a REM sleep period, during which lucid dreams are most likely to occur. 6. Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) Technique: Before going to sleep, repeat a mantra such as, \\"I will become aware that I'm dreaming\\" or \\"I will fly in my dreams tonight.\\" This intention-setting practice helps to create a mental habit that increases the likelihood of becoming lucid during a dream. 7. Visualization: Once you achieve lucidity in a dream, visualize yourself flying. Start by imagining yourself hovering just a few inches above the ground. Gradually increase your height and speed as you gain confidence and control over your dream. You can visualize environments that inspire flight, such as vast open spaces, the sky, or clouds. 8. Experiment with Different Techniques: Understand that each individual is different, and various techniques may be more effective for some than others. Be open to experimentation, and adjust your approach based on your experiences and successes. Remember that practice and patience are key when learning how to fly in your dreams. It may take some time to develop the necessary skills to achieve lucidity and cultivate dream control. Maintaining a persistent and consistent effort in practicing these techniques will eventually enable you to experience the exhilarating sensation of flight within your dreams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Although her mother was Egyptian, Diana considers herself part of the British upper class. At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab, a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing women tourists and freeing them from some of their jewelry. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana and soon talks his way into becoming her official guide and driver in Egypt. While touring the Pyramids, Jamil manages to be alone with Diana and romances her with love songs. Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fiancé's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent. Later Jamil uses his position as a servant to enter Diana's hotel bedroom, and kisses her in a moment of passion. Although she briefly returns his kiss, Diana angrily fires him. Soon after, she and Gerald set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide. Undaunted by Diana's rejection, Jamil follows and soon replaces the new guide. That night, Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, who is drawn into his arms again.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How is Lumpus scared of after Lazlo goes missing? The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

Context: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Let's break down the sentence to analyze its content further: 1. \\"Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England\\": This part of the sentence only informs us about Humphrey Gilbert's fate during his return journey to England and indicates that he did not make it back alive. However, it does not provide information about his second destination or any travels beyond England. 2. \\"was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh\\": This segment of the sentence tells us that after Gilbert's death, his half-brother Walter Raleigh took over his endeavors. Still, it does not offer details about Gilbert's destinations during his travels. 3. \\"who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584\\": This part informs us of Walter Raleigh's patent awarded by Elizabeth in 1584. Again, this statement does not furnish any information about Humphrey Gilbert's second destination. The question regarding Humphrey Gilbert's second destination asks about a specific location that was the focus of his journey following his initial departure from England. The provided sentence, however, does not share any details about any travel destinations other than England.

It is claimed that he subjected his wife, Stephanie Lizon, to years of brutal abuse and forced labor. Among the horrifying claims are that Peter violently kicked Stephanie in the stomach, causing her to endure a miscarriage, and forced her to give birth to another child while shackled. The police investigation also adds that Lizon allegedly ran over his wife’s feet with a tractor. According to the reports and evidence gathered, Peter Lizon repeatedly referred to his wife as his \\"slave\\" and demanded that she kneel before him. The authorities were alerted to this grave situation after Stephanie managed to escape from their West Virginia home, confiding in a local shelter worker about the abuse she had suffered. Investigators disclosed during the court hearing the horrifying extent of the abuse, claiming that photographs of the injuries Stephanie Lizon sustained over time demonstrated proof of the sadistic domestic torment she was subjected to. The heartbreaking scenario continued with investigators stating that besides physical abuse, Stephanie was psychologically tormented and demeaned by her husband. The chilling phone records reveal a chilling picture of a woman held captive in her own home, consistently being reminded by Peter of his supposed ownership over her. Given the harrowing nature of the allegations, the case has sparked a nationwide discussion about domestic violence and abuse, highlighting the desperate need for intervention and support for the victims of such heinous acts. The call for a support system that will allow victims to find solace and support while exposing their abusers has never been louder. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the attorney representing Peter Lizon has stated that Stephanie is denying any claims of abuse, and the couple intend to \\"fight the charges together.\\" The defense claims that the evidence provided by the shelter worker is not only unreliable, but also contains a series of inaccuracies. They now aim to question the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses and the overall viability of the case against Lizon. The case is ongoing, with both the prosecution and defense teams fiercely advocating for their respective sides. As the chilling details of Peter Lizon's alleged abuse come to light, the nation is left grappling with the stark reality of the horrifying experiences that some individuals may endure within their own homes. The Lizon case underscores the importance of recognizing the signs of domestic abuse and understanding that no individual should suffer in silence. As new details about Peter Lizon's alleged crimes unfold, it is hoped that the case will prompt increased dialogue around domestic violence and encourage victims to seek help and find a safe space for healing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. Context: On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. This win represented the first time the Cardinals had won a post-season home game since the 1947 NFL Championship Game. On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33-13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots. On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner is one of three quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two different teams (the others are Craig Morton [1970: Dallas Cowboys and 1977: Denver Broncos] and Peyton Manning [2006 & 2009: Indianapolis Colts and 2013 & 2015: Denver Broncos]). Warner also became the third quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship with two different teams (following Craig Morton and Earl Morrall). In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1-2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had now recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Warner had taken his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games. Question: Did they win any other games. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, during Kurt Warner's career with the St. Louis Rams, New York Giants, and Arizona Cardinals, his teams won numerous games in both the regular season and the playoffs. Apart from the playoff games mentioned in the context, Warner enjoyed significant success with the St. Louis Rams. Most notably, he led the team to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV on January 30, 2000, defeating the Tennessee Titans 23-16. In that game, Warner completed 24 of 45 passes for 414 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Super Bowl record for most passing yards in a single game at the time. He also won the Super Bowl MVP award for his performance. During his time with the Rams, which spanned from 1998 to 2003, Warner led the team to two Super Bowl appearances and achieved numerous individual accolades. Together with running back Marshall Faulk, wide receivers Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt, and offensive tackle Orlando Pace, Warner was part of the Rams' offense known as \\"The Greatest Show on Turf,\\" which became one of the most prolific and dynamic offenses in NFL history. In terms of regular-season success, Warner's career includes 103 victories in the games he started as a quarterback. His overall career statistics feature 32,344 passing yards, 208 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 65.5%.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A young boy, Mikey, sets newspapers on fire in his basement. He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother admonishes him. His foster mother Grace Kelvin disciplines him and he yells at Beth, taking her doll and throwing it in the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey causes her to fall into the pool and drown. Mikey is secretly taping everything. He goes upstairs and overhears his mother telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey was a bad idea. The phone dies and Mikey walks in. Startled, his mother yells at him to get out. Mikey picks up her blow dryer and turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it and she is instantly electrocuted. Mikey goes downstairs and pours a bunch of marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he rushed out to greet him as if nothing has happened. They sit and chat for a moment when he sees his dead daughter floating lifeless in the pool. In a frantic state he rushes towards the door but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. Mikey proceeds to beat him in the head with a baseball bat. Soon after, the police have arrived to find Mikey \\"hiding\\" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family. A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey get fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family. She does not present as somebody who is overly interested in taking care of a young child. He is then sent to a new family, Neil and Rachel Trenton, who don't know anything about Mikey's past. Mikey presents himself as an amiable and loving child.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how to make curried rice","completion":"To make curried rice, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the ingredients: - 1 cup basmati rice (or any long-grain rice) - 2 cups water - 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or coconut oil) - 1 onion, finely chopped - 2 cloves garlic, minced - 1 tablespoon ginger, minced or grated - 1-2 tablespoons curry powder (based on desired spice level) - 1 teaspoon cumin - 1 teaspoon turmeric - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for added spice) - 1 cup diced vegetables (optional – carrots, peas, bell peppers, etc.) - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish) 2. Rinse the rice: - Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and helps to ensure that the rice cooks properly without becoming too sticky. 3. Cook the rice: - In a medium saucepan, bring the 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for about 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. Set aside. 4. Prepare the curry sauce: - In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. 5. Add spices and vegetables: - Stir in the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for about 1 minute, allowing the spices to toast and become fragrant. Add the diced vegetables (if using) and cook until they begin to soften, about 3-4 minutes. 6. Combine the rice and curry sauce: - Add the cooked rice to the skillet with the curry sauce and vegetables. Mix everything together until the rice is evenly coated with the sauce and the flavors are well combined. 7. Serve and garnish: - Taste and adjust salt and pepper, if needed. Transfer the curried rice to a serving dish and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve alongside your favorite main dish, such as grilled or roasted chicken, fish, or tofu. By following these steps, you will have a delicious and flavorful dish of curried rice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of Nanelia father? from the following article ? The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, has been charged with killing his wife and the woman's sister. Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising 23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted. Prosecutors have not offered any motive for the slayings. Steele's attorney, Jessa Nicholson, said during a court hearing Friday that she plans to investigate Steele's mental stability. She appeared with Steele via video conference from the Rock County jail, where Steele is being held because of his close relationship with Dane County jailers. He sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit and looked directly at the camera as Nicholson spoke. Suspect: Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andy Steele, accused of killing his wife and sister-in-law, makes an initial appearance via teleconference in Dane County Court in Madison, Wisconsin, Friday. Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. 'He wants to work within (the criminal justice) system to see this to its conclusion,' she said. According to a criminal complaint filed Friday, Tollefsbol, 38, called police August 22 from the Steele home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. She said Steele had shot her and she was dying. Police arrived and found Tollefsbol in the basement, shot in the back and covered with blood, the complaint said. She again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died at a hospital about an hour after making her call for help. A Dane County sheriff's SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, dead in the master bedroom. She had been shot in the head and had a zip-tie wrapped around her throat, cutting off circulation, the complaint said. The SWAT team found Andrew Steele in a laundry room with a handgun. The dryer was running but was vented back into the room. A portable grill was also in the room and was very hot and loaded with charcoal. An officer secured the handgun but Steele put up a fight before the team subdued him, the complaint said. Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor. No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account. Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than 20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative. Investigators had said previously that Steele suffered injuries consistent with a suicide attempt but didn't offer details beyond saying he wasn't shot. Assistant District Attorney Paul Barnett told reporters Friday that Steele was treated for smoke inhalation at a Milwaukee medical facility. The complaint does not suggest a motive, and Barnett declined to comment on the investigation. Court Commissioner Scott McAndrew set Steele's bail at 1million and ordered him to have no contact with his children or any members of his wife's family. Barnett had asked for 5million, arguing that Steele planned the slayings and would have nothing to lose if he were released and attacked other family members. Barnett also argued that Steele could use money his family raised for his medical bills on bail. Nicholson said the money has been placed in a holding account and will be transferred to a charity. She asked for 100,000 bail and that he be allowed to call the couple's two children, arguing that he doesn't have much time left to spend with them because of his disease. McAndrew said he was not comfortable with anything less than 1million. Steele's wife was spearheading a drive to raise 75,000 for his medical care; her Facebook page is full of videos of Steele's law enforcement colleagues taking ice bucket challenges on his behalf. They had raised about 23,000 when Ashlee Steele died. Steele's preliminary hearing is set for September 4. Steele was ordered held on 1million bail and barred from contacting his family. Fitchburg Police were called to the Steeles' home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1pm last Friday. According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots. Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Members of a sheriff's department SWAT team found Ashlee Steele dead in the home. She had been shot in the head. They found Andrew Steele in a laundry room and a 9 mm pistol on the counter. He had not been shot but had non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. The affidavit said two rounds had been fired in the house. The Steeles have two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband have four children. Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister. Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4. His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses. The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May. The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed. 'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said. It had got so bad, the website said, that the muscle-twitching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food. Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.' Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive. Tragic: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead on Friday, leaving six children behind between them. Young love: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment. Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.' The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael. Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.' According to the sisters' obituaries, Kacee Tollefsbol was studying to be a nurse and held a degree in English from the University of St. Thomas. A mother of four, she had just married Mark Tollefsbol a month before she died. Ashlee Steele, a mother of two, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and taught three-year-olds at a church preschool.

Summarize this article in one sentence. EU officials have been urging Ukraine since 2014 to clamp down on corruption and to carry out other reforms. But critics say not enough has changed, and President Petro Poroshenko has been accused of backing corrupt officials. The Brussels talks with senior EU officials will focus on the progress of reforms, with the promise of visa-free travel for Ukrainians on the table. But Ukraine hopes another matter - Russia's role on Ukrainian territory - will take priority at the meeting. Perception of corruption is worse in Ukraine than in Russia, according to Transparency International. Two weeks ago, the governor of the Odessa region, former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, resigned, accusing Mr Poroshenko of backing corrupt officials who, he said, were undermining his reform efforts in Odessa. Days earlier, officials were forced to reveal their huge wealth - hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and collections of luxury items - under new anti-corruption rules. In 2014, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power amid corruption allegations - his lavish estate, with Greek ruins and a replica galleon, was then revealed. Last month, activists hung underwear outside parliament in protest - the word for \\"underwear\\" resembles that for \\"cowards\\". Ever-since the collapse of the Soviet Union, corruption has, for many people, continued to be an integral part of everyday life in Ukraine. Ukrainians know that a small payment is often necessary if their child wants to see a good doctor. At some schools extra money can, perhaps benignly, be requested from parents for books or other equipment. A lack of funding for schools and hospitals is part of the problem. Earlier this year a journalist wrote about her shame when she paid a 200 (Â£160) bribe to her university professor, to ensure that he passed her dissertation. Since 2014, some things have changed. The police used to have the worst reputation for exacting bribes. From personal experience, police officers in Kiev nowadays religiously play by the book. Unnecessary levels of bureaucracy are often where \\"extra payments\\" creep in. And low salaries are also to blame. The minimum wage in Ukraine is currently just 56 a month, although it will be doubled in the new year. Ukraine has created a new anti-corruption bureau, a new police force, new electronic systems for tendering government contracts, and a method for tracking the wealth of public officials and politicians. On Wednesday, a 23-year-old lawyer, Anna Kalynchuk, was appointed to lead the anti-corruption drive. Critics claim she lacks the proper experience, but others have welcomed new ideas to challenge older politicians. Days earlier, 24-year-old Anastasia Deyeva was appointed deputy interior minister one of the country's highest-ranking police and security positions. The seizure of territory by pro-Russian rebels in Donbass in south-eastern Ukraine remains a concern for the Kiev government, more than two years after the annexation of Crimea by Russia. \\"I think the focus must be on the situation in Donbass, on Russian aggression, on the extension of sanctions,\\" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said before the summit. He said Russia must be forced to honour peace agreements signed in early 2015. Ukraine is also concerned about Donald Trump's praise of the Russian president during the US presidential campaign. Mr Trump repeatedly talked about repairing relations with Russia, and criticised the United States' role in Ukraine. His comments led some Ukrainians to fear a withdrawal of US support, or even the acceptance of the new status quo in Crimea by Mr Trump's White House. Summary:","completion":"Ukraine is focusing on fighting corruption with the appointment of a 23-year-old lawyer to lead its anti-corruption drive, as the country faces criticism for not doing enough to tackle the problem and risking the terms of its 17.5bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) lifeline if it doesn't succeed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A more appropriate answer to the question \\"How Do You Get Hepatitis C?\\" would be: Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and primarily affects the liver. It is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. The common ways of getting infected with Hepatitis C are: 1. Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment with an infected person. 2. Receiving a blood transfusion, organ transplant, or blood products before 1992 in the United States, when widespread HCV screening was implemented. In some countries without proper blood screening standards, this risk still exists. 3. Accidental needlestick injuries, especially among healthcare workers. 4. Sharing personal care items like razors, toothbrushes, or nail clippers that may have come into contact with an infected person's blood. 5. Unsterile tattoo or body piercing equipment. 6. Mother-to-child transmission during birth, although this happens less frequently. It is important to note that Hepatitis C is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, shaking hands, or sharing eating utensils. In addition, it is not transmitted through airborne particles like coughing or sneezing. Staying informed and taking preventive measures are crucial for reducing the risk of contracting Hepatitis C."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Eric asked Dennis to take care of their cat as","completion":"Eric was going away on a business trip for a week. Dennis, being a good friend and a cat lover himself, immediately agreed to help Eric out. Before Eric left for his trip, he provided Dennis with all the necessary details and instructions to ensure the cat's comfort and well-being during his absence. First and foremost, he reminded Dennis that their cat, affectionately named Whiskers, was diabetic and required daily insulin injections. To further guide Dennis in this important task, Eric showed him the prescribed dosage and how to administer the injections using a special insulin pen. Alongside this, there was a carefully prepared timetable so that the injections would be given at consistent times each day. This would allow Whiskers' body to maintain a stable blood sugar level, ensuring her health did not suffer. Moreover, Eric explained the specifics of Whiskers' diet. He brought out various cans of specialty cat food, specifically designed for diabetic cats, and went into detail about how much and when to feed her. It was essential to keep her diet consistent and avoid giving her any treats not approved by her veterinarian. To help Dennis in this aspect, Eric had organized everything in a practical and efficient manner. He had labeled the food with times and dates to prevent any confusion or deviation from Whiskers' regular feeding habits. Next up was Whiskers' quirky behavior. Eric mentioned that she had a shy personality, quickly becoming nervous in unfamiliar situations. Dennis was advised to approach her calmly and gently so that she could grow accustomed to his presence. Eric also pointed out Whiskers' favorite toys and hiding spots so that Dennis could engage with her constructively, helping her overcome her anxiety and fear. In addition, Eric stressed the necessity of maintaining Whiskers' hygiene. He explained that she had a strict routine of being groomed every second day with a gentle brush and could become distressed if this didn't happen. He handed Dennis a grooming kit, which consisted of a soft brush, a flea comb, and nail clippers for Whiskers' claws. Eric took the time to demonstrate the proper techniques for using these tools, ensuring that Dennis felt comfortable taking care of Whiskers' grooming needs. As the discussion progressed, Eric highlighted that Whiskers had a sensitive stomach, and therefore, it was important to keep her litter box clean. He recommended cleaning it at least twice a day to avoid any unpleasant surprises. In order to avoid triggering Whiskers' sensitivity, Eric had stocked up on litter that was specifically designed for cats with sensitive stomachs. Lastly, Eric provided Dennis with the contact details of Whiskers' veterinarian and instructed him to call immediately in case of any emergency. He left a generous budget for Dennis to use in case any unexpected expenses occurred while he was away. Dennis assured Eric that he would care for Whiskers as if she were his own, adhering to all the detailed instructions and offering her the best possible care during Eric's absence. With a heavy heart, Eric left for his business trip, knowing that Whiskers was in good hands. Meanwhile, Dennis, now equipped with a greater understanding and appreciation of Whiskers' special needs, was eager to provide the loving and attentive care that she required. Over the course of the week, Dennis and Whiskers started to bond, as the shy feline learned to trust her new caretaker. They shared playtime, cuddles, and companionship, ensuring that Whiskers continued to thrive during Eric's absence. When Eric returned, he was relieved to find Whiskers content, healthy, and well-cared for, and offered his deepest gratitude to Dennis for being such a steadfast and attentive friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(quotation marks and citation omitted).","completion":"Task Explanation: In this task, you are presented with a sentence, and your role is to determine if it is overruling or non-overruling. An overruling sentence is one that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent due to a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court that establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Step 1: Read the sentence \\"in re h.b.c., 482 s.w.3d 696, 702 (tex. app.texarkana 2016, no pet.) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\" Step 2: Determine if the sentence is overruling or non-overruling based on the definition. Solution: In this sentence, we see information about a case \\"in re h.b.c., 482 s.w.3d 696, 702 (tex. app.texarkana 2016, no pet.) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\" However, there is no information suggesting that a previous case decision was nullified, nor information about a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court establishing a different rule on the point of law involved. Therefore, this sentence would be classified as non-overruling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The inquiry, or question, we are talking about only focuses on one situation. Some people say this question is not enough to test if something is true in general. However, this one question can still help us come up with new ideas or guesses. So, can we say that \\"The inquiry is enough to provide a basis for testing general ideas?\\" - The answer is no, not directly.

How to calculate the expected value of sample information (evsi )<br>Calculate the expected monetary value (emv) of each alternative action. Note which is the emv * (greatest value). Determine the likelihood probabilities. Can we draw the following conclusion? The evsi will never equal the emv * pick from the following. i. Yes ii. It's impossible to say iii. No","completion":"To address this question, let's think step-by-step through the process of calculating EVSI and EMV*, and then evaluate the statement provided. Step 1: Calculate the EMV of each alternative action. The Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of an alternative action represents an anticipated value for an investment, calculated as the potential benefits of each outcome multiplied by their respective probabilities of occurrence. The highest EMV is denoted as EMV*. Step 2: Determine likelihood probabilities. This involves determining the probabilities of possible outcomes. These probabilities are essential for calculating EMV and EVSI. Step 3: Calculate the Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI). EVSI represents the potential improvement in decision-making provided by the collection of additional information, such as a survey or detailed research. It is the difference between the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and the Expected Opportunity Loss (EOL) without the new information. Now, let's evaluate the statement: \\"The EVSI will never equal the EMV*.\\" Based on the definitions and calculations of EVSI and EMV*, we can conclude that: iii. No The statement is incorrect because EVSI and EMV* are different concepts. EMV* represents the highest anticipated value for an investment based on current probabilities, while EVSI measures the value of acquiring additional information, which may potentially improve decision-making. It's not accurate to compare these two values directly, as they serve different purposes in the decision-making process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - michigan - united states - sky - china - apiary Explain why a human would choose \\"michigan\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"Michigan\\" as the answer to the question above because it is the option that makes the most sense given the context of the question and the provided options. Let us examine each option and understand why \\"Michigan\\" stands out as the most appropriate response. 1. Michigan: Michigan is a state located in the northern part of the United States. The climate here is characterized by cold and snowy winters. Bees, being cold-blooded insects, slow down and become inactive when the temperature drops. Hence, beekeepers may need to ship their bee colonies to warmer regions during winter to ensure the survival and health of the colony. Michigan, therefore, is a logical answer in this context. 2. United States: United States is a vast country spanning across multiple climate zones, from cold regions in the north to warm regions in the south. The question specifically asks for the original location of the bee before it was shipped down south within the United States. Selecting \\"United States\\" as the answer would be too general and doesn't provide the specific information that the question is asking for. 3. Sky: The sky is not a geographical location where bees typically reside. Bees live in colonies within hives, which are usually found on or near the ground among plant life. The sky, therefore, is not a reasonable answer for the question above. 4. China: China is a separate country in Asia, unrelated to the context of the question. The question implies that the bee had to be shipped to a warm region to avoid cold weather. It's highly unlikely that a bee will be transported from China to the United States due to legal, logistical, and environmental constraints. Thus, choosing China as the answer would not make sense. 5. Apiary: An apiary is a place where bees are kept, usually consisting of multiple beehives and managed by beekeepers. However, the term \\"apiary\\" does not indicate a specific geographical location. Therefore, choosing \\"apiary\\" as the answer does not provide the necessary information to determine where the bee was originally from. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"Michigan\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that provides a specific, logical, and relevant geographical location before shipping the bee down south to avoid the cold winter. Michigan's cold and snowy winter climate corresponds with the information provided in the question, and thus, it is the best choice among the given options."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Given the following passage \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How was Euthydemus threatened?

The extensive database of Pathfinder content is constantly at my fingertips, making character creation and rule referencing significantly easier. The app features a clean and well-organized interface that makes navigating through the plethora of rules, feats, spells, and other content a breeze. The search function is quite efficient, handling my queries with precision, and the ability to bookmark favorite pages makes returning to frequently needed rules a cinch. However, there are a few minor issues that keep this app from reaching a solid 5-star rating. Firstly, the app occasionally crashes, causing minor inconveniences during intense gaming sessions. Secondly, while the database is extensive, there are some gaps in the content, particularly when it comes to third-party material. Lastly, the app sometimes consumes more battery life than expected, which can be a concern during longer gaming sessions. Despite these issues, the org.evilsoft.pathfinder.reference app has proven to be a valuable resource for both casual and experienced Pathfinder players alike. Its convenience and ease of use make it a go-to resource for anyone looking to streamline their gaming experience.

It implies that there's a need for a broader perspective, but it does not specify what this \\"more\\" should entail. 2) \\"There must be more on the horizon than simply winning a war against terrorism, namely, a \\"promise of a better and fairer world.\\" This sentence similarly posits that the objective should go beyond merely winning the war against terrorism. However, it explicitly defines what this additional element should be - the promise of a better and fairer world. This second sentence provides a clearer articulation of what the author considers relevant in moving forward beyond the fight against terrorism. In conclusion, while both sentences emphasize the necessity of having goals beyond combating terrorism, they differ in that the first sentence does not specify what this additional component should be, while the second specifies the goal of a better and fairer world.

Premise: \\"Yes it is the only way. Then aloud he said abruptly: \\"You are an American?\\"\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, \\"You are an American?\\" very suddenly. \\"?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"Yes it is the only way. Then aloud he said abruptly: 'You are an American?'\\" we can draw certain conclusions and implications about the situation. In order to examine whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly,\\" let's analyze the text and context provided. Firstly, the premise provides a dialogue-driven narrative that is descriptive in nature. We understand that a speaker is talking, and they express their thoughts in multiple sentence fragments. The first part of the premise, \\"Yes, it is the only way,\\" implies that the speaker is in agreement with a previously discussed idea or plan. This might signify that the speaker is talking to another person, engaging in a conversation where they are exploring options or trying to reach a consensus on a particular topic. Following this, the second part of the premise states, \\"Then aloud he said abruptly: 'You are an American?'\\" This statement appears to be a direct quote from the speaker, emphasizing the method and tone employed in the dialogue. By describing the speaker as saying it \\"abruptly,\\" we can infer that the question was asked suddenly, with little to no transition from the previous statement. This abruptness likely caught the listener off-guard, perhaps sparking a reaction or an element of surprise. It also suggests that the speaker's curiosity or realization about the nationality of the listener was so pressing that they felt compelled to ask immediately, disregarding conversational norms or social expectations. With the analysis in mind, we can now address how the premise relates to the hypothesis, \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly.\\" The premise provides a direct description of the events occurring within the narrative, explicitly stating that the speaker asked the question \\"abruptly.\\" The term \\"abruptly\\" is synonymous with \\"suddenly,\\" both describing an action or event happening unexpectedly and quickly. As a result, the premise does entail the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly.\\" The narrative provided in the premise emphasizes the abrupt nature of the question, making it clear that the speaker introduced the inquiry without any prior warning or gradual build-up. This unexpected and sudden execution could potentially serve a variety of purposes within the context of the narrative, such as creating tension, showcasing the speaker's curiosity about the listener's nationality, or emphasizing the importance of the question in relation to the ongoing conversation."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: What musical instrument did Jan Thomas play for church services?

Can we draw the following conclusion? The United States economy was primarily responsible for the creation of the Swan diagram Choose your answer from: (a). Yes. (b). It's impossible to say. (c). No.","completion":"(c). No. The United States economy was not primarily responsible for the creation of the Swan Diagram. The Swan Diagram, as mentioned earlier, was developed by Australian economist Trevor Swan in 1956 to model the Australian economy during the Great Depression. Although the United States and other international economies had an impact on the Australian economy during that time, the Swan Diagram was specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by Australia. The Swan Diagram is used to illustrate the balance of payments situation of a country, demonstrating the relationship between domestic economic policies and external economic factors, such as global trade and capital flows, as well as exchange rate policies. While the United States and the global economy might have presented challenges or opportunities to the Australian economy during the Great Depression era, it would be inaccurate to attribute the creation of the Swan Diagram primarily to the United States economy. The development of the Swan Diagram was mainly driven by the need to understand the effects of Australia's policy responses to the Great Depression and the essential relationships between domestic and international economic factors. These policy responses were unique to Australia's economic environment and institutional setting, and the Swan Diagram was an important tool in studying the policy interactions between the domestic and external factors. In summary, the creation of the Swan Diagram can be attributed to Trevor Swan's efforts to understand and model the unique challenges faced by the Australian economy during the Great Depression, rather than being primarily due to any direct influence from the United States economy. The framework has since been used to analyze the balance of payments situation of other countries as well, highlighting its versatility and relevance to various economic contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brooke, a liberal Republican who became the first black in U.S. history to win popular election to the Senate, died Saturday. He was 95. Brooke died of natural causes at his Coral Gables, Florida, home, said Ralph Neas, a former Brooke aide. Brooke was surrounded by his family. Brooke was elected to the Senate in 1966, becoming the first black to sit in that branch from any state since Reconstruction and one of nine blacks who have ever served there — including Barack Obama. Brooke told The Associated Press he was \\"thankful to God\\" that he lived to see Obama's election. And the president was on hand in October 2009 when Brooke was presented with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. Obama hailed Brooke as \\"a man who's spent his life breaking barriers and bridging divides across this country.\\" A Republican in a largely Democratic state, Brooke was one of Massachusetts' most popular political figures during most of his 12 years in the Senate. Brooke earned his reputation as a Senate liberal in part by becoming the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Richard Nixon to resign. He told ABC News that Nixon had \\"lost the confidence of the country and I don't know of anything he could do to turn it around.\\" He helped lead the forces in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and was a defender of school busing to achieve racial integration, a bitterly divisive issue in Boston. He also lent his name to the Brooke amendment to the federal housing act, passed in 1969, which limited to 25 percent the amount of income a family must pay for rent in public housing. However, late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention. Repercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas. In a Boston Globe interview in 2000, he recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term. \\"It was just a divorce case. It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime,\\" Brooke said. \\"I would certainly not be truthful if I didn't say I was sorely hurt when the people of Massachusetts voted against me and didn't look beyond the allegations and didn't remember what I had tried to do for them.\\" In 2008, Barbara Walters said she had an affair with the then-married Brooke in the 1970s, but it ended before he lost the 1978 election.

Mississippi's postwar legislators sent two blacks to the Senate. Hiram R. Revels served about 14 months in 1870-71, and Blanche K. Bruce served a full six-year term from 1875 to 81. Not long before Obama was sworn in as president, Brooke told the AP that he had been frequently asked if he thought Obama could be elected. \\"And I'd say I'm the last person to say it couldn't happen. I've already shown that white voters are open to voting for black candidates, so it made sense to me,\\" he said. \\"Though I was pleased, I'm not that surprised that he was able to pull it off. But I am thankful to God to live to see this happen.\\" When Brooke received the congressional honor in Washington later in the year, he cited the issues facing Congress — health care, the economy and the wars overseas — and called on lawmakers to put their partisan differences aside. \\"We've got to get together,\\" Brooke said, turning his eyes to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \\"We have no alternative.

Kennedy. Brooke had parlayed his probes of local corruption into a successful run for state attorney general in 1962 when he became the highest ranking black elected official in the nation. Brooke said at the time that his election proved \\"people will elect a man on the basis of his programs.\\" But, he added, \\"I don't presume that the election of one man will solve the racial problem.\\" He won re-election as attorney general in 1964 even though Democrats dominated other races, commenting later: \\"I won by 797,510 votes.

After Obama’s presidential election in 2008, Brooke told The Associated Press he was ‘‘thankful to God’’ that he had lived to witness the historic accomplishment. But it was the president who remembered Brooke with praise Saturday. ‘‘Senator Brooke led an extraordinary life of public service,’’ Obama said in a statement. ‘‘As the first African-American elected as a state’s Attorney General and first African-American U.S. Senator elected after reconstruction, Ed Brooke stood at the forefront of the battle for civil rights and economic fairness.’’ A Republican in a largely Democratic state, Brooke was one of Massachusetts’ most popular political figures during most of his 12 years in the Senate. Brooke earned his reputation as a Senate liberal partly by becoming the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Richard Nixon to resign. He helped lead the forces in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and was a defender of school busing to achieve racial integration, a bitterly divisive issue in Boston.

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday described Brooke as ‘‘a model of courage and honesty in office.’’ Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the state’s first black governor, said: ‘‘I have lost a friend and mentor.’’ Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, said Brooke showed ‘‘remarkable political courage.’’ Late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention. Repercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas. Tsongas’ widow, U.S. Rep. Nikki Tsongas, said Saturday that Brooke’s career was ‘‘as courageous as it was historic.’’ In a Boston Globe interview in 2000, Brooke recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term. ‘‘It was just a divorce case.

He served in an all-black combat unit in World War II, and later settled in Boston after graduating from Boston University Law School. Brooke was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 and went public the following year, saying he wanted to encourage men to perform self-examinations and advocating that insurance companies cover male mammograms.

Brooke, the first African American to be popularly elected to the United States Senate, passed away on January 3, 2015, at the age of 95. Born in Washington D.C. in 1919, Brooke served as a Republican Senator from Massachusetts between 1967 and 1979. Brooke was a staunch advocate for civil rights, fair housing, and social justice, and became the first Republican senator to publicly call for President Richard Nixon's resignation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen","completion":"The given sentence, \\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen,\\" is a complex sentence that might initially appear to be ungrammatical or semantically incorrect. However, upon closer inspection, it can be considered syntactically and semantically acceptable, although it may not be the most conventional way to convey the intended meaning. First, let's analyze the structure of the sentence. A cleft construction has been used in the sentence to emphasize the information given at the end (i.e., \\"in the kitchen\\"). A cleft sentence is a way of reorganizing information in a sentence to add emphasis on a certain element, typically using a form of the verb \\"to be\\" as the main verb. An alternative way to express the sentence without resorting to a cleft construction would be: \\"Alison and David soaked their feet in the kitchen.\\" Second, with respect to syntactic acceptability, the sentence satisfies the basic grammar rules of English. It has a subject (\\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet\\"), verb (\\"was\\"), and object (\\"in the kitchen\\"). Additionally, the cleft construction is not incorrect in this context; it simply places a stronger focus on the location (\\"in the kitchen\\") by isolating it as the main focus. Regarding semantic acceptability, the meaning of the sentence might not be immediately clear due to the unusual phrasing, but the ideas are still connected logically. The sentence implies that the location where Alison and David engaged in the action (soaking their feet) was the kitchen. It is expressing a rather unusual activity taking place in a typical household setting, but it does not create a paradox or defy logic. Thus, although the sentence \\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen\\" may be perceived as stylistically awkward or less preferable in terms of phrasing, it is still syntactically and semantically acceptable. It conveys the intended meaning and complies with grammatical rules, but it could potentially be rewritten in a more conventional way to enhance clarity and readability for the reader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. A:","completion":"People living in inland areas are more at risk of mental retardation due to a lack of iodine in their diet. In coastal areas, people naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil and water contain higher levels of iodine, which is then absorbed by plants and sea creatures such as seaweed and saltwater fish. When people consume these iodine-rich foods, they have a decreased risk of developing iodine deficiency-related health issues, including mental retardation. Conversely, in inland areas, the soil often lacks the necessary iodine content, thus limiting the iodine available in locally grown crops and making it more difficult for the inland population to obtain enough iodine naturally. This lack of iodine in the diet increases the risk of developmental difficulties, thyroid gland problems, and even mental retardation. The introduction of iodized salt greatly improved the availability of iodide in the diet, thus reducing the risk of these health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the provided information: The user presents three notable credits of Alan Metter, which include directing \\"Back to School,\\" \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\\" and producing and directing \\"The Winds of Whoopie.\\" 2. Consider the films' popularity and reception: \\"Back to School\\" is a popular comedy film, and \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" has a cult following. However, this information alone is not enough. We need to examine the critical and audience reception of these works. 3. Research the films' critical and audience reception: A quick search reveals that \\"Back to School\\" has a 6.7/10 rating on IMDb and a 85% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, while \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" has a 6.0/10 rating on IMDb and a 62% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. \\"The Winds of Whoopie\\" doesn't have enough reviews to provide a clear rating on popular review websites. 4. Compare to other directors: To determine if Alan Metter is a great movie director, we may want to compare his work and the reception of his films with other directors considered great. 5. Subjectivity in greatness: It is important to note that the term \\"great\\" is subjective, and people's opinions on what makes a director great may vary. Factors that could influence one's opinion include personal taste in film genres, directing style, impact on the industry, and consistent track record of producing high-quality films.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit.

Options: - breathe - experience sadness - forget nothing - remember everything - to get food The answer is \\"remember everything\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"remember everything\\" because elephants are known for their exceptional memory and cognitive abilities. This characteristic is often referred to with the expression \\"elephants never forget.\\" The situation presented in the question involves an elephant being asked to recall a previously mentioned number, and the context implies an examination or demonstration of the elephant's memory capabilities. There are a few reasons why an elephant's memory is vital to its survival and success. In the wild, these animals typically live in complex social structures where recognizing, understanding, and remembering relationships among their group members is essential. Additionally, elephants have to remember the locations of scarce resources such as water and food sources during difficult times, like droughts, and pass on this knowledge to their offsprings, aiding the survival of the entire group. Furthermore, elephants are known to grieve their dead and exhibit strong emotions such as sadness and joy, which play an important role in their social bonds. The ability to experience these emotions and remember them helps elephants understand their place in the group and grow socially, emotionally, and cognitively. However, the experience of sadness itself would not necessarily be the reason why an elephant would be asked to recall a number; this would be much more closely linked to showcasing their memory skills. The phrase \\"forget nothing\\" is similar to \\"remember everything\\" but may imply a more passive memory retention, whereas \\"remember everything\\" emphasizes the active cognitive ability to recall specific pieces of information or memories with precision and intent. In the context of the question, the answer \\"remember everything\\" implies that the elephant was asked to remember a number because it is a deliberate demonstration of its mental capabilities. The other options provided, such as \\"breathe\\" and \\"to get food,\\" are not directly related to the elephant's cognitive abilities. Breathing is a basic physiological function that all living creatures perform, and while elephants may use their memories to help them locate food resources, remembering a specific number is not a requirement to achieve this goal. As a result, they do not pertain to the main reason of the elephant being asked to recall the number. In conclusion, the answer is \\"remember everything\\" because the elephant's exceptional memory is being tested and demonstrated by challenging it to remember a specific number previously mentioned.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Question: Given the background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. and the situation: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. Answer the following question: If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural? Answer:","completion":"Based on Rob's interests and the given background information about valley glaciers and joint blocks, it would be more suitable for Rob to visit the Ural Mountains in Russia next year if he is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers. In the Alps Mountains in Austria, Rob witnessed valley glaciers, which are responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, including large joint blocks. This implies that if he revisits the Alps, he may likely encounter joint blocks within the valley glaciers again, since this is a prevalent glacial phenomenon in such an environment. On the other hand, when Rob went to the Ural Mountains in Russia, he did not see any valley glaciers. This suggests that the glacial environment in the Ural Mountains is not characterized by valley glaciers and, consequently, the presence of joint blocks in the glaciers would be less likely. Therefore, revisiting the Ural Mountains could be a more suitable option for Rob if he wishes to avoid seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers. In summary, if Rob's goal for next year is to avoid seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers during his travel, he should choose to visit the Ural Mountains in Russia rather than the Alps in Austria, as this region seems to have a lower likelihood of featuring valley glaciers and the associated joint blocks."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

For the third successive season they were handed a ‘Group of Death’. There’s no sugar-coating it — Group E is gruesome, brutal, grim. If Pellegrini was to pick one scenario he didn’t want ahead of the draw, this wouldn’t have been far off. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City: Vincent Kompany wants the quadruple. Deja vu: Manchester City and Bayern Munich will meet in the group stages for the third time in three years. Possible: James Milner celebrates the third goal when the sides last met, in a 3-2 win for City. His mood will not have been helped by knowing that, down in London, Jose Mourinho had his feet up, with Chelsea surely as good as in the knockout stages after being given a relatively easy ride. For the second successive season, City will face Bayern Munich; the Bundesliga giants wounded by last season’s failed attempt to retain their title. Riding on the crest of Germany’s World Cup win, Pep Guardiola’s side will be one of the toughest teams to beat this season. City’s nightmare does not end there, though. Two clashes against a rejuvenated Roma will provide a huge test of their European credentials. In an uncanny twist, Roma and City crossing paths throws open the possibility of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole going head-to-head for the first time since they left Chelsea this summer. Pellegrini will know the fixtures against Roma and CSKA Moscow are paramount to City making it to the last 16. Quick return: The draw gives Ashley Cole a first chance to return to England when Roma meet City. Tricky tie: Roma are a much better side than in previous years, led by a resurgent Gervinho. And if he thought things could not get much worse, he only needs to look at a daunting eight-day stretch next month when he must squeeze a trip to Bavaria between crucial League clashes at Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. ‘It’s a tough one,’ said City’s sporting director Txiki Beguiristan. ‘Our challenge is to be first in the group because that gives you an advantage. ‘The objective is higher now. That’s why we improved the team, to give us a chance of winning the domestic competitions but also to be better in Europe. There are five, six, eight other clubs that can win it but we can as well. Why should we not set out to win the Champions League?’ Thursday’s draw would also not have made comfortable viewing for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Perhaps not quite to the same extent as Pellegrini, but Wenger will yet again have to pit his wits against one of Europe’s most impressive young coaches in Jurgen Klopp. Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season. Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year. But facing Borussia Dortmund, 2013’s beaten finalists, will not paralyse Wenger’s expensively-assembled squad with fear. After losing to the Bundesliga side on matchday three last season, the Gunners went to Dortmund and recorded a famous 1-0 win against the odds, Aaron Ramsey scoring. Arsenal secretary David Miles said: ‘It’s tough but it’s one from which there’s a pre-requisite to finish first and avoid the likes of Barcelona at the start of the knock-out stage.’ Anderlecht and Galatasaray are likely provide a more modest test. While Liverpool ponder the challenge of Real Madrid, Basle and the Bulgarians of Ludogorets, Mourinho must have had by far the best night’s sleep. Special one: Jose Mourinho will be very please with Chelsea's comfortable Champions League draw. When he holds his weekly press conference at Chelsea’s Cobham HQ on Friday, the Portuguese will inevitably dispel the notion that his side have been handed an easy European ride. But the Special One himself could not have handpicked a more comfortable group. With all due respect, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Maribor hardly reads as a who’s who of European football’s elite. Much to Brendan Rodgers, Pellegrini and Wenger’s annoyance, no doubt. VIDEO Three European giants drawn in Group F.

Generations of children have cherished memories of receiving handmade toys gifted by a mysterious and revered toy maker, who always remained out of sight. As excitement fills the town each year, a secret alliance lies between the town's Mayor, Theodore Bannister, and the Chief of Police, Katarina Chambers. The movie begins with the toy festival's preparations in full swing. The protagonist, Emma, a determined investigative journalist from the city, arrives in Whistlewood to write a piece about the festival. As Emma delves deeper, she stumbles upon undisclosed information about the identity of the toy maker and starts unraveling a web of secrets. The town is delightfully decorated, with Whistlewood's citizens rallying together for the much-anticipated toy festival. Emma explores the town, meeting local residents and uncovering stories of gifts given to children by the elusive toy maker. The mayor and the chief of police are seen to be taking a keen interest in the toy festival preparations, ensuring everything remains perfect and smooth. One day, Emma comes across a hidden workshop in the woods. Curiosity piqued, she manages to sneak in and discovers a treasure trove of exquisite, handmade toys. She is caught by an old man, Oscar, who is grumpy but harmless. Oscar reveals that he was once the town's beloved toy maker, but that changed years ago when Mayor Bannister and Chief of Police Chambers hatched a plan to drive him out of Whistlewood to make way for corporate toy manufacturing and to garner funds for their personal benefits. The mayor and chief of police framed Oscar for a crime he didn't commit and made a pact to keep his role as the toymaker a secret, shrouded in mystery. Since then, they've been profiting by selling the toys at exorbitant prices and exploiting the people's belief in the mysterious toy maker. Emma, now fueled by the desire for justice, sets out to expose Mayor Bannister and Chief Chambers' deception. With the unwilling help of Oscar and the support of the townspeople, she devises a plan to unmask the mayor and police chief's hidden agenda. During the grand finale of the toy festival, just as Mayor Bannister and the Chief of Police are basking in the limelight, Emma presents undeniable evidence of what has been happening, exposing them in front of everyone. The townspeople, enraged at the betrayal, demand for Theodore and Katarina's immediate resignation. The movie ends with the town celebrating a joyous, honest toy festival - with Oscar reclaiming his status as the true toy maker of Whistlewood. Emma writes a compelling article on the events that transpired, cementing her belief in the power of truth and justice."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Urban sprawl or suburban sprawl describes the expansion of human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional and usually car-dependent communities, in a process called suburbanization. In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In Continental Europe the term \\"peri-urbanisation\\" is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth. - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority.

Title: How to Make a Monster Movie plot: When a test group says the company's latest video game, Evilution, is too boring, the game's development team is fired. Businessman Peter Drummond hires three new programmers: A weapons expert named Hardcore, a game artificial intelligence designer named Sol, and a sound effects creator named Bug. Faye Clayton promises 1 million to the programmer who makes the game the \\"scariest\\", igniting a fierce rivalry between the trio. During a storm three weeks later, lightning strikes the building and causes all of the computers and electronic equipment to go offline. After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the final boss. Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body. The suit attacks Hardcore; although he initially manages to fight it off, he is later killed. The suit then merges itself with Hardcore's muscular body and takes all of his weapons, giving it a striking resemblance to the monster in the game. Bug theorizes that the lighting strike combined with Sol's powerful AI chip has caused the suit to believe the real world is part of the video game.

You are given a new situation: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less. and a hint : A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What league will be bringing an expansion team in 2021 to the city that once housed the Seattle Supersonics?, using the article: Seattle was awarded a Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969. The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001. The NBA All-Star Game was also held in Seattle twice: the first in 1974 at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in 1987 at the Kingdome.Seattle also boasts two collegiate sports teams based at the University of Washington and Seattle University, both competing in NCAA Division I for various sports. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the Huskies, competes in the Pac-12 Conference, and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the Redhawks, mostly competes in the Western Athletic Conference. The Huskies teams use several facilities, including the 70,000-seat Husky Stadium for football and the Hec Edmundson Pavilion for basketball and..., what would be the answer ?

Translate this to English?","completion":"Moreover, what makes it even worse is that this reality was also based on the distortion of the claim to autonomy of labor, as articulated by the radical left in Italy during the 1970s. In this statement, the author seems to be critiquing a particular aspect of socio-political and economic development. The author references the radical left in Italy from the 1970s as a key driver or contributor to this issue. Specifically, they highlight the distortion of the \\"claim to autonomy of labor,\\" implying that this distortion has led to negative consequences in society. To provide a broader context on this issue, let's delve into the political and social climate of Italy in the 1970s. During this period, Italy experienced a turbulent time marked by economic struggles, political tensions, and social unrest. The radical left, an array of socialist and communist factions, strongly believed in the empowerment of the working class. Among their beliefs was the need for greater autonomy in labor in order to challenge the power structures that dominated society at the time. It can be understood that the author sees the distortion of this \\"claim to autonomy\\" as being problematic, perhaps because the original intent might have become lost or misrepresented over time. It's possible that the shift from genuinely seeking to empower workers to a more general sense of entitlement or individualism may have been perceived as a problematic change. Moreover, this distortion may have contributed to various societal issues that the author is criticizing. In conclusion, this statement critiques the historical distortion of the radical left's claim to autonomy of labor in Italy during the 1970s. The author suggests that this distortion has led to negative socio-political and economic consequences, making it even worse for the society at large. Understanding the political and social context of the time can help in grasping the deeper concerns brought forth by the author."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. John Stevens. They are supposed to be a man’s best friend. But it seems a new generation of dogs are not so well behaved. A third of dog owners have being bitten or attacked by a dog, it has been revealed. The rise of the unruly dogs has been blamed on a lack of discipline when they were puppies when their owners could not be bothered to have them trained properly. Snarl: A third of dog owners have been bitten, according to new research. File picture. The leading veterinary charity the PDSA has warned that millions of dogs are more aggressive due to gaps in their pet knowledge. A study of pet owners by the charity found that around 5.3million dogs (some 61 per cent) never attended training classes within the first six months of life. It said 1.3 million dogs across the UK are now displaying behavioural problems. The 2012 PDSA Animal Welfare Report found that a fifth of dog owners in the East of England reported that their dogs show problem behaviour on a regular basis. This was closely followed by the North East (19 per cent) and Yorkshire and Humber (19 per cent). Undisciplined: A lack of or poor training is behind the alarming figure, according to the PDSA. File picture. The area of the UK with the least reported problem behaviour in dogs was Wales (8 per cent). The research revealed that almost one in three (30 per cent) dog owners have been bitten or attacked by a dog with over half (51 per cent) knowing someone else who has. While in some cases dogs are deliberately trained to be aggressive, the report found that the primary cause of the anti-social behaviour is a lack of socialisation and basic obedience training when dogs are young .David Ryan, Clinical Animal Behaviourist and former Chair of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors said: ‘Good puppy socialisation and training classes undoubtedly help to reduce the initial development of aggression, but it is also essential to provide our pets with guidance in good behaviour, at home and elsewhere, throughout their lives. 'Training should be synonymous with ‘living with’ and never stops.’ PDSA Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Sean Wensley, said: ‘Each year there are awful stories of dogs attacking pets and people, sometimes with fatal consequences. ‘Tackling this begins with owners and breeders taking full responsibility for their dogs’ behaviour and adequately socialising and training them from a young age. ‘It is also essential that young people understand how to be safe around all pets and learn how to become caring and responsible owners in the future. ‘In PDSA’s view, this should include learning about a pet’s five welfare needs at school as well as from other responsible adults around them.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article says that many dogs are behaving badly and attacking people.

Do you know who Edward Snowden is? He is a man who used to work for the United States government, at a place called the National Security Agency (NSA). He shared some secret information about what the government was doing, and now he lives in a country called Russia because he's afraid of what might happen to him if he goes back home. Guess what? Edward Snowden just talked to some people from a TV channel in Germany, which is another country in Europe. He told them that some people from the US government have said that they want to hurt him. He even thinks that they might want to shoot him or make him sick with poison! But do not worry too much, because he's being very careful. Right now, he's hiding in Russia, and he's not planning to go back to the United States anytime soon. One reason he doesn't want to go back is because he doesn't think he will get a fair trial in court. You see, there's a law called the Espionage Act, which makes it very hard for people like Edward Snowden to defend themselves in court. He believes that this law doesn't let him tell the judge and jury why he did what he did, which is important for them to understand his side of the story. So, for now, Edward Snowden will stay in Russia, where he feels safer from those who might want to hurt him. And we can learn from this story that sometimes, telling the truth can be very dangerous, but it's important to stand up for what we believe is right."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: When can a person's death not be wanted by the person? Options: - cyanide - love - burial - suicide - murder The answer to this question is:","completion":"murder. A person's death not being wanted by the person typically refers to a situation where the individual has not made the decision or does not have control over the circumstances leading to their death. In the options provided, murder best aligns with this concept. Murder, by definition, is the unlawful killing of another person without consent, justification, or legitimate reason. It is an act where the victim has no control over their fate, and it is generally committed with malicious intent by another individual. Therefore, murder is the option that most clearly demonstrates a situation where a person's death is unwanted by the person themselves. To further explain, let us examine the other options: 1. Cyanide: Cyanide is a highly toxic substance that can be lethal when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. While cyanide poisoning could potentially play a role in some unwanted deaths, it is just a poison and not a situation or action that directly relates to the individual's desires or intent. 2. Love: Love is an abstract concept and an emotion that can elicit strong feelings of affection, connection, and commitment between individuals. It is not directly related to causing death or any violent act in most cases, and it does not fit the context of the question. 3. Burial: Burial is a common practice for disposing of a deceased person's body, often in the form of internment underground or placement in a tomb. It is a process that takes place after a person has died and does not pertain to whether the death itself was wanted or unwanted by the person. 4. Suicide: Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life. While it is a tragic and devastating event, it is a decision ultimately made by the individual and typically arises from a state of deep mental anguish, despair, or hopelessness. In this context, the person chooses to end their own life, and their death is not forced upon them by someone else, unlike in the case of murder. Thus, suicide does not fit the criteria of a person's death being unwanted by the person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Classroom A classroom is the most suitable place where one would need to use a writing instrument, as it is designed to facilitate learning, teaching, and communication. Writing instruments, such as pens, pencils, and markers, are essential tools for students and educators in a classroom setting. They are used for various tasks, such as taking notes, completing assignments, drawing diagrams, and solving problems. In a classroom, writing instruments are indispensable for various reasons: 1. Note-taking: Students need to take notes during lectures and discussions in order to retain vital information. Writing instruments allow them to quickly and efficiently record details they will later need for studying and revision. 2. Homework and assignments: Students are often required to complete written tasks, such as essays, reports, and worksheets. Writing instruments are necessary for these activities, as they allow students to produce legible, organized, and well-presented work. 3. Examinations: Many exams require students to write down their answers using a pen or pencil. It is essential for students to be able to use writing instruments confidently and effectively so that they can express their thoughts accurately and concisely. 4. Collaboration and group work: In many classroom activities, students work together in teams to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and share knowledge. Writing instruments play a crucial role in these interactions. They allow students to record each other's input, create visual representations, and jot down key points for later reference. 5. Presentations and visual aids: Instructors and students often use visual aids to support their presentations, discussions, or explanations. Writing instruments are required to create these visual materials, such as diagrams, charts, and illustrations. 6. Learning new concepts: The process of learning often involves practicing and applying new ideas through written exercises. In this context, writing instruments help students to better understand and internalize complex information. In conclusion, a classroom is the most suitable setting to use writing instruments, such as pens, pencils, and markers. They facilitate effective communication, foster critical thinking, and enhance overall academic performance. By contrast, options A (pocket), B (purse), D (writer's hand), and E (stationary) do not represent settings or situations in which the actual use of writing instruments is required or essential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas... The answer is:","completion":"In the context of the Shoshone National Forest and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the non-native plant species that are considered noxious include: 1. Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) 2. Musk thistle (Carduus nutans) 3. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) 4. Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) 5. Yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) These non-native plants are considered noxious because they negatively impact native plant communities and the species that depend on them. They can outcompete native plants for resources, reduce biodiversity, and alter ecosystems, causing lasting damage to the environment. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle also have a significant negative impact on some tree species, as they affect the health of timberland in the forest."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Context: Tracy found Kendall's place even after Kendall said he didn't want to be bothered.

German:","completion":"Aufgrund der kleinen Produktionsmengen sind viele dieser Modelle direkt nach der Veröffentlichung ausverkauft, also beeile dich, um deins zu bekommen... Step-by-step justification: 1. \\"Because of the small production lots\\" is translated to \\"Aufgrund der kleinen Produktionsmengen\\". \\"Because of\\" is translated to \\"Aufgrund\\", and the object \\"small production lots\\" remains the same in structure, \\"kleinen Produktionsmengen\\". The adjective \\"small\\" is translated to \\"kleinen\\" and it describes \\"Produktionsmengen\\", which is a compound noun formed by \\"Produktion\\" (production) and \\"Mengen\\" (lots). 2. \\"Many of these models\\" is translated to \\"viele dieser Modelle\\". \\"Many\\" is translated to \\"viele\\", and the phrase \\"of these models\\" is translated to \\"dieser Modelle\\". 3. \\"Sell out right after release\\" is translated to \\"sind direkt nach der Veröffentlichung ausverkauft\\". \\"Sell out\\" is translated to \\"ausverkauft\\", and \\"right after\\" is translated to \\"direkt nach\\". The noun \\"release\\" is translated to \\"Veröffentlichung\\". 4. \\"So hurry up\\" is translated to \\"also beeile dich\\". \\"So\\" is translated to \\"also\\", and \\"hurry up\\" is translated to the imperative form of the verb \\"sich beeilen\\" which is \\"beeile dich\\" when referring to second person singular (informal). 5. \\"To get yours\\" is translated to \\"um deins zu bekommen\\". The infinitive construction \\"to get\\" is translated to \\"zu bekommen\\", and \\"yours\\" is translated to \\"deins\\". The phrase \\"um ... zu\\" is used to indicate a purpose or goal.

The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie.

It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting .

Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss. - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation.

Ian Buckwalter from NPR suggests that Edwards succeeds in striking a balance between \\"character and meaningful story\\" and the sheer spectacle of the movie. Buckwalter adds, \\"This is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to: never short on dazzle, but unafraid to let us catch our breath once it's been taken away.\\" Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune goes so far as to argue that the new Godzilla film is \\"the best Godzilla since the first Godzilla,\\" although he admits that this praise is not overly enthusiastic. He lauds the movie's technical achievements, but notes that it often \\"mumbles and repeats itself\\" while lacking a strong focus on human details. Overall, this latest Godzilla film is a fascinating and visually exciting addition to the longstanding franchise but may not have achieved the perfect balance between human drama and monstrous spectacle that some critics desire."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: Tim Berners-Lee is the man who wrote the software program that led to the foundation of the World Wide Web. Britain played an important part in developing the first generation of computers. The parents of Tim Berners-Lee both worked on one of the earliest commercial computers and talked about their work at home. As a child he would build models of computers from packing material. After graduating from Oxford University he went on to the real thing. In the 1980s, scientists were already communicating using a primitive version of e-mail. While working at a laboratory in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program, which let him store these messages. This gave him another idea: write a program that will let academics from across the world share information on a single place. In 1990 he wrote the HTTP and HTML programs which form the basis of the World Wide Web. The next year his programs were placed on to the Internet. Everyone was welcome to use them and improve them if they could. Programmers used this codes to work with different operating systems. New things like web browsers and search engines were developed. Between 1991 and 1994 the number of web pages rose from 10 to 100,000. In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee formed the newly formed World Wide Web consortium , or W3C. More than 200 leading companies and laboratories are represented by W3C. Together they make sure that everyone can share equally on the web. \\"The Web can help people to understand the way that others live and love.

Choices: - sweating - having fun - smiling - increased heart rate - anger The rationale to choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"sweating. Sweating is an uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope because it is a physical activity that requires exertion and energy. As you jump rope, your body works harder to keep up with the demand for oxygen and to maintain your muscles' function. This leads to an increase in your body temperature, and sweating is your body's way of cooling itself down. Let's briefly go over the other choices to clarify why they are not valid answers: - Having fun: Although some might find exercise fun, it is not an \\"uncomfortable\\" consequence. Jumping rope can be enjoyable, and engaging in an activity you enjoy can improve your overall mood. - Smiling: Smiling is generally associated with feeling happy, not being uncomfortable. Jumping rope can cause some people to smile due to the enjoyable nature of the exercise or the release of endorphins, which might bring about feelings of happiness and accomplishment. - Increased heart rate: While it is true that an increased heart rate is a consequence of jumping rope as it is a cardiovascular exercise, it is not inherently \\"uncomfortable.\\" A higher heart rate during exercise is normal, as it allows your body to increase blood circulation and deliver oxygen to your muscles efficiently. - Anger: Jumping rope is unlikely to cause anger, as this emotion is not a direct result of the physical activity itself. It is possible that external factors might lead to anger, but this is not a consequence specific to jumping rope. In conclusion, among the given choices, \\"sweating\\" is the most uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope because it is a natural but potentially bothersome response to the physical demands of the exercise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person Branca was the attorney for? is inside the article: Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, \\"Star of records, radio,..., can you guess it ?

After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \\"donkey punch\\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man. Marcus, Bluey, Kim and Lisa go to the master bedrooms where they begin having drug-fuelled sex, watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a penknife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender.

In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a flare, attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women.

Article: Wear comfortable and supportive shoes for daily activities, proper sports footwear for activities and exercise, and avoid heels over 1.5 inches (four cm) for daily use. Proper footwear is especially important during exercise because the wrong shoe can lead to injuries and sprains. Avoid wearing flip flops too often in the warmer months, as they don’t provide any support and can cause foot pain. The instruments used for manicures and pedicures can harbor and spread bacteria if they aren’t sterilized properly. Instead, practice proper foot hygiene on a daily basis and treat yourself to a weekly or semimonthly self-pedicure. If you do go for a pedicure, bring your own tools whenever possible. Never share pedicure instruments with others, especially emery boards. They are porous and cannot be sterilized properly, meaning they can trap and spread bacterial and fungi. Because diabetes can restrict circulation, it can cause health problems with the extremities, especially the hands and feet. Diabetes can cause neuropathy, or nerve damage, making it harder to detect injuries on your feet. The disease can also prevent your body from healing as quickly as it should, which increases the risk of infection. Diabetics should examine their feet every day for injuries like blisters, calluses, scaly skin patches, cracking skin, and cuts and wounds. Treat wounds immediately, and make sure your doctor looks at your feet at every visit. There are several bacterial, viral, and fungal problems that can adversely affect the health and appearance of your feet, including athlete’s foot, warts, and nail fungus. When using public swimming pools or showers (such as at hotels or gyms), wear water shoes or flip flops to protect your feet from possibly contaminated water. Symptoms of athlete’s foot include burning, itching, redness, and peeling. Warts are rough, grainy growths on the skin that may have black pinpoints scattered throughout. Nail fungus, which can enter the toenail through a crack or break, can cause nails to become brittle, thick, and discolored. Chronic foot pain is never normal, and should always be addressed with a medical practitioner. It can be a sign of plantar fasciitis, a stabbing pain and inflammation down the bottom center of the foot, which needs to be treated with therapy, orthotics, or possibly surgery. Aging, extreme cold, and joint pain can also cause foot pain, but if you frequently experience pain in your feet, talk to your doctor. There are many common medical problems that can cause foot pain and irritation, or make you embarrassed about the look of your feet. Sometimes there is nothing you can do about these conditions, but many can be treated with a little attention, orthotics, or perhaps medical attention. Some of the most common conditions involving the feet include: A bunion, which is a protruding bone that sticks out from the side of your foot where the big toe meets the foot. Bunions can cause pain, but unless the pain is severe, shoe inserts and cushions are usually favored over surgery. Hammertoes, which occur when the toes begin to bend downward at the middle joint because of out-of-balance muscles. This condition can be treated with proper footwear, foot supports, or possibly surgery. Having flat feet, when the entire sole of your foot makes contact with the ground. It is treated with strengthening exercises, arch supporting inserts, or orthotics. Calluses and corns, which are patches of thick, hard skin caused by constant pressure and rubbing. They can be trimmed or removed medically, treated with medicated pads and patches, or softened with soaking and gentle scrubbing with pumice. Gout, which is characterized by swelling, stiffness, pain, and redness of the joints in the feet, especially the big toe, as well as the ankles and knees. Gout is a form of arthritis and is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

It is not entirely clear how much legal authority Italian officials have over the Vatican Bank, since the Vatican is a sovereign state. They had the power to seize the money and stop the transactions because they took place on Italian soil, said Rossi, the prosecutor. An effort by Holocaust survivors to sue the Vatican Bank in the United States failed in 2009 when a U.S. court ruled that the Vatican Bank had \\"sovereign immunity\\" and was not subject to lawsuits filed in the United States. A lawsuit against related entities is still in court. The Vatican Bank was created by an order of the pope \\"to carry on activities that are for pious causes,\\" according to expert testimony related to the Holocaust suit. It accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006. It uses its funds \\"for designated pious purposes\\" and is \\"an autonomous pious foundation,\\" he said. Caridi, a top Italian legal scholar who was called to testify by Vatican lawyers, said the bank is an integral part of the Vatican, a \\"central entity under the oversight of the Holy See.\\" It is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state. The Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money-laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union. It must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome and Richard Allen Greene in London, England, contributed to this report.

The bank is in a special place called the Vatican, which is like a little country inside another country called Italy. Some people who work for the bank might have not followed the rules properly, so the Bank of Italy, which is like a big boss for banks in Italy, stopped the Vatican Bank from using some money for a while.

Eisenhower's GI Bill. This piece of legislation paved the way for white GIs to attend college. Despite their veteran status returning black servicemen were not afforded loans at the same rate as whites. Furthermore, at the time of its introduction, segregation was still the law of the land barring blacks from the best institutions. Overall, \\"Nearly 8 million servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the GI Bill after World War II. But for blacks, higher educational opportunities were so few that the promise of the GI Bill went largely unfulfilled.\\" Question: What opportunities were few for black veterans?","completion":"The opportunities that were few for black veterans following World War II were largely tied to higher education and home loans. The reason these opportunities were limited was due to systemic racial discrimination, segregation, and racial inequalities prevalent in the United States during the mid-20th century. Despite the GI Bill – formally known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 – aimed at supporting veterans by providing them with benefits such as educational opportunities and home loans, black veterans were not able to fully benefit from this bill. One of the main factors limiting access for black veterans was the strict segregation policies in place at the time; they barred black individuals from attending elite educational institutions which were predominantly attended by whites. The GI Bill, while having nominally equal provisions for all veterans, ended up having a disparate impact due to the racial realities of the time. Higher educational opportunities, a key element of the GI Bill, were intended to provide veterans with the chance to enrol in college, thereby transforming their lives and careers. However, for black veterans, these opportunities were few. They were systematically excluded from many higher education institutions due to segregation, which significantly limited their access to quality education. The opportunities that were available did not compare in quality or prestige to the ones that were offered to their white counterparts. In addition to barriers in education, black veterans also faced discriminatory practices in securing home loans. The GI Bill promised low-interest, zero down-payment home loans for veterans. However, lending institutions, alongside federal housing policies, systematically denied black veterans these loans or offered them under unfavorable conditions, leading to the low rate of homeownership among black populations when compared to whites. Thus, while the GI Bill opened doors for white veterans and significantly contributed to the expansion of the American middle class, for black veterans, the promise of the GI Bill for higher education and housing opportunities went largely unfulfilled. This further exacerbated the educational and socioeconomic gap between black and white Americans, having negative consequences that can be traced to modern disparities experienced by African-American communities in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Which student learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Ken learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds.

Problem:Paragraph: Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (≤10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), septal/subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (≥ 24 kg/m 2 ) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge.

Nathan, who had looked upon the men under Colonel Allen much as he had Corporal 'Lige, was literally amazed by this ready submission of the king's troops, standing silent and motionless by the side of Isaac as the garrison was paraded without arms, and the surrender made in due form. Some days afterward Isaac learned that the spoils of war at this place were one hundred and twenty iron cannon, fifty swivels, two ten-inch mortars, one howitzer, one cohorn, ten tons musket-balls, three cartloads flints, thirty gun-carriages, a quantity of shells, a large amount of material for boat building, one hundred stand of small arms, ten casks of powder, two brass cannon, thirty barrels of flour and eighteen barrels of pork. Forty-eight soldiers were surrendered and preparations were at once begun to send these, together with the women and children, to Hartford. Hardly was the surrender made complete when such of the troops as had been left on the opposite shore under Seth Warner, arrived in a schooner, much to the surprise of all, until it was learned that Captain Herrick, who had been sent to Skenesborough to seize the son of the governor, had succeeded in his mission without bloodshed. He took not only the young major, but twelve negroes and attendants, seized the schooner owned by the elder Skene, and had come down the lake in the early morning with the hope of aiding in the capture of Ticonderoga. Isaac had supposed this victory would end the adventure, and was saying to himself that his experience had been rather pleasing than otherwise, so much so in fact that he almost regretted the time was near at hand for him to return home, when he saw, much to his surprise, a portion of the troops being formed in line as if to leave Ticonderoga.

The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Premise: \\"American Movie suggests that there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"American Movie suggests that there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore,\\" the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands\\" appears to be contradictory and unlikely to be true. To further analyze this, let's delve deeper into the context, meaning, and implications of the premise and the hypothesis. The term \\"little people\\" refers to individuals who are not famous, powerful, or influential and typically lead ordinary lives within their local communities. \\"Hinterlands,\\" in this case, signifies remote or rural areas that are often thought to be detached from the modern, fast-paced urban lifestyle. These areas are generally associated with simplicity, traditional values, and a more personal sense of community. The premise suggests that American Movie, presumably a film or documentary, posits that the traditional concept of little people living in such hinterlands is fading or has already disappeared. This could mean that the film portrays their way of life as being gradually engulfed or assimilated by the globalized world, resulting in the erosion of their distinct identities and lifestyles. The factors contributing to this may include advances in technology, social media, pop culture, or economic development that have seeped into these once isolated areas. On the other hand, the hypothesis appears to challenge the premise, suggesting that American Movie portrays the existence and continued prevalence of little people in hinterlands. This implies that the film acknowledges the presence of individuals and communities that remain rooted in their traditional lifestyles and values, away from the mainstream urbanization and globalization. Given the opposing nature of the premise and the hypothesis, one cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true, unless the premise itself is false or misleading. However, without any evidence or information to challenge the validity of the premise, it would be reasonable to assume that the hypothesis is untrue based on the available information. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands\\" seems to be contradictory to the given premise and is unlikely to be true. To determine its validity, one would have to analyze the content and message of the film in question thoroughly, evaluate its portrayal of the subjects, and then gain a comprehensive understanding of the filmmaker's intent. Only then can the truthfulness of the hypothesis be accurately assessed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the mean time, Maha Nawrahta opened the southern front on 23 October 1765 in three directions. He had 20,000 to 30,000 under his command. A small army invaded by the Three Pagodas Pass towards Suphanburi. Another small army invaded down the Tenasserim coast towards Mergui and Tenasserim town. However, the main thrust of his attack was at Kanchanaburi. His 20,000-strong main southern army invaded via the Myitta Pass. Kanchanaburi fell with little resistance. The main reason for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi could be that the Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not sufficiently reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to have believed that the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi. The Siamese sources say that Maha Nawrahta's main invasion route came from southern Tenasserim, crossing the Tenasserim range at Chumphon and Phetburi. The path is totally different from the Kanchanaburi route reported by the Burmese chronicles. Historian Kyaw Thet specifically adds that the main attack route was via the Myitta Pass.

What type of thing is the question \\"When was Hurricane Hugo ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"When was Hurricane Hugo?\\" is asking about the specific time period or date during which Hurricane Hugo occurred. This question is a request for historical or chronological information. Hurricane Hugo is a specific event that took place in the past, and thus this question wants to determine its occurrence in the timeline of history. It indicates an inquiry on meteorological history, specifically within the context of significant storms or natural disasters. The question could be asking for several types of detailed information depending on the context. In its simplest form, it could be asking for the year that Hurricane Hugo happened. On a more detailed level, it might be requesting the precise dates that the hurricane started and ended. Additionally, it might be seeking information concerning the general period of the hurricane’s influence, such as the month or season within the year when it occurred. In a broader context, the question can also point toward a more complex understanding of the circumstances surrounding Hurricane Hugo. For example, if the query is raised in a conversation or a text regarding climate change, it can hint towards wanting to understand how weather patterns have shifted over time. This question might come from someone studying meteorology, history, or climate science. It can also intrigue individuals affected by the hurricane or those generally interested in significant historical events. For instance, first responders, community planners, and policy makers might wish to assess the timing of past hurricanes to prepare for future incidents. They might investigate not just when Hurricane Hugo happened, but when it hit particular locations, how long it lasted, and when recovery measures were implemented. In sum, the question \\"When was Hurricane Hugo?\\" is asking for a precise or general time frame of the occurrence of Hurricane Hugo. The answers to such an inquiry will furnish details about the hurricane's timeline and indirectly add to the understanding of major weather events or disasters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Salaries of federal employees continue to lag behind those of similar private-sector jobs by 35 percent on average, an advisory committee has said in presenting what amounts to the latest data point in a long-running debate over how the two sectors compare. The 34.92 percent “pay gap” reported Friday essentially duplicates the 35.37 and 35.28 percent numbers reported the last two years by the Federal Salary Council and is close to those of other recent years. The council, consisting of federal employee union representatives and outside compensation experts, oversees the General Schedule pay system for the 1.5 million white-collar employees below senior levels. In the so-called GS system, rates vary by locality, with separate schedules for both Alaska and Hawaii, for designated metropolitan zones, and a catchall “rest of the U.S.” for elsewhere. [Federal Diary: Push to end federal pay disparities gains strength] Within the overall average, the largest indicated pay disparities are in the areas of Washington-Baltimore, at 51 percent, and the San Francisco and San Diego, at 49 percent. The smallest is in the catchall locality, 14 percent. Rates are paid according to where employees work, not where they live. Under a 1990 law, the numbers are supposed to be used to virtually close the measured differences with private-sector pay. However, no administration or Congress since then has supported providing the funds to do that. [We have no idea how federal pay compares to the private sector. So, let’s stop acting like we do, expert says] In practice, the federal raise is worked out in the annual budget process and a locality component, when one is paid, is divided according to the local gaps. The result is that pay for a GS job in the San Francisco locality, the highest paid, exceeds the pay for one of the same grade level in the catchall locality, the lowest paid, by 18 percent. Pay tables for the new year typically are set in late December by an executive order, which this year will include 13 new city zones, while 21 of the 31 existing ones will expand. That includes the already massive Washington-Baltimore zone, which will pull in three more counties in Maryland and one more each in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Those changes will trigger a special pay boost for more than 100,000 employees who will move from the catchall area into a city zone. [Libertarians take aim at ‘elite island ‘ of federal employment] “It’s a step in the right direction and it’s certainly an improvement for those employees, but it’s time for reasonable raises for all federal employees,” said J. David Cox, Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees and a council member. After a three-year freeze on salary rates — during which individuals still could receive raises for various reasons — federal employees received 1 percent raises in 2014 and 2015, and are in line for an average 1.3 percent increase in January. The pay gap figure is the official government word, based on the 1990 law, on how federal and non-federal salaries stack up. It is derived from Labor Department data on some 250 occupations by area, with various statistical adjustments. Federal employee organizations use the number in arguing that federal workers are underpaid, but other studies using different methods and different sets of data reach widely differing conclusions. For example, the libertarian Cato Institute recently published a report asserting that federal employees are overpaid by 78 percent on average. The conservative Heritage Foundation in 2010 found an advantage for federal workers of 22 percent. The Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2012 that salaries are roughly comparable overall, although with less educated federal employees at an advantage and more educated ones at a disadvantage. Later that year, the Government Accountability Office concluded that no one approach is definitive. For the projected 1.3 percent raise in January, 1 percentage point is to be paid across the board and the funds for the other 0.3 of a percentage point are to be divided up according to the indicated pay gaps by locality. The result will be raises slightly higher or lower than 1.3 percent. Congress could yet enact a different figure but all year it has followed a strategy of allowing that raise to take effect by default. Blue-collar employees fall under a separate locality pay system. However, for many years their raises have been set at the General Schedule amount paid in an area, not according to comparisons for blue-collar jobs. White-collar employees at senior levels are paid under separate systems that typically don’t pay raises automatically but rather link them to performance. Gender gap in federal salaries?

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Barbara for the following movie plot: The film opens with a dream sequence in which stock market tycoon Paul Marsh discovers a mermaid with razor sharp teeth while scuba diving into a carven pit. Paul awakes on a boat off the shores of Spain, where he is vacationing with his girlfriend, Barbara, and their friends Vicki and Howard. A sudden storm blows their boat against some hidden rocks. Vicki is trapped below deck, and Howard stays with her while Paul and Barbara take a lifeboat to the nearby fishing village of Imboca. During their absence, an unseen creature from the deep attacks the two in the boat. At shore, Barbara and Paul find no one about, and venture into town until they eventually reach the church, where they find a priest. Barbara convinces him to help them, and the priest speaks with two fishermen at the docks, who volunteer to take either Paul or Barbara to the wreck. Despite Paul's misgivings, Barbara stays to try to find a phone in order to call a doctor while Paul goes to help their friends. Vicki and Howard are mysteriously missing, however, and Paul is taken back to Imboca, where he is sent to the hotel that Barbara was supposed to have gone to. But she is missing as well, and Paul is left to wait for her in an old, filthy hotel room, where he dreams of the mermaid again. His fitful rest is disturbed by a large gathering of strange, fish-like people approaching the hotel and is forced to flee. He ends up in a macabre tannery full of human skins, where he discovers Howard's remains. He escapes the tannery by starting a fire, and finds momentary safety with an old drunkard named Ezequiel, the last human in Imboca. Ezequiel explains to Paul about how the village in lean times has fallen to the worship of Dagon. This brought incredible wealth to Imboca in the form of fish and gold, but also horror when Dagon demanded live sacrifices and human women (including Ezequiel's parents) to breed with. Paul begs Ezequiel to help him escape. Ezequiel relents and takes Paul to the Mayor's manor, so he can steal the town's only car. Ezequiel...

Write some highlights for the following article: The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \\"cancer-free\\" baby. \\"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. \\"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations.\\" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. \\"This is not a cure for breast cancer,\\" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? \\"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\\" she said. \\"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\\" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. \\"They will be destroyed,\\" she said. \\"They will never be allowed to live.\\" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \\"killed,\\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. \\"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\\" she said. \\"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\\" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. \\"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\\" he said. But \\"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\\" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. \\"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. \\"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\\" he asked. \\"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\\" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. \\"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\\" he said. \\"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\\" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. \\"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\\" he said. \\"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\\" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about 11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. \\"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \\"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. \\"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\\" he said. \\"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\\"","completion":"A baby girl was born in Britain after her embryo was screened to make sure she did not have a cancer gene. This special test, called genetic screening, helps doctors check if the tiny baby-to-be might have health problems later in life. In this case, they checked for a gene called BRCA-1, which can cause breast and ovarian cancer. People with this gene have a higher chance of getting these cancers. Some people are happy that the baby girl will not have to worry about these cancers in her life, but others believe that this kind of testing might lead to bad choices. One concern is that embryos that have these genes could be thrown away, which some people think is not right. While genetic testing can be helpful for some serious diseases, it also brings up questions about where we should draw the line and how far we should go in trying to avoid health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: How do I know if I am successfully removing the air bubbles from concrete while pouring when making a countertop? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To successfully remove air bubbles from concrete while pouring when making a countertop, it's essential to understand the importance of minimizing air bubbles and voids. Air bubbles and voids can compromise the strength, integrity, and aesthetics of the finished countertop. Applying suitable techniques and tools during the pouring process helps achieve a more uniform and strong concrete structure. Below are two solutions, with detailed explanations, that can assist in eliminating air bubbles from concrete when making a countertop. Solution 1: Concrete Vibrators and Proper Pouring Techniques This solution involves using a concrete vibrator to agitate the mixture, releasing trapped air bubbles and facilitating the settlement of the concrete. Concrete vibrators come in different types, such as pencil vibrators, form vibrators, and table vibrators. Ensure that the concrete vibrator is suitable for a countertop application and can effectively remove air bubbles. Follow these steps: 1. Prepare the concrete mix, ensuring it has the right blend of cement, sand, aggregate (if applicable), and water. The mix should be fluid enough to facilitate easy pouring and distribution, without being too thin or watery. 2. Pour the concrete mix into the countertop formwork, starting at one end and filling the form gradually. Avoid sudden drops and try to maintain a consistent flow level while pouring. 3. Insert the concrete vibrator into the freshly poured concrete mix to release trapped air bubbles. The vibrator should be evenly and systematically moved throughout the poured concrete, both vertically and horizontally, while ensuring that all areas are adequately covered. 4. While vibrating, monitor the surface of the concrete for air bubbles. As the vibrator agitates the mixture, you should notice reduced air bubbles coming to the surface. Additionally, the concrete should settle smoothly and consistently across the formwork, filling any gaps or voids. 5. Gradually remove the vibrator, avoiding any sudden movements that could trap air inside again. Evenly smooth the surface of the concrete using a trowel or screed. Solution 2: Manual Tapping and Agitation This solution is more labor-intensive but can be an adequate substitute if a concrete vibrator is not available. The key is to agitate the poured concrete mix manually to help release trapped air and ensure proper settlement. Follow these steps: 1. As with Solution 1, start by preparing the appropriate concrete mix to ensure proper consistency for pouring. 2. Pour the concrete mix steadily into the countertop formwork, avoiding sudden drops or disruptions in the pouring flow. 3. Use a wooden or metal rod to agitate the freshly poured concrete mix. Insert the rod into the concrete and make small circular or side-to-side motions, ensuring all areas are covered. 4. Once a sufficient amount of air bubbles have surfaced, smooth out the concrete by tapping the sides of the formwork using a rubber mallet or a hammer covered with a soft cloth. Tapping the formwork helps release trapped air bubbles and settles the concrete more uniformly. 5. Visually inspect the surface of the poured concrete. If you notice a significant reduction in visible air bubbles and a smooth, consistent settling of the mixture, you have successfully removed most of the air bubbles. 6. Utilize a screed or trowel to smooth and level the concrete surface, preparing it for finishing. In terms of naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 involving the use of concrete vibrators and proper pouring techniques can be considered a more sound solution. Utilizing a concrete vibrator provides more consistent and effective results in removing air bubbles from the freshly poured concrete mix. Additionally, it requires less manual labor and delivers a smoother concrete surface, which is vital for achieving an aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound countertop. However, Solution 2 offers a viable alternative for those who may not have access to a concrete vibrator or prefer a hands-on approach. Ultimately, it's crucial to employ the necessary techniques and tools to maximize air bubble removal and guarantee a strong, long-lasting, and visually appealing concrete countertop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This incredible X-Ray shows how a farmer was millimetres from death when an 18-inch metal prong speared his torso but miraculously missed all his vital organs after snagging on his key fob. Graham Heatley, 52, was speared through the right buttock by the bailing fork which came out the lower left side of his stomach after he forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor and it rolled back downhill towards him. Emergency services rushed to Mr Heatley's 160 acre farm in Lyneal, Shropshire, after neighbours heard his cries for help. An X-Ray shows the spike pierced through Graham Heatley's body but was stopped from going further by his key chain. The accident happened after Mr Heatley forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor (pictured) and it rolled back downhill towards him. Mr Heatley was flown to hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition with the spike still sticking out of his body. He then underwent a four-hour operation at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found the prong had missed his vital organs by just 1.5cm. Incredibly, he was out of hospital within six days of the fork being removed. Mr Heatley, who runs the 160 acre farm with his mum Mary, 78, said he knew he was in trouble when he felt a 'sharp twinge' in his backside. He went on: 'I had picked up some up some hay and had placed it on the floor to cut the wrap and I don’t think I applied the hand-brake properly on the tractor because I felt this fork going into me. 'As I was bending over I felt this sharp twinge and I knew that’s when I was in trouble. 'I turned to work out what was happening I saw it was rolling towards me and the tine went into my right buttock. 'It ended up going through and poked out of my abdomen on the left.

Mr Heatley (right) underwent a four-hour operation at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found the prong had missed his vital organs by just 1.5cm. One of the bailing fork's 18-inch metal spikes (pictured) passed through Mr Heatley's right buttock and came out of the left side of his stomach. 'I just had to let it, I couldn’t do anything else. All I was thinking about was how I was going get free. 'All I could do was shout for help so I was shouting as loud as I could but I knew no one was at home at the farm. 'Luckily some neighbours heard me and they drove down the lane to find out what was going on. 'As they saw me they got out and ran towards me. 'They then called 999 and everyone came along, the ambulance, police, fire engine, and air ambulance. 'To get me free they had to unbolt the tine (prong) from the tractor and they then got me on a stretcher and put me in the air ambulance with it still in me. 'They then flew me hospital which only took 12 minutes. At first they struggled to close the helicopter’s door with the tine sticking out. I was awake the whole time. 'I was taken to A&E and transferred to theatre and at that point I don’t really remember much more. 'Because [the spike] hit my key fob it stopped going through my body any further and the surgeon said they just had to pull it out a bit at a time.

The accident happened after Mr Heatley left the handbrake of his tractor off and it rolled back towards him. 'I just say thank God for my keys. They probably saved my life.' Surgeon Neil Yeomans, who performed the four-hour operation, said it was one of the most unusual injuries he has ever had to deal with. He said: 'We put him through the scanner to see what exactly we were dealing with. 'We then had to put him on the operating table in the theatre at 45 degrees because of how the spike was sticking through him. 'To keep him at that angle we had to use sandbags to prop him up and support him, which is highly unusual. 'We then had to ease his clothes off around the spike as he was fully clothed. 'I then had to operate on him on his side, which can be quite difficult when you are not used to doing it. 'In total three of us were doing the surgery and we just had to pull the spike in a controlled direction. 'The spike had entered the pelvis and was only 1.5cm from his urethra and it was only an inch from the vessel in front of the rectum and behind the bladder. So it missed the rectal tube. 'If the spike hadn’t missed any of those then it would have been life threatening and he could have been left having to use a colostomy bag. 'Mr Heatley was extremely lucky and he has recovered amazingly well.' Graham Heatley, 52, avoided serious injury when the spike hit his key fob.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"El Niño can indirectly impact a step of the process of hurricane formation. Specifically, it can influence the environmental conditions that favor or inhibit the development of tropical cyclones, which in turn can result in changes in wind speeds. El Niño is a climate phenomenon characterized by an irregularly occurring warming of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which can cause changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. This leads to anomalies in wind patterns and sea surface temperatures across the tropical regions, affecting weather patterns worldwide. When it comes to hurricanes, El Niño tends to increase wind shear in the Atlantic basin, which inhibits hurricane formation and intensification. On the other hand, it tends to decrease wind shear and create more favorable conditions for hurricane development in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. So in the context of hurricane formation, El Niño can indirectly impact a step of the process by altering the atmospheric conditions that allow for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify. While El Nino doesn't directly impact a specific step in the process outlined above, its influence on the overall conditions in the atmosphere can affect the likelihood and intensity of hurricanes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \\"execute the spies\\".

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Answer the above question based on the context below: Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.

What is the answer??","completion":"We are given the equation: 214*z + 305*z - 852 - 1776 - 2562 = 0. To solve for z, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms. The like terms are the terms with the variable z, which are 214*z and 305*z, and the constant terms, which are -852, -1776, and -2562. 214*z + 305*z = 519*z (adding the coefficients of z terms) -852 - 1776 - 2562 = -5190 (adding the constants) So, our simplified equation is: 519*z - 5190 = 0 Step 2: Solve for z. We want to isolate z on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to move the constant term to the other side. 519*z = 5190 Now, to isolate z, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 519. z = 5190 / 519 Step 3: Simplify the fraction to get the value of z. 5190 and 519 share a common factor of 519. z = (5190 / 519) = (519 * 10) / 519 When we divide 5190 by 519, we get 10. z = 10 The solution to the equation is z = 10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information: - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures. - The flying buttress (arc-boutant, arch buttress) is a specific form of buttress composed of an arched structure that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs. - Kaliningrad Oblast (\\"Kaliningradskaya oblast\\") is a federal subject of the Russian Federation that is located on the coast of the Baltic Sea. As an oblast, its constitutional status is equal to each of the other 84 federal subjects. Its administrative center is the city of Kaliningrad, formerly known as Königsberg. It is the only Baltic port in the Russian Federation that remains ice-free in winter. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 941,873. - Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as \\"\\" (\\"French work\\") with the term \\"Gothic\\" first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms. - The Church of the Visitation of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ( Polish : Koció Nawiedzenia Najwitszej Marii Panny ) , otherwise known as St. Mary 's Church ( Koció Mariacki ) is a church in Warsaw , Poland . It is one of oldest buildings and one of the few surviving examples of Gothic architecture in the city . It is located at ulica Przyrynek 2 . - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe.

Article: These days, when the world seems to be hard to control, walking can make you feel peaceful. It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water. Then pick up your backpack and head out. And enjoy yourself. Question: From the passage, we can know _ .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I read this background article the other day: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. I am facing a new situation today: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that Jeff, who experienced a significant growth spurt during puberty, would have certain advantages in playing basketball compared to soccer, due to his increased height. In basketball, height plays a crucial role in various aspects of the game, such as rebounding, shot blocking, and having an easier time shooting over shorter defenders. A taller player like Jeff would be more likely to excel in these areas, giving him an edge in the game. On the other hand, while height can be an advantage in soccer, especially for goalkeepers or players competing for headers, soccer places a greater emphasis on skills such as dribbling, passing, and shooting, which do not necessarily correlate with height. Therefore, the advantages Jeff gains from his height might not be as significant in soccer as they would be in basketball. However, it is important to note that physical traits such as height are not the sole determinants of success in any sport. Factors such as athleticism, skill level, mental toughness, and dedication also play significant roles in determining a player's ability to excel in a particular sport. Therefore, while Jeff might have an advantage in basketball due to his height, his overall success in either sport would still be dependent on a variety of other factors. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the background article, Jeff would likely be better suited to play basketball due to his increased height, as height plays a more significant role in the game of basketball compared to soccer. However, it is essential to consider other factors such as skills, athleticism, and dedication when evaluating a person's potential success in any sport."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What had \\"killed and severely injured lake bathers recently?\\" from the following article ? Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

How can I define my self-identity? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To address the first question, how people define their identity, let me break it down step by step: 1. Personal experiences: People often look at their past and present experiences, including family, education, career, and relationships, to define who they are. These experiences shape their values, beliefs, and preferences. 2. Interests and hobbies: People's passions, hobbies, and activities that they enjoy in their free time also contribute to their identities. These interests help to distinguish them from others and give them a sense of purpose or belonging. 3. Values and beliefs: A person's values and beliefs form a significant part of their identity. People often define themselves by their opinions on various subjects, like politics, religion, and morality. 4. Group affiliations: People often find identity within the groups they associate with, such as family, cultural groups, or social circles. These connections allow them to feel a sense of belonging. 5. Personality traits: A person's natural tendencies, like being introverted or extroverted, organized, or spontaneous, contribute to their overall identity as well. Regarding the second question, how to define one's self-identity, here are some steps: 1. Self-reflection: Engage in introspection to explore your personal experiences, beliefs, values, and interests. 2. Identify your strengths and weaknesses: Recognize and list your unique qualities, strengths, and areas where you may need improvement. Acknowledging these aspects helps you understand your individuality. 3. Consider your personal values and beliefs: Reflect on your core beliefs and values, such as religious beliefs, moral principles, and political affiliations. These beliefs and values shape your decision-making and actions, which contribute to your self-identity. 4. Acknowledge your interests and hobbies: Pinpoint the activities and hobbies that you enjoy most and provide you with a sense of individuality and accomplishment. 5. Recognize your social connections and group affiliations: Evaluate your relationships with friends, family, and cultural or social groups that are important to you and influence your sense of belonging. Now, to determine if these two questions are the same: Upon analysis, these two questions are related but distinct. The first question asks how people, in general, define their identity. My response addresses the various components that people consider when defining their identities. The second question is more personalized, specifically asking how you can define your own self-identity. The response I provided for this question outlines a process for discovering and understanding one's identity. In summary, while these two questions are intertwined in subject matter, they address different aspects of the topic: one being more focused on understanding the concept of identity, and the other on defining and discovering personal identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving.

It could be rather expensive.\\" I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. \\"I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed.\\" he told me. That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring happily. I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. \\"I think you've given me the wrong account,\\" I said to the clerk. \\"This is only 85.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

It specifically mentions the success of the Not Your Father's Root Beer brand and the existence of at least 39 hard soda brands in the country. Step 2: Identify the key points - Hard soda is a type of alcoholic beverage - It has gained recent prominence in the United States - The success of the Not Your Father's Root Beer brand - At least 39 hard soda brands exist in the United States Step 3: Make connections The context shows that hard soda has gained popularity in the United States, as indicated by the success of one brand and the creation of numerous brands within a certain period.

Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO --California regulators late Thursday adopted the first large-scale cap-and-trade program in the U.S., in a move officials say will protect the environment without hurting the state's still-struggling economy. In a 9-1 vote, the state Air Resources Board voted to adopt rules, scheduled to start in 2012, that place a limit on greenhouse-gas emissions for the state that will decline over time. Power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide and can't cut their emissions by the required amount will be able to obtain pollution allowances from the state or buy them from other emitters with excess allowances. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the cap-and-trade rules will help fight climate change and also boost California's clean-technology industry and overall economy. \\"Billions of dollars are being poured into California in clean technology venture capital investment,\\" Mr. Schwarzenegger said. \\"Of course, we have to be sensitive because it's an economic downturn, and this Air Resources Board knows they have to be sensitive. But we have to reach our goals by 2020.\\" Companies with facilities that emit carbon dioxide could also purchase carbon credits, or offsets, tied to emission-reduction projects, such as forests that are managed to contain carbon dioxide, to comply with required emission cuts. Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said there was still work to be done, including ensuring safeguards against manipulation of the market-based program and establishing a \\"community benefits fund\\" that would use some auction funds to help low-income families manage potential increases in energy prices. She added that the board was mindful of proceeding with the rules without overburdening consumers, businesses or the economy. \\"We are being cautious and careful within the context of a very bold effort,\\" Mrs. Nichols said. The new rules come less than a week after the world's nations reached agreement on a package of climate initiatives last week at a United Nations-sponsored summit in Cancun, Mexico. And they come six weeks after a referendum in which Californians voted to keep the state's climate law intact. A federal proposal to limit U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, however, has stalled in Congress amid political bickering. Recent scientific studies have found that many of the earth's largest lakes have been warming more quickly than the air around them in the last 25 years, and that many glaciers around the world have been melting at an increasingly rapid pace, particularly in southern South America and Alaska. California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition to the proposed cap-and-trade program, the state has established an aggressive renewable-energy mandate and a requirement that the carbon content of the state's vehicle fuels be cut by 10% by 2020, as part of efforts to achieve the emissions-reduction goal. Under the proposed cap-and-trade rules, the state would give away most allowances in the first few years of the cap-and-trade program, then sell many allowances in auctions in later years. Industries that could prove the regulations were putting them at a significant competitive advantage to companies in other states could be eligible for additional free allowances. The proposed rules would establish a floor on the price of allowances sold at auction of 10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide. Environmental groups argued for greater auctioning of pollution allowances, while heavy industry groups pressed for more allowance giveaways. \\"We don't need an auction,\\" said Dorothy Rothrock, a spokeswoman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \\"We think it's an extra burden on industries attempting to comply with this regulation.\\" But the Sierra Club said the provision would benefit companies that were unlikely to leave the state. Other environmental groups lauded the cap-and-trade program. \\"It's a step forward that will make our country more competitive and make California a leader in the clean technology industry,\\" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. Greenhouse-gas emitters could purchase carbon offsets--which are expected to trade at a discount to emission allowances--to comply with 8% of their annual emission obligations. Carbon market participants said carbon offset prices have jumped in anticipation of California's adoption of the cap-and-trade rules. Lenny Hochschild, a carbon broker with Evolution Markets, said offset prices have doubled from about 4 a ton of carbon dioxide to 8 a ton amid much higher volumes of trade in recent weeks. Environmental groups and residents of California's forest regions have asked the ARB to exclude companies that clear-cut forests from participating in the offset program. The ARB has said it will consider allowing carbon credits from a range of other types of projects, from forest protection projects in Mexico and other countries, to projects aimed at destroying ozone-depleting substances. Some carbon market participants say the agency should act quickly to approve more types of projects to avoid a lack of supply of such credits to meet demand. Write to Cassandra Sweet at cassandra.sweet@dowjones.com ||||| California regulators Thursday voted to cap the greenhouse gas emissions of the state's major industries and establish the nation's first broad-based carbon trading program.The move marks another bellwether moment for a state that has led in environmental policy, coming as national climate legislation to regulate greenhouse gases and curb climate change has stalled in Congress.\\"This is an historic venture,\\" said Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, as the panel voted 9 to 1 to approve some 3,000 pages of regulations and supporting documents, crafted over three years of intense negotiations with businesses and public interest groups.Given the state's fragile economy, Nichols said, \\"most political people said we should do as little as possible as slowly as possible.\\" Instead, she said, \\"we are being cautious and careful, but in the context of a very bold effort.\\" Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a champion of a market-based approach to climate regulation, showed up partway through a 10-hour public hearing at the board's headquarters to applaud the agency's effort to develop trading rules for carbon emissions. \\"We have led the nation in developing green policies,\\" he said. \\"And we have seen our green economy grow as a result.\\"California's 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act requires the state to slash greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 — amounting to a 15% cut below today's levels.The complex cap-and-trade system is a centerpiece of the state's multifaceted plan. Already approved are rules to hike the fuel efficiency of automobiles, cut the energy intensity of gasoline and source a third of the state's electricity from renewable sources.More than 180 industry executives, environmentalists and concerned citizens testified on the trading regulations, which will limit emissions from 600 major industrial plants in the state. Representatives of the cement, electrical and agribusiness sectors picked apart aspects of the rules, as did forest conservationists, health advocates and anti-poverty lawyers.In the day's most contentious debate, more than a score of environmentalists and residents of Sierra Nevada communities showed up to protest provisions that would allow industrial plants to reduce their obligation to curb pollution at their own facilities by allowing them to purchase offsets from timber companies that pledge to tailor their practices to preserve more carbon in forests.Several board members sought to exclude a part of the regulation that allows parcels to be clear-cut and replanted. They were voted down, 7 to 3.The forest rules divided the environmental community, with such groups as the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund — both strong backers of carbon trading — siding with Sierra Pacific, the state's largest timber company, in support of the rule as written. Local activists from Sierra Nevada communities, backed by the Sierra Club, pleaded with the board to exclude any trading that could encourage clear-cutting and the replacement of natural forests with single-species plantations.\\"We want California to be the leader on climate, not a laughingstock,\\" said Addie Jacobson, a board member of the Sierra Nevada Alliance who said she spoke for 85 organizations.Only one air board member voted against the overall cap-and-trade program: John Telles, a physician who represents the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Telles said the measure would not protect low-income residents from energy price hikes. He also suggested that a carbon trading market would be open to \\"manipulation,\\" as was the case with California's disastrous deregulation of electricity markets in the 1990s.Under the plan, the state would cap each industrial plant's emissions in 2012, gradually lowering the cap over the next eight years. Firms would be granted allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide they could emit.Many speakers at the public hearing criticized the board's decision to ignore its own economic advisory committee's recommendation to auction those allowances from the start of the program, rather than give them to industry and phase in auctions.\\"Auctioning provides a sharper price signal,\\" said UC Berkeley economist Michael Hanneman, adding that giving away allowances for free \\"risks granting windfall profits\\" to industry. |||||Summary:","completion":"California has a new rule to help protect the environment. They made a cap-and-trade program. It's the first big one in the U.S. Cap-and-trade is a way to limit pollution. It gives companies a limit on how much pollution they can make. If a company can't cut their pollution enough, they can buy allowances. This lets them keep polluting but only for a little while. The idea is to make pollution go down little by little over time. This plan aims to fight climate change. It also hopes to make California a leader in clean technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These are the two most common oils used by movie theaters. Heat a thin layer of oil until shimmering in a large pot. Add a few test kernels, then add the rest of the popcorn when they pop. Remove from heat for thirty seconds so the kernels reach an even temperature. Return to heat then cook, shaking occasionally, until popped. You'll need about ⅓ cup popcorn kernels for a 6 quart (5.6 L) pot. Many theaters add a salt product that contains artificial butter flavor, often sold under the brand name Flavacol. You can order this online to add to your own popcorn. Since 1 tsp (5 mL) Flavacol contains 116% of the FDA-recommended daily sodium limit, it's best to sprinkle sparingly. Theater employees typically toss in the Flavacol before popping. However, Flavacol does release airborne chemicals when heated which could cause harm over long term use. This is unlikely to happen if you only make popcorn for personal use, but you can add the Flavacol after cooking if you are concerned. The Flavacol should already add that artificial butter flavor, but if you want that greasy feel on your tongue and fingers, you can buy a jug of \\"popcorn topping\\" online. Drizzle this on top to taste after your popcorn is ready. As you might imagine, this is mostly hydrogenated fat, and not the best for your health.

A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner.

Title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital. Seemingly minutes after they leave, gunshots are heard outside and the lights...

In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

Although many civilians had used them as such during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel, and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940 about 150,000 a night slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less.

However beneficent his reputation the sordid past of such men and institutions keeps coming back to afflict his papacy like a recurrent debilitating disease. Things arenât much better for the pope in Chile where Francis will begin his official apostolic visit when he arrives Monday evening. Francis recently appointed controversial Bishop Juan Barros to head the diocese of the city of Osorno in the south of the country even though Barros worked directly under Fernando Karadima a priest convicted of sexual abuse by the Vatican and sentenced to the usual âlife of prayer and penitenceâ in a secluded monastery. Barros denies knowing of Karadimaâs crimes even though he is named by several witnesses as ultimately aiding in the cover-up and sent a letter to the Vatican in support of the known predator during the Vaticanâs investigation. According to documents seen by the Associated Press Francis considered sending Barros on a sabbatical to avoid any potential dust-up among abuse survivors but as the AP reports it was a decision â he didn't ultimately take.â Last Friday four Catholic churches in Santiago were firebombed ahead of the popeâs visit.

If you are experiencing vertigo and have recently been diagnosed with BPPV, you should to go to a doctor who will perform the Epley maneuver to reposition your inner ear crystals. A doctor or therapist is the only person who should do this maneuver if this is your first time experiencing BPPV. However, they will teach you how to perform it on yourself, just in case your symptoms return in the future. While you can do the maneuver at home (covered in Method Two of this article), going through the process with a doctor first will help you understand what it feels like to have the procedure done correctly. Trying at home without any context can actual further displace your ear crystals and make your vertigo worse! If you already know what this procedure feels like when done correctly, you can move to method two to refresh your memory on how to perform it. The doctor will seat you on the edge of a table or bed, with your head facing forward. Your doctor will then place one hand on each side of your head and will quickly move your head 45 degrees to the right. She will then immediately lie you down on the table so that your head is still in the 45 degree angle to the right. Your doctor will ask you to remain in this position for 30 seconds. Your head will be lying off the examination table or, if you have a pillow behind your back, your head will be on the table. Whatever level your head is resting at, the goal is to have your head lower than the rest of your body when you lie down. While you remain in the position she has just placed you in, she will reposition herself and then quickly rotate your head 90 degrees to the opposite side (which means that she will turn your head so that it is facing to the left). You should pay attention to any feelings of vertigo that you have. These will most likely stop after 30 seconds in this new position. Next the doctor will ask you to roll onto your left side, while she rapidly rotates your head to the right (your nose will now be angled at the floor). To visualize what you will be doing, imagine that you are lying on your right side on your bed, but your face is pointing down into your pillow. You will hold this position for 30 seconds. Double check the rotation side and nose direction. Note that if your doctor determines the problem is on the right, they will rotate your body and head to the left, and vice versa. After 30 seconds, your doctor will quickly lift you into a sitting position. You should not feel any vertigo at this time; if you do, this maneuver can be repeated until you are no longer having vertigo. Sometimes it takes more than one maneuver to get all of your inner ear crystals back into their proper places. Note that, for BPPV on the LEFT side, the same procedure should be performed with the sides reversed. After your appointment with the doctor, you might be given a soft neck brace that you will most likely be instructed to wear for the rest of the day. Your doctor will also give you instructions on how to sleep and move around so that you do not experience vertigo again. These instructions are covered in Part 3 of this article. Summary:","completion":"1. Visit a doctor if diagnosed with BPPV and experiencing vertigo. 2. Doctor or therapist perform Epley maneuver to reposition inner ear crystals. 3.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Dreamgirls is a 2006 American romantic musical drama film written and directed by Bill Condon and jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. Adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by composer Henry Krieger and lyricist/librettist Tom Eyen, Dreamgirls is a film a clef, a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the Motown record label and one of its acts, The Supremes. The story follows the history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive. The film adaptation of Dreamgirls stars Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, and also features Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson. Dreamgirls musical supervisors Randy Spendlove and Matt Sullivan hired R&B production team The Underdogs -- Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas -- to restructure and rearrange the Henry Krieger/Tom Eyen Dreamgirls score so that it better reflected its proper time period, yet also reflected then-modern R&B/pop sensibilities. During post-production, composer Stephen Trask was contracted to provide additional score material for the film. Several musical numbers from the Broadway score were not included in the film version, in particular Lorrell's solo \\"Ain't No Party\\". Four new songs were added for the film: \\"Love You I Do\\", \\"Patience\\", \\"Perfect World,\\" and \\"Listen.\\" All of the new songs feature music composed by original Dreamgirls stage composer Henry Krieger. With Tom Eyen having died in 1991, various lyricists were brought in by Krieger to co-author the new songs. \\"Love You I Do,\\" with lyrics by Siedah Garrett, is performed in the film by Effie during a rehearsal at the Rainbow Records studio. Willie Reale wrote the lyrics for \\"Patience,\\" a song performed in the film by Jimmy, Lorrell, C.C., and a gospel choir, as the characters attempt to record a message song for Jimmy. \\"Perfect World,\\" also featuring lyrics by Garrett, is performed during the Rainbow 10th anniversary special sequence by Jackson 5 doppelgangers The Campbell Connection. \\"Listen\\", with additional music by Scott Cutler and Beyonce Knowles, and lyrics by Anne Preven, is presented as a defining moment for Deena's character late in the film. After preview screenings during the summer of 2006, several minutes worth of musical footage were deleted from the film due to negative audience reactions to the amount of music. Among this footage was one whole musical number, C.C. and Effie's sung reunion \\"Effie, Sing My Song\\", which was replaced with an alternative spoken version. The Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack album was released on December 5 by Music World Entertainment/Columbia Records, in both a single-disc version containing highlights and a double-disc \\"Deluxe Version\\" containing all of the film's songs. The single-disc version of the soundtrack peaked at number-one on the Billboard 200 during a slow sales week in early January 2007. \\"Listen\\" was the first official single from the soundtrack, supported by a music video featuring Beyonce. \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" was the Dreamgirls soundtrack's second single. Though a music video with all-original footage was once planned, the video eventually released for \\"And I Am Telling You\\" comprised the entire corresponding scene in the actual film.

A:","completion":"Former municipality Pizy merged with the municipality of Vinzel in Switzerland. This merger took place on July 1, 2011. The two municipalities are located in the district of Nyon in the canton of Vaud. The merge was part of a broader trend of smaller municipalities consolidating in order to benefit from improved administrative efficiency, better allocation of resources, and optimized service provision to the residents. The area of Pizy before the merger was 2.87 square kilometers, while Vinzel had an area of 1.34 square kilometers. The amalgamation led to a larger and more sustainable municipality with an area of approximately 4.21 square kilometers. In terms of population, both municipalities had a relatively small number of residents. At the time of the merger, Pizy had a population of around 218 people, and Vinzel had 297 residents. Consequently, the new municipality's combined population was approximately 515 inhabitants. The primary language spoken in Pizy and Vinzel is French, as it is in the majority of the canton of Vaud. The region boasts a rich Swiss history and is known for its picturesque landscapes featuring vineyards, small villages, and beautiful views of Lake Geneva and the Alps. It is also an agricultural area with a focus on wine production. The merging of municipalities such as Pizy and Vinzel is relatively common in Switzerland, particularly in the 21st century. This consolidation aims at creating sustainable communities by pooling resources, improving infrastructures, and providing better facilities and services to residents without overburdening them with additional taxes. To sum up, the municipality that the former municipality Pizy merged with in Switzerland is Vinzel. This merger took place on July 1, 2011, and was a part of a broader trend of smaller Swiss municipalities consolidating to create more substantial, sustainable, and efficient governing bodies. The new municipality resulting from this merger now has a combined population of approximately 515 residents and covers a total area of around 4.21 square kilometers. The region is primarily French-speaking and is known for its picturesque landscapes and agricultural focus on wine production."},{"prompt":"Definition: Given a set of five words, generate the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words.

Write an article using the following points: 2,400 workers surveyed on what they would value most at Christmas. 57 per cent of those quizzed said they would like a £250 cash bonus. Just one in ten would opt for two extra days of annual leave. Only 2 per cent picked the generous option of donating £250 to charity. Article:","completion":"Title: Survey Reveals Cash Bonuses as Top Christmas Wish for Workers Introduction: As the holiday season draws near, businesses are gearing up for their annual traditions: office parties, festive decorations, and, for some, employee gifts or bonuses. But do these companies really know what their workers want for Christmas? A recent survey sought to find out. Step 1: Present the survey details In an effort to uncover what employees truly value during the holiday season, a survey reached out to 2,400 workers to gather their opinions. The participants were asked to choose one of three options: a £250 cash bonus, two additional days of annual leave, or donating £250 to a charity of their choice. Step 2: Highlight the key findings The results of the survey revealed that a significant majority – 57% of the workers – would most appreciate a £250 cash bonus as their Christmas reward. This suggests that a financial incentive remains a powerful tool to boost employee morale and satisfaction. Step 3: Discuss the less popular options On the other hand, it appears that additional time off is not a top priority for most surveyed workers. Only one in ten participants would like to receive two extra days of annual leave as their Christmas gift. This could indicate that, for many employees, the holiday period itself provides sufficient time to rest and recharge. Step 4: Discuss the least popular option Interestingly, a mere 2% of the respondents chose the option to donate £250 to charity. While it is a noble choice, it appears that most workers prioritize their own needs and desires over giving during the festive season. Step 5: Analyze the implications for businesses These survey findings could pave the way for more tailored holiday rewards in the future. Employers seeking to boost employee satisfaction during the festive season may consider providing cash bonuses to their staff in response to the overwhelming preference for financial rewards. Conclusion: The Christmas season offers businesses a unique opportunity to recognize and reward their employees' hard work and dedication throughout the year. This survey highlights the importance of understanding what workers truly value, and in this case, a £250 cash bonus emerged as the clear winner. Offering financial incentives to staff can go a long way in fostering a happy and motivated workforce during the holidays and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: the plot \` surprises Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"Interpreting the positivity or negativity of a statement can be quite challenging as it often depends on context, tone, and interpretation. The statement provided, \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\", is quite neutral or ambiguous on its own. It lacks sufficient context to draw a clear cut conclusion. If the movie review sentence \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\" is considered in isolation, we cannot definitively state it's either positive or negative. The term \\"surprises\\" alone does not denote a positive or negative connotation. The surprises could be seen as exciting plot twists, which would be considered positive. On the other hand, the surprises could be seen as unexpected and disjointed plot developments, which would be perceived as negative. However, movie reviews typically contain more information about whether the surprises are evaluated positively, like \\"the plot was full of pleasant surprises\\", or negatively, such as \\"the plot had too many unpleasant surprises, leading to confusion\\". Ideally, if we dive into specifics, we could have validated a more context-based perspective of the term. In short, the sentence \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\" does not provide sufficient information to establish it as positive or negative. You need more context to categorize the tone of the statement definitively. Typically, movie reviewers will provide more information about how they perceive the \\"surprises\\" in a film's plot, clarifying whether they found them positive or negative.

And now, 102 years on from its heyday, one of the capital's original motorised black cabs is ready to hit the road again after years wasting away in a British barn. The incredibly-rare French-made Panhard-Levassor motor, one of only hundreds made for Britain, was picking up London's upper classes in 1910, and is now up for auction. Toot toot! This incredibly rare original London black cab from 1910 has emerged from a barn in Gloucestershire where it has been languishing for 15 years It was only in the 1930s that the cabs had to be","completion":"painted black, making this 1910 model one of the earliest examples of the iconic British vehicle that would later be associated with the dark color. Although it was produced by a French company, Panhard-Levassor, it was designed and built specifically to cater to the British market, particularly the well-to-do clientele in London who no longer wanted to rely on horse-drawn carriages for transportation. At the time, the streets of London were congested with horses and carriages, which were becoming increasingly dated with the rise of motor vehicles. The government was seeking an alternative, and the appearance of this motorized taxicab helped pave the way for the eventual decline of horse-drawn carriages. The Panhard-Levassor cab was unique in its design. It featured a spacious, enclosed passenger compartment that could accommodate up to five passengers. The driver's seat was elevated at the front, providing an unobstructed view of the road and allowing for easier navigation through the crowded city streets. The cab was powered by a 4-cylinder engine, providing a much smoother and more comfortable ride compared to horse-drawn carriages. Despite its age, this 1910 model has aged incredibly well, thanks to being stored in a barn in Gloucestershire, UK, for the past 15 years. It has been mostly protected from the elements and, as a result, the woodwork, brass fittings, and leather are still in excellent condition. The only damage sustained appears to be a dent on the radiator, likely acquired during its heyday in the City. However, this dent adds character to the historical value of the vehicle. After years in storage, the vehicle is ready to return to the road, and enthusiasts will have the opportunity to bid for this classic automobile at auction. The vehicle's pedigree, together with its rarity and historical significance, is expected to fetch somewhere between £30,000-£35,000 (40,000-46,000). If successfully restored and maintained, this 1910 black cab could potentially become an invaluable piece of transportation history. Not only because of its rich past and connection to one of the world's most famous cities, but also as a symbol of the technological advancements that would eventually lead to the eradication of horse-drawn carriages and the birth of the modern taxi industry. In terms of vehicles that have shaped the identity of a city, few are more iconic than the black cab. The Panhard-Levassor motor was in many ways a trailblazer, representing the beginning of an era where motorized transportation became more accessible and commonplace. It symbolizes a time when London began transitioning from a bustling horse-drawn carriage hub into the modern metropolis we know today, making this a truly unique piece of British history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout.

News article: TV Viewership Declining and Streaming on the Rise, Nielsen Says The long-prognosticated death of TV may be happening before our eyes—but at a glacial pace. A new in-depth report from tracking firm Nielsen shows that TV is still by far America’s favorite entertainment past-time, but individuals are spending more hours surfing web and viewing streaming services. A growing number of households are choosing to dump TV altogether. About 2.6 million households are now “broadband only,” meaning they don’t subscribe to cable or pick up a broadcast signal, according to Nielsen’s Total Audience Report, released December 3. That figure comprises about 2.8% of total U.S. households and is more than double the 1.1% of households that were broadband only last year. At the same time, overall viewing of traditional TV is continuing its slow decline. The average person watched about 141 hours of live television per month in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 147 hours in the third quarter of 2013. On a daily basis, viewers are watching 12 minutes less TV than they were a year ago. Overall, 2014 has seen a significantly more precipitous decline in TV viewing than any previous year, Nielsen reports. Not surprisingly, streaming services like Netflix have benefitted from the decline in TV viewing. Forty percent of households now subscribe to a subscription video on demand service such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video, up from 35% in 2013. Thirteen percent of households now have a multimedia device like an Apple TV to stream such content. The same percentage of households have smart TVs, which natively stream apps like Netflix. On computers, viewing of online video increased by about 4 hours per month year-over-year to 10 hours and 42 minutes. More viewers are also using DVRs or video on-demand services offered by their cable provider to watch TV after its live airing. Viewers spent 14 hours and 20 minutes per month watching so-called time-shifted TV during the most recent quarter, up from 13 hours and 12 minutes a year ago. It helps to keep these shifts in perspective and recognize that TV isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Overall viewers spend about 14 and a half hours watching video on their phones, computers and multimedia devices, or about a tenth of tenth of the time they spend watching TV. But with CBS having just launched an online version of its channel and HBO prepping a cable-free version of HBO Go for sometime next year, these trends will likely continue to accelerate. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"In simple words, this news article is saying that fewer people are watching TV these days. Instead, they are using the internet to watch movies and shows on websites like Netflix. This change is happening slowly, but more and more people are choosing to not have cable TV at home.

Dogs playing in the grass is an ordinary spectacle. Playing is a natural behavior of dogs that serves both physical exercise needs as well as mental stimulation. It serves as a way for dogs to interact with each other, practice social skills, and burn off energy. Dogs also use play to explore their environment, get to know other dogs, and learn about their own abilities and limitations. It can involve a variety of actions, including running, chasing each other, barking, pawing, nipping, jumping, and even wrestling. Their play may mimic predatory behaviors, as they often engage in activities like stalking, chasing, pouncing, biting, and shaking toys. These actions are typically observed during their play and also their interaction with humans and other dogs.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Weddings in the United States vary as much as the people do. There are church weddings with a great deal of fanfare ; there are weddings on mountain tops with guests barefooted; there have been weddings on the ocean floor with oxygen tanks for the guests. But many weddings, no matter where or how they are performed, include certain traditional customs. Before a couple is married, they become engaged. And then invitations are sent to those who live nearby, their close friends and their relatives who live far away. When everything is ready, then comes the most exciting moment. The wedding itself usually lasts between 30 and 40 minutes. The wedding party enters the church while the wedding march is played. The bride carrying a bouquet enters last with her father who will \\"give her away\\". The groom enters the church from a side door. When the wedding party is gathered by the altar, the bride and groom exchange vows . It is traditional to use the words \\"to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.\\" Following the vows, the couple exchange rings. Wearing the wedding rings on the fourth finger of the left hand is an old custom. After the ceremony, there is often a party, called a \\"reception\\" which gives the wedding guests an opportunity to congratulate the new couple. The car in which the couple leaves the church is decorated with balloons. The words \\"Just Married\\" are painted on the trunk or back window. And then the couple go in their honeymoon.

C: How to congratulate the new couple. D: The estimated cost of a wedding ceremony. A:","completion":"To determine the most probable next topic the author would discuss, let's analyze the flow of the article so far. The article talks about the variety of weddings in the United States, the traditional customs involved, the engagement, wedding ceremony, and the reception. The mentioned topics focus on the events and customs related to weddings. Given this context, let's evaluate each option: A: The food served in the wedding party - This option is related to the events and customs of a wedding, making it a relevant choice. B: The possible places where the new couple spends their honeymoon - This option focuses on the honeymoon, which is mentioned briefly at the end of the article but is not about the wedding itself. C: How to congratulate the new couple - This option could be relevant as the article discussed the reception, which offers a chance for guests to congratulate the couple. However, it seems less directly related to the main events and customs of weddings. D: The estimated cost of a wedding ceremony - This option, while related to weddings, does not focus on the customs or events at weddings, rather the financial aspect.

Help as much as you can. Q:Given the background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl and the situation: Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week. Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. Answer the following question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","completion":"The shielding effect is larger in cesium. This is because cesium has more electron shells than lithium and the increased number of inner electrons will result in a greater shielding effect for the outermost electrons. As a result, the attractive force between the nucleus and the valence electron in cesium is weaker, making it easier to remove the electron and leading to a lower ionization energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\" following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son? is inside the article: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"Ilya"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden. On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show (\\"Cello Song\\", \\"Three Hours\\", \\"River Man\\", \\"Time of No Reply\\" and an early version of \\"Bryter Layter\\"), three of which were broadcast on the following night.

At the residence, Braun spends her spare time with trivial pursuits such as whimsically dancing in the nude, humming to military style marching band music, and rummaging through Hitler's personal belongings. Later, Braun is thrilled to learn that her beloved \\"Adi\\", as she affectionately calls him, will be joining her for a visit. Hitler is accompanied by guests Joseph Goebbels (Leonid Sokol), Magda Goebbels (Yelena Spiridonova), Martin Bormann (Vladimir Bogdanov) and a priest (Anatoli Shvedersky) for conversation and playful banter.[1] During his stop-over, Hitler raves and rants on topics ranging from food, health and climate change to wartime politics during interactions with his immediate personnel.

Are in a system called SS7 that allows the world's cellular carriers to route calls, texts and other services to each other. Claims security services could be exploiting flaws.","completion":"Title: Flaws in the SS7 System: A Potential Threat at the Hacker Conference in Hamburg Introduction The hacker conference in Hamburg this month is expected to draw attention to the flaws in a system known as Signaling System 7 (SS7). Interestingly, SS7 is an essential technological innovation that serves as a backbone for the world's cellular carriers to interconnect, allowing seamless routing of calls, text messages, and other services across borders. However, as the countdown to the conference kicks off, concerns are mounting over reports of potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by security services, creating a potentially massive cyber-threat that might compromise user privacy and global communication. The SS7 System: An Overview The Signaling System 7 (SS7) traces its roots back to the 1970s and continues to dominate the telecommunication landscape owing to its efficiency and reliability. It is a set of telephony protocols that enable cellular networks to interconnect and enable functions such as call routing, SMS delivery, and billing. Furthermore, the SS7 system allows varied networks to maintain compatibility and exchange data, irrespective of their geographic location or carrier type. Flaws in the SS7 System During the hacker conference scheduled in Hamburg, several flaws in the SS7 system are set to be unveiled, serving as a wake-up call to telecom companies and cellular carriers. Some of the most significant flaws are: 1. Lack of encryption: The SS7 system was designed before the advent of modern encryption techniques, rendering it vulnerable to cyber-attacks and easy interception. This lack of security could enable malicious intruders to infiltrate the system and target confidential information. 2. Unauthorized access: Since the SS7 system allows different networks to interconnect, cybercriminals could exploit this feature by infiltrating one network and using it as an access point to penetrate other connected networks. This unauthorized access exposes vital user information, calls, and messages to significant risks. 3. Location tracking: The SS7 system also enables the accurate tracking of communication-enabled devices. This location tracking feature can be easily misused by hackers or security services to monitor the movement and whereabouts of individuals, thereby violating user privacy and promoting surveillance purposes. 4. Call and message interception: One of the most alarming flaws in the SS7 system is the possibility of intercepting phone calls, text messages, and metadata. Cybercriminals or malicious entities could exploit this vulnerability to gather sensitive information, eavesdrop on private conversations, and even alter the communication to create confusion or chaos. Potential Exploitation by Security Services In addition to these vulnerabilities that threaten user privacy and global communication, reports suggest that the flaws in the SS7 system could also fall into the hands of security services. In doing so, these agencies would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities for intelligence gathering, mass surveillance, and cyber warfare. The fact that these flaws remain unaddressed gives rise to concerns that perhaps the security services have been using these weaknesses to their advantage, undermining user trust and posing severe ethical questions. Conclusion The hacker conference in Hamburg is a timely reminder that the age-old SS7 system is in dire need of an upgrade, as its flaws pose a significant threat to user privacy, global communication, and overall security. With the vulnerabilities set to be reported at the conference, it is hoped that these revelations compel cellular carriers and telecom companies to prioritize amending these issues. Strengthening the SS7 system from cybercriminals and potential exploitation by security services is essential to ensure safe, secure, and reliable communication for all in today's interconnected world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Alas poor Hermann, but he wasn't the only one to disappear without trace at Troon's storied par three. Twenty-seven years before Hermann, Gene Sarazen's chances went south when he took five and lost the Claret Jug by one to Arthur Havers. And 74 years after Sarazen, a young superstar was going nicely in the final round of the Open when he fetched-up at the famous par three. Six shots later, Tiger Woods' challenge was done. Designed by Willie Fernie, the Open champion of 1883, given its name by Willie Park Jnr, the Open champion of 1887 and 1889 and refined by James Braid, five-time Open champion between 1901 and 1910, the Postage Stamp is in the pantheon of great par threes. History? It's all around you out there on the patch of land that is about to host the 145th Open. The tee-box at the top of a dune, a long and narrow green carved out of sand hills. Standing guard, like malevolent sentries, five cavernous bunkers that spell trouble, at best, and death, at worst. Hit it high and the wind might kill it. Hit it low and it's tough to stop it. Hit it short or right or left and you're not quite in Hermann country but you're in a bad place, a circle of hell for some. Talk to a few of golf's best thinkers and many of them smile when the Postage Stamp is mentioned. To them, it's not just a golf hole, it's more than that. It's the way golf should be. We now live in an age where major championship par threes can push on for 300 yards long, and where the game's only answer to technology is to make courses ever longer, ever more brutal. \\"We're losing that skill element in golf,\\" says Paul McGinley. \\"The Postage Stamp is great architecture. It's not about distance, it's about course management, it's about shaping a shot, it's about touch and feel.\\" Thomas Bjorn is of a like mind. \\"It shows that this game doesn't have to be controlled by the equipment,\\" he said. \\"It's not about what's long, it's about what's really well designed.\\" In 2014, BBC Scotland asked 20 top players - who'd won a combined 11 Claret Jugs and almost 400 tournaments worldwide - to name their favourite Open championship hole. It came down to two - the Postage Stamp at Troon and the Road Hole at St Andrews were locked together on six votes each. Rory McIlroy, Ian Poulter, Nicolas Colsaerts, Louis Oosthuizen, Sam Torrance and Stephen Gallacher went with the Road Hole. Ernie Els, Luke Donald, Paul Casey, Paul McGinley, David Howell and Darren Clarke went with the Postage Stamp. The casting vote went to Phil Mickelson. The American went for the par three. \\"Challenging a player for his precision as opposed to solely length is a lost art,\\" said Mickelson at Castle Stuart earlier in the week. \\"The Postage Stamp is a perfect example of how you can challenge the best players in the world. I would love to see that implemented more.\\" The Postage Stage demands accuracy over length, brain over brawn. It's a tease, a siren with a touch of the devil. In dead calm, it's a birdie hole. In the wind - different story. \\"It was a little dinky eight-iron for me when I played it last week,\\" says Henrik Stenson. \\"Most of the good par 3s in golf are probably ranging between 123 to maybe 180. I'm not a big fan of the new four-iron or three-iron par threes. \\"Of these little ones, the 17th at Sawgrass, the Postage Stamp - you hit a good shot, you make two, you hit a bad one you can walk away with a five. You can have a three-shot swing on a pitching wedge. If you're the kind of fan that wants to see carnage I can highly recommend going out to that eighth hole and sitting in that grandstand on a difficult day.\\" \\"There's going to be carnage,\\" says Graeme McDowell. \\"If the wind blows in the direction I was playing it in last week you're going to have all kinds of numbers. The bunker pin-high right is unplayable. I hit six-iron. The next day I hit eight. It's a very changeable golf hole.\\" Colin Montgomerie spoke about the outward seven holes at Troon and the feeling he gets when he plays them. All relatively downwind, all fairly straightforward. \\"I think, 'OK, I can do this, I can plot my way around here',\\" says Montgomerie. \\"And then you get to the eighth hole and it's the first one that turns into the wind. \\"Even in a practice round you stand up there and it's a potential card-wrecker. Always was and always will be. It does bring to mind the great par threes in the world of golf - Pebble Beach's seventh, the 12th at Augusta, and the eighth at Royal Troon and they're all short holes. \\"It's amazing how one can design a course back in the 1870s and it still stands the test of time today. Fantastic. Nearly 150 years old and it can still generate excitement and drama.\\" McGinley uses the Postage Stamp as an example of not just what a great golf hole should be but as an illustration of how far golf is getting away from artistry. \\"It's just brilliant and it shows that if you get clever green designs and just a bit of thought then you don't need massive length to challenge players. \\"The wind at the Postage Stamp is a big factor, you have a very small target and the margin for error is tiny. You don't have to be far off line for it to be trouble. You have seven or eight yards of width to hit it into. \\"I like watching the ball as it hits the green because that tells you what shape you've put on the shot. Normally it plays a little bit into the wind, in off the right. You need to hold the shot in there, which is a difficult skill with a loft on the club. With loft, it's easier to hook the ball but a lot harder to hold it. That's what creates the skill level. \\"We're losing that skill from the game, absolutely. Firm and fast fairways and greens call for course management and short par threes do the same. We're not seeing course management much any more. \\"The Postage Stamp is all about course management and ball control. It's about who can hold it in that wind, who can play it the right way and create the right spin on the ball so that when it hits the green, it stops. If you get it right, great. If you get it wrong, watch out.\\" There is another way of playing it, of course. Sarazen was 71 years old when he arrived at Troon for the 1973 Open, the 50th time he'd competed for the Claret Jug. In his opening round, he punched a five-iron on to the green at the Postage Stamp and it rolled all the way into the hole for an ace. The day after, the great man found sand off the tee, then promptly holed his bunker shot for a birdie. Sarazen's heroics add to the legend of the hole. Its majesty and danger have long since been written into the folklore of the game. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The Postage Stamp, Troon's famous par three, is known for its challenging course and its focus on precision over length. The course was designed by Willie Fernie, the Open champion of 1883, Willie Park, Jr., the Open champion of 1887 and 1889, and James Braid, a five-time Open champion between 1901 and 1910. Despite its short length and the number of years since its creation, the Postage Stamp continues to generate excitement and drama, showcasing the importance of course management, touch, and feel in the game of golf."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The kidneys receive blood through the renal artery - The blood is passed through the nephrons in the kidneys - The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person goes through dialysis happens, how will it affect the body is unable to filter urine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"When a person undergoes dialysis, the process of filtering waste from the blood is artificially carried out by the dialysis machine instead of the kidneys. The perturbation hypothesis in this case is that the body is unable to filter urine because the kidneys are not functioning properly. This is why dialysis is needed: to take over the role of the kidneys in filtering out waste and excess water from the blood. Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis Suppose the person goes through dialysis and their body is unable to filter urine. This suggests that the kidneys are not functioning effectively, and the process of filtering waste from the blood is compromised. Step 2: Identify the changes to the process In this situation, the process of filtering waste from the blood is altered. Instead of the kidneys receiving blood through the renal artery and filtering waste through the nephrons, the blood is now passed through the dialysis machine. Step 3: Analyze the effects of the perturbation on the process The direct effect of the perturbation is that the kidneys are unable to filter waste and excess water effectively. This could lead to a buildup of toxins and water in the body, causing health problems and discomfort. Step 4: Identify the intervention (dialysis) Dialysis is introduced as an intervention to perform the function of the kidneys. Blood is circulated through a dialysis machine, which filters out the waste and excess water, returning clean blood to the body. Step 5: Evaluate the impact of the intervention By performing the role of the kidney, the dialysis machine effectively mitigates the impact of the perturbation. The process of filtering waste and excess water from the blood is not fully hindered, though it is more dependent on an external procedure. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the kidneys being unable to filter urine does have direct effects on the body's waste filtration process. In response to this perturbation, dialysis can be used to filter waste and excess water from the blood artificially. Dialysis helps maintain the normal function of blood filtration, though it introduces dependency on an external procedure. The perturbation hypothesis influences the process, but the intervention of dialysis mitigates its impact."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death? is inside the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down. He tells Lola that unless he raises 100,000 marks to give Ronnie within 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarketâwhich for several obvious reasons is unwise. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to find the money.

The fact that Justine named her daughter Alma after Alma Mahler, Gustav's wife, indicates a reference to the connection between the two families, which could imply some sort of admiration or affection for her brother's wife. However, this fact alone cannot establish the presence of a positive or negative relationship between Justine and her brother Gustav. To determine the nature of their relationship, it would be necessary to examine additional information such as personal letters, biographies, and historical accounts of their interactions.

Gustav Mahler was a prominent composer and conductor, and his accomplishments could have had varying impacts on his relationship with his sister. It's also important to note that personal relationships within families can be significantly influenced by factors such as family dynamics, shared experiences, and individual personalities.

A:","completion":"Yes, \\"scare people into following his specific laws\\" is a valid answer, but it is important to explore it in depth to understand the various facets of Alex's motives and the implications of his actions on the people he governed. Alex's choice to govern every person with an iron fist and establish an irrational justice system can be attributed to multiple factors that may have contributed to the development and maintenance of such a regime. Here are some possible reasons for why Alex chose this approach: 1. Centralization of Power: Alex might have sought to maintain absolute control over the governance and decision-making processes. By creating a climate of fear, he sought to eliminate any potential challenges to his authority and guarantee obedient compliance from the populace. 2. Psychological Warfare: By instilling fear among his subjects, Alex could exploit the psychological impact of his rule and create a sense of helplessness among the citizenry. This way, people would unlikely rise up against him, as they would perceive the consequences to be far too dire. 3. Elimination of Opposition: Alex could have been concerned about the influence of different factions, ideologies, or belief systems that may have threatened the stability of his rule. By establishing an irrational justice system, he could arbitrarily target any group or individual that he saw as a potential opponent, thereby solidifying his position of power. 4. Control of Resources: Alex’s tight grip on power might have stemmed from a desire to control the distribution of resources among the population. By employing fear tactics, he effectively prevented people from banding together and demanding a fairer distribution of resources, allowing him to maintain control over valuable assets. 5. Propagation of Ideology: Alex might have believed that propagating his specific values, beliefs, and laws was paramount to the successful continuation of his rule. By controlling the justice system and ensuring that transgressors faced harsh consequences, he sought to create a society founded on his principles. 6. Legacy and Ego: Alex's desire to leave a lasting imprint on history could have driven him to extreme measures. Controlling the population through fear and embedding his ideologies in their lives would ensure that his legacy would persist long after his reign. 7. Insecurity: Alex might have felt insecure about his ability to lead effectively or fear being dethroned by another contender. To mitigate these insecurities, he used fear tactics to suppress any threats to his rule. While the answer \\"scare people into following his specific laws\\" is indeed valid, understanding the diverse and complicated reasons behind Alex's actions helps to create a more comprehensive picture of his motivations for employing an iron fist and an irrational justice system in his governance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education. Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul. After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples. In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII. Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining. After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia. The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel. Answer this question: What happened second: Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous or the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan?","completion":"The second thing that happened was Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous. This happened after German missionaries were expelled in 1914. The first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan in 1892."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How do you do this: How do I cut the wood for a hexagon display shelf?","completion":"To cut the wood for a hexagon display shelf, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: - Wood planks (preferably a hardwood for durability) - Measuring tape or ruler - Pencil - Miter saw or hand saw with a miter box - Sandpaper - Wood glue - Clamps - Wood finish (optional) 2. Determine the size of your hexagon shelf: Decide on the length of the sides for your hexagon shelf. Keep in mind that all sides should be equal in length. 3. Measure and mark the wood planks: Using the measuring tape or ruler, measure and mark the length of the sides on the wood planks. 4. Set the miter saw to 30° angle: A hexagon requires 6 sides with 120° angles on the inside. To achieve this, you need to cut each side at a 30° angle. Set the miter saw to a 30° angle or use the miter box for a hand saw to make precise cuts. 5. Cut the wood planks: Carefully line up the wood on the miter saw or in the miter box, ensuring your pencil marks are visible and aligned with the saw blade. Cut the wood planks at the marked points. Repeat this process for all 6 sides. 6. Sand the edges: Use sandpaper to smooth out the edges of each cut plank. 7. Dry-fit the hexagon: Before attaching the planks, arrange them on a flat surface to form the hexagon shape. Make sure all the angles and corners are aligned and fit properly. 8. Assemble the hexagon shelf: Apply wood glue along the edges of the wood planks. Press the planks together and hold them in place using clamps while the glue dries. Allow the glue to dry for the recommended time according to the manufacturer's instructions. 9. Strengthen the joints (optional): To ensure a stronger shelf, you can reinforce the joints with dowels, screws or with a biscuit joiner. This step is optional but recommended. 10. Apply the finish: Once the glue is dry and the hexagon shelf is assembled, you can apply the wood finish of your choice. This could be paint, stain, or a clear protective finish. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper application and allow it to dry completely before mounting or using your hexagon shelf. Remember, always use appropriate safety gear and take necessary precautions while working with saws and other tools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The freedom to move is a human right. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"The claim that the freedom to move is a human right can be supported by various sources of evidence: international human rights law, philosophical arguments, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits. 1. International Human Rights Law: The right to freedom of movement is enshrined in multiple international human rights documents. These include Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that \\"everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state\\" and the right to leave and return to one's country. Additionally, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to liberty of movement and the associated freedoms of choosing residence, leaving any country, and returning to one's own country. Such legal provisions emphasize the importance of the freedom to move as an inherent human right. 2. Philosophical Arguments: The philosophical foundation for the right to freedom of movement can be found in the works of various philosophers. For example, John Locke, in his \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" argued that individuals have a natural right to life, liberty, and property. Freedom of movement is a crucial component of liberty, allowing people to pursue opportunities, escape oppression, and develop relationships with others. Immanuel Kant also maintained that human beings possess inherent dignity, autonomy, and rationality, which entitle them to certain rights, including freedom of movement. 3. Historical Developments: Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of individuals and groups advocating for the right to freedom of movement. This evolution can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, where limited forms of freedom of movement were recognized for certain citizens. The abolition of slavery and the end of apartheid in South Africa are other significant examples where the freedom of movement was recognized as a fundamental human right. Furthermore, the establishment of the European Union and the Schengen Agreement, which allow free movement between member countries, demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the right to move freely. 4. Socio-Economic Benefits: The freedom to move has numerous socio-economic benefits that support its claim as a human right. Migrants can contribute significantly to the economies of both their host and home countries, promoting cultural exchange, fostering innovation, and enhancing the overall well-being of societies. Moreover, the freedom to move enables people to escape poverty and persecution, thereby enhancing their quality of life and helping to reduce global inequalities. In this sense, freedom of movement not only aligns with humanitarian goals but also promotes social and economic development on a global scale. In summary, the argument that the freedom to move is a human right is supported by various types of evidence. The international human rights law, philosophical underpinnings, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits all contribute to the recognition of the right to move as integral to human dignity, autonomy, and well-being."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Some friends have many candies, and some have very few. Now, the person in charge of sharing the candies (let's call them the State Legislature) wants to make sure that the friends with few candies get some extra help.

The idea here is to make sure they can continue lending a hand and that they're not worried about their own candies. Now, there's another idea: \\"The State Legislature should focus more on the rich friends.\\" This idea is about giving more attention to friends who already have a bunch of candies. This idea is different from the first one, because the first one (loan forgiveness for certain helpers) is about giving more help to friends with few candies.

(CNN) -- A couple weeks after attending his first United Nations General Assembly meeting as president, Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What a difference three years makes. Back in his first months in office, simply being Barack Obama was enough to bring cheering crowds into the street. Whether it was because he was not George Bush or because he was promising to end American policies that were widely despised or whether it was because -- as the first African-American to be elected U.S. president, he embodied an ideal of opportunity for all that was core to this country's appeal -- it hardly mattered. Convene a crowd, and they would find something to like about Barack Obama. Back then, he seized the moment with great speeches that offered a vision for a new era in American leadership. In Cairo, he spoke of new relations with the Islamic world. In Prague, he spoke of eliminating nuclear weapons. He embraced the G-20 as a mechanism of coordinating the response to the global economic crisis. He didn't bully. He charmed. Indeed, Obama is probably the first person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize largely for his charm. Or, alternatively, he may be the first person ever to have won the Nobel Peace Prize for the simple achievement of not having been the guy who had the job before him.

It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. PostScript. Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a counterpart to his TeX typesetting system. - LaTeX (, also pronounced as , a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to formatted text, as in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italic), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX. - WYSIWYG is an acronym for \\"what you see is what you get\\". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. - BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references . The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system . Within the typesetting system , its name is styled as ( mathrm ( B ( scriptstyle ( IB ) ) ! T ! -- ( displaystyle E ) ! X ) ) . The name is a portmanteau of the abbreviation of \`\` bibliography '' and TeX . BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner , by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information , similarly to the separation of content and presentation / style supported by LaTeX itself . - TeX (or , see below) is a typesetting system (or \\"formatting system\\") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time. TeX is free software, which has made it more accessible to a wider range of users. - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. - Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","completion":"[A]. no. The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for an explanation on how to play Orbiter Space Flight Simulator, while the second question addresses the rarity and expensiveness of travel to low earth orbit after 50 years of manned space flight. Below are detailed answers for both questions: 1. How do I play Orbiter Space Flight Simulator? Orbiter is a free space flight simulator that allows you to explore the solar system in realistic spacecraft. To play the game, you'll need to first download and install it on your computer. Follow these steps to get started: Step 1: Download and Install Orbiter Go to the official Orbiter website (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) and download the simulator. It is available for Windows operating systems. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with Orbiter Controls and Interface Launch the Orbiter application and familiarize yourself with the interface. You will see a 3D view of the Earth, as well as a range of controls and menus that allow you to configure your spacecraft, select different views, and access other options. Take some time to explore the interface and read the documentation provided with the game to learn about the various features and settings. Step 3: Choose a Spacecraft and Starting Scenario From the main menu, you can select a spacecraft and a starting scenario. Scenarios range from simple orbital flights to complex interplanetary missions. Select a scenario that matches your experience level and interests. Step 4: Launch and Control Your Spacecraft Once you've chosen a scenario, the simulator will place your spacecraft in the starting position. Use your keyboard, mouse, or joystick (depending on your preference and setup) to control your spacecraft's orientation, engines, and systems. Step 5: Follow the Mission Objectives As you progress through your flight, you will have a set of mission objectives to complete. These can include orbiting the Earth, docking with a space station, or landing on a celestial body. Follow these objectives and use the controls and instruments at your disposal to successfully navigate and complete your mission. Step 6: Practice and Experiment It's important to practice and experiment with different scenarios and spacecraft to become proficient at the game. The more you play, the more you will learn about orbital mechanics, spacecraft systems, and the intricacies of space flight. 2. Why is it that after more than 50 years of manned space flight, travel to low earth orbit is still so rare and expensive? There are several reasons for the rarity and high cost of manned space flight to low earth orbit: Cost: The expense of building, launching, and maintaining a spacecraft capable of manned spaceflight remains very high. The cost of fuel and materials, as well as the specialized workforce required for developing and operating a spacecraft, contributes to the overall expense. Technology: Building a spacecraft capable of safely carrying humans to low earth orbit requires advanced technology and stringent safety measures. Ensuring a reliable and safe vehicle for manned missions adds complexity and drives up costs. Access to space: Governments and space agencies tightly control access to space. The infrastructure for space launches is limited to a few places globally, and the services are mainly reserved for military, scientific, and commercial purposes. Risk: Manned space flight carries inherent risks, including the potential for accidents or failures. These risks necessitate extensive testing, training, and safety measures, which adds to the overall cost. Demand: The demand for manned spaceflight is relatively low. The market has so far focused primarily on satellite launches and scientific or military missions. The recent development of commercial space travel, led by companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, is beginning to reshape the landscape, but it's still in the early stages. Despite these challenges, efforts to lower the cost of access to space and increase the frequency of manned space flight continue. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are developing reusable spacecraft to bring down costs and make space travel more accessible. As progress continues, it's possible we will see an increase in manned low earth orbit flight opportunities in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who declared amnesty on 11 October? from the following article ? The 1740 Batavia massacre (Dutch: Chinezenmoord, literally \\"Murder of the Chinese\\"; Indonesian: Geger Pacinan, meaning \\"Chinatown Tumult\\") was a pogrom in which Dutch East Indies soldiers and native collaborators killed ethnic Chinese residents of the port city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence in the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived. In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar River and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area. The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible...

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - A preseason fan favorite is reportedly headed to Philadelphia. The Eagles signed Saints running back Boston Scott to their active roster, according to Ian Rapaport of the NFL Network. The Saints selected Scott in the sixth round of the 2018 draft. He's spent the season on the Saints' practice squad. Hypothesis: Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints.","completion":"Drawing from the provided context, it is reasonable to formulate the hypothesis that Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints. The supporting evidence for this hypothesis can be found in various elements of the context: 1. Boston Scott's history with the Saints: As per the given information, Scott was selected by the Saints in the sixth round of the 2018 draft. This means that he was a fairly recent addition to the team, and more specifically, a part of their player lineup since the 2018 draft. 2. Practice squad participation: The text mentions that Scott spent the season on the Saints' practice squad. A practice squad is essentially a group of players who are part of a team but not part of the active roster, meaning they do not usually play in official games. Instead, they practice with the team, helping prepare them for upcoming matches by simulating the roles of opposing players. This aspect is a strong indication that Scott did not play in any NFL games this season for the Saints, as practice squad players generally do not take part in official games. 3. Signing with the Eagles: Following his stint with the Saints' practice squad, Scott was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to their active roster. This piece of information signifies a change in Scott's status, moving from the practice squad of the Saints to the active roster of the Eagles. An important implication of this change is that his previous role as part of the practice squad most likely did not involve participating in official games for the Saints this season. Combining these factors, it is rational to draw the hypothesis that Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints. His involvement in the practice squad rather than the active roster, coupled with his departure to become an active player for the Eagles, suggests that his role during the season was primarily centered around practice and not official game participation. Although the context does not explicitly state that Scott did not play any games for the Saints, this hypothesis is consistent with and strongly supported by the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv. Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you spread things out? Select from the following. 1). scatter them everywhere. 2). keep them in one spot.","completion":"Spreading things out can be done for a variety of reasons, for the sake of organization, to have a better perspective on all items, to improve space utilization, or when you're looking for something particular among many items. Let's explore both options you've provided and think about some detailed scenarios within each: Option 1: Scatter Them Everywhere This approach is all about spreading objects loosely and casually throughout a given area. There are many ways to scatter things practically, especially if we're talking about vast physical or digital spaces. Here are a few points to consider: - Consider what you're spreading: If these are physical objects, ensure that they won't get damaged or cause harm to someone. If these are digital files or data, ensure they are backed up and not in danger of being lost or misplaced. - Define your space: It's essential to consciously decide where objects will be scattered, whether it be a room or a digital hard drive. This helps keep the process manageable. - Casual scattering: Especially pertinent when aiming for an aesthetic flair, scattering things naturally and casually can create an appealing visual look. - Purposeful scattering: This involves a more careful placement, trying to intermix different types of objects for variety or to instill a sense of randomness. - Remember where everything is: When scattering things, ensure you have a rough idea of where things are. It may be useful to document placements especially for essential or valuable items. Option 2: Keep Them In One Spot Keeping things in one spot pertinently suggests a state of organization and preservation. These things may be physically tangible or digitally intangible. Here are some methods: - Sort and Organize: Keep things that are similar together. This will help you find them later and it’s easier to remember where things are if they are grouped. - Use Containers: If you're dealing with small physical goods, a box or basket is a great way to keep all the items together. For digital files, you can create a special folder. - Label Everything: If you have lots of things, it's easy to forget where you kept each item. Labeling each item or groups of items can help you remember and find them later. - Regular Maintenance & Updates: Keeping things in the same spot doesn't mean just dumping them there. Regular review of what's there, updating the labels, and removing obsolete or unnecessary items can help to keep everything in order. - Order Based On Frequency of Use: Place the items you use most often at the front or on top, so they're easy to access right away. - Protect Your Items: Keep them in one spot also means to store the objects in a safe, appropriate environment. Things should be stored in conditions that prevent any damage or loss. There isn't a correct answer between the two options you provided. Both ways have their advantages and the ideal method would heavily depend on the context, the nature of the items, the available space, and the intended goal you have in mind when managing those items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Certainly! The given sentence in German, \\"Beispielsweise hätte dieser Vorschlag früher vorgelegt werden müssen,\\" translates to English as: \\"For example, this proposal should have been submitted earlier.\\" Let's break down the translation: - \\"Beispielsweise\\" means \\"for example\\" or \\"for instance.\\" It is an adverb that is commonly used to provide an example or a specific instance of a more general idea or concept. - \\"hätte\\" is a conjugation of the German auxiliary verb \\"haben\\" (to have) in the subjunctive mood. In this case, it is being used to express a hypothetical situation, an action that should have happened, or a missed opportunity. - \\"dieser Vorschlag\\" translates to \\"this proposal\\" in English. \\"Dieser\\" is a demonstrative pronoun that agrees with the gender and case of the noun it's connected with. In this case, \\"Vorschlag\\" is a masculine noun in the nominative case, so \\"dieser\\" is used. - \\"früher\\" means \\"earlier\\" or \\"before.\\" It is an adverb that indicates that the action should have taken place at an earlier point in time. - \\"vorgelegt\\" is the past participle of the German verb \\"vorlegen\\" (to submit, present, or submit for consideration), which conveys the act of presenting or submitting a document or proposal. - \\"werden müssen\\" is a combination of \\"werden\\" (a modal verb used to form the passive voice) and \\"müssen\\" (a modal verb meaning \\"must\\" or \\"to have to\\"), indicating an obligation or necessity to perform the action expressed by the main verb in the sentence.

They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the authorities, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, whom he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police. After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Town,\\" Jem (James Coughlin) did not throw away any specific opportunity for a life of crime. Instead, it is Doug MacRay, one of Jem's lifelong friends and fellow bank robber, who had the chance to be a professional hockey player but chose a life of crime instead, following in his father's footsteps. Doug develops a romantic relationship with Claire Keesey, the bank manager they once took hostage. As their relationship progresses, Doug shares his regrets about not pursuing a hockey career and getting involved in criminal activities. Doug's decision not only led him to a life of crime but also put him in a difficult position when he discovers Claire can identify Jem by his tattoo, potentially leading the whole gang to jail. Doug aims to protect Claire from Jem by persuading her not to report her knowledge to the authorities. Additionally, Doug enlists Jem's help to deal with a local thug harassing Claire, further complicating the situation as Jem is unaware of Doug's true motives regarding Claire. Through a series of events, including more robberies, interrogations, and involvement with a local crime lord, Doug eventually reveals his plan to leave Boston and go to Florida while also trying to take Claire away from the dangerous situation they find themselves in. As a result, Doug's life of crime not only costs him his dream of being a professional athlete but also puts the lives of himself and those around him, such as Claire, in perpetual danger. In conclusion, it is important to note that it was Doug MacRay, not Jem Coughlin, who threw away an opportunity (in this case, a professional hockey career) for a life of crime.

Tästä syystä olemme siis pyytäneet komissiota tekemään ehdotuksen Euroopan laajuiseksi verkko-uhkapelien sääntelypuitteiksi jo viime vuonna. Haluamme varmistaa, että verkko-uhkapelien markkinat ovat avoimet, reilut ja puolueettomat kaikille jäsenmaille ja niiden kansalaisille, samalla suojellen kuluttajia ja estäen mahdolliset väärinkäytökset. Tavoitteena on luoda yhteiset säännöt ja standardit verkko-uhkapelien alalle yhdenmukaisen Euroopan laajuisen lähestymistavan mukaisesti. Näin voimme taata eri jäsenvaltioiden lakisääteisten rajoitusten ja kansallisten käytäntöjen yhteensopivuuden, samalla kun varmistamme kuluttajien ja uhkapelien tarjoajien suojelemisen. Verkko-uhkapelien sääntelypuitteiden toteuttamisessa Euroopan laajuisesti on olennaista ottaa huomioon myös eri jäsenvaltioiden kulttuuri- ja sosiaalipoliittiset näkökohdat. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi sitä, että jokaisen maan on voitava määrätä omista peliensä sosiaalisista, kulttuurillisista, taloudellisista ja muiden politiikanalojen päämääristä. Lopullisen sääntelykehyksen on kuitenkin oltava avoin ja joustava, jotta erilaisten uhkapelien tarjoajat voivat kilpailla oikeudenmukaisesti Euroopan laajuisilla markkinoilla. Tämä edistää innovaatiota ja parhaiden käytäntöjen jakamista alalla, ja auttaa näin lopulta kuluttajia hyödyntämään entistä laajempaa ja turvallisempaa uhkapelitarjontaa. Komission esittämän Euroopan laajuisen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelykehyksen tulee mahdollistaa yhdenmukaisen lainsäädännön kehittäminen kaikissa jäsenvaltioissa. Sen tulee myös seurata ja valvoa uhkapelien tarjoajien toimintaa, jotta voidaan estää petoksia, rahanpesua sekä muita laittomia toimintoja ja samalla turvata kuluttajien oikeudet ja tarjota heille turvallinen peliympäristö. Ehdotuksen mukaan Euroopan laajuinen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelykehyksen tulisi sisältää useita tärkeitä osa-alueita, kuten yhtenäisten pelilisenssien myöntämisen, kuluttajansuojan parantamisen, petostentorjunnan ja yleisen valvonnan, uhkapelien markkinointiin liittyvien säännösten ja rajoitusten kehittämisen sekä vastuullisen pelaamisen edistämisen ja tuen tarjoamisen ongelmapelaajille. Näiden toimenpiteiden avulla voimme luoda tehokkaan ja oikeudenmukaisen Euroopan laajuisen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelyjärjestelmän, joka hyödyttää sekä jäsenvaltioita että niiden kansalaisia ja edistää samalla koko Euroopan talouden ja digitaalisen sisämarkkinoiden vahvistumista."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No usual answers on Labor Day 2016 Every four years, Labor Day means more than just the end of summer: it’s also the end of high uncertainty in a presidential election, and the time when candidates start to see their real chances. Or at least that’s what it used to mean. The surrealism of 2016 – a former secretary of state, who ran eight years ago and is married to a former president who was almost impeached, running against a reality TV show celebrity with a mediocre business record and alleged history of sexual harassment – has finally started to ebb. Voters will have the two least popular presidential candidates in decades on their ballots, and there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how that unpopularity will affect their decisions. One number holds many clues about how we ended up here: 42%. That’s the share of Americans who identify as independent, according to Gallup’s most recent analysis. That number is the highest Gallup has ever seen since it started measuring political inclination in 1988, and it’s considerably higher than the share who now identify as Democrats (29%) or Republicans (26%). Understanding independents is key to understanding how Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump became hugely popular. Independents are also crucial for understanding how Hillary Clinton’s support might be overstated in current polls. Currently, Clinton is the most likely candidate to win the 2016 presidential election, according to analysts who rely on polls. At the time of writing, the New York Times projects that she has a 86% chance of winning in November, and FiveThirtyEight puts her chances at 69%. But these probabilities don’t take into account the fact that polls have become plagued by systemic issues, from low response rates to media biases, that have made them sometimes unreliable. What’s more, in polling (much like every other type of human interaction), it’s hard to tell whether people mean what they say. Are Trump supporters reluctant to share their views when a stranger from Ipsos, Rasmussen or Gallup calls them up? If so, Clinton could be in trouble. Forecasting the political future means considering not one probability but many possibilities. Here are the three most likely outcomes in this election. Over the past 20 years, there are just 19 states that have flipped between the two main parties at least once. Of those, around two-thirds are likely to be closely fought contests this year: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. Clinton’s hopes rest on voters choosing her and those who might vote Trump staying home. Clinton’s rhetoric in the coming months will be important for securing these victories. The former secretary of state needs to convince former Bernie Sanders supporters that she shares the values that galvanized so many young voters. Similarly, Clinton needs to persuade voters that she is the only way Americans can keep Donald Trump out of the White House. Like Clinton, Trump needs to focus his energies on mobilizing supporters to actually go to the polls. Although demographics don’t seem to work in his favor (his supporters make up a relatively small fraction of the overall electorate) it is quite possible that Trump’s support is understated in polls. Polling analysis appears to privilege left-of-centre ideas (and many of the journalists who interpret polls, including this journalist, may be viewing the numbers with a misplaced optimism) which helps explains why forecasts about the British EU referendum, the Israeli election and the Scottish independence referendum were all off the mark. There’s another factor in this election which may well work in Trump’s favor: third party candidates. Between them, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein stand to pick up 11% of the national vote. Votes for Johnson and Stein appear more likely to erode Clinton’s vote share than Trump’s. Those third-party candidates have a slim chance of making it to the presidential debates (they need to be polling with at least 15% of the national electorate’s support to qualify), meaning Trump will want to sow what doubt and frustration he can in Democratic-leaning voters, in order to convince them to stay home or vote for a third party candidate. Sexism could also benefit Donald Trump. In a survey of more than 2,000 US adults in 2014, only 74% of women and 58% of men agreed that there are not enough women in positions of power. The mere fact this is a possibility shows just how much uncertainty there is around this election. And it is a real possibility, even though more than 20 years have passed since anyone won by a double-digit margin. For a start, the distribution of US electoral college votes privileges the Democratic party. Together, Democratic “safe” states (those that have voted Democratic consistently in the past six presidential elections) yield 242 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. States that Republicans can reliably count on have 102 electoral votes. As a Democrat and a seasoned politician, Clinton is the most likely candidate to represent continuity in the minds of many voters. Past elections have also shown that even after contemplating the different options, voters tend to revert towards the status quo in the final days before casting their ballot. Then again, this is no ordinary election. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the presidential election and how it's hard to know for sure who will win. It talks about how many people don't really like either of the main candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and that this makes it more uncertain. It also mentions that polls, which are like asking people who they will vote for, can sometimes be wrong. The article gives three possible paths for the election and discusses what could happen in each. Overall, it emphasizes that the outcome of this unusual election is not very clear, and we will have to wait and see who wins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose your answer from: [+] description [+] entity [+] abbreviation [+] human [+] numeric [+] location","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Why do some people have two different color eyes?\\" would be a description. This is because the answer entails an explanation detailing the underlying factors, biological processes, or genetic causes that give rise to the phenomenon of having two different colored eyes in some individuals. Heterochromia, as this condition is called, occurs for various reasons. It can be divided into three types: complete heterochromia, sectoral heterochromia, and central heterochromia. Complete heterochromia is a rare condition in which an individual has two completely different colored irises. This can be due to genetic factors or chromosomal abnormalities. For instance, a person might inherit genes for blue eyes from one parent and brown eyes from the other. This genetic variation could result in one blue eye and one brown eye. Sectoral heterochromia refers to the presence of two or more colors in a single iris. This can occur when the distribution of the pigment melanin is uneven in the eye, resulting in patchy areas of varied coloration in the iris. Central heterochromia, on the other hand, is characterized by an iris with a different color near the pupil compared to the rest of the iris. This can be attributed to the differences in the concentration and dispersion of the pigments that define eye color. In addition to genetic factors, there can also be acquired cases of heterochromia, which occur later in life due to injury, eye surgery, a medical condition, or the use of certain medications. Overall, the answer to this question is not an entity, abbreviation, human, location, or a numeric value. Instead, it provides an extensive description of the various factors, genetic processes, and potential causes behind the presence of two different colored eyes in some individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sent 2: The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. Sent 3: It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Sent 4: Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. Sent 5: The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. Sent 6: And beaches. Sent 7: Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. Sent 8: With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. Sent 9: The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Sent 10: Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. Sent 11: The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. Sent 12: In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Sent 13: Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Sent 14: Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sent 15: Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. Sent 16: But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. Sent 17: The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east.

Write highlights for this article: You don't find many churches making theatrical films. You especially don't find many churches making films starring Kirk Cameron about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn. Kirk Cameron stars in \\"Fireproof,\\" a film he was attracted to for its many themes, he said. But that's the case for Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. In fact, the film, \\"Fireproof,\\" was the church's third movie. It was also an unexpected hit. In September it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, eventually bringing in 33.5 million and spawning two books: a novelization, also called \\"Fireproof,\\" which is in The New York Times' best-seller list's Top 20; and a companion journal to the movie, \\"The Love Dare,\\" which has sold more than 2 million copies. Last week \\"Fireproof\\" debuted on DVD and climbed to No. 3 on Billboard's DVD chart, beating out \\"The Hulk\\" and \\"Saw V,\\" among others. \\"You don't often see movies made by churches do big numbers,\\" said Billboard's Anthony Colombo. \\"Having [distributor] Sony behind it helps. Having Kirk Cameron helps, but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [DVDs] in its first week is pretty impressive.\\" \\"It should not be working,\\" said Alex Kendrick, one of the pastors behind the film. \\"All I can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor God.\\" Kendrick said that Sherwood's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked God to give them an idea for their next movie. They were just coming off making \\"Facing the Giants,\\" a movie shot entirely in Albany on a 100,000 budget. It starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made 10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on DVD, launching the church into the national spotlight. The church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships. \\"Families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it,\\" said Kendrick, recalling the idea's genesis. \\"God give us the idea. We had no clue what would happen with it.\\" \\"Fireproof\\" began with a 500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member/actors, but the film got a left-field boost when Cameron, best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the TV series \\"Growing Pains,\\" read the script and asked to get involved. \\"All throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications, money, sex, addiction, porn, extramarital affairs, feeling respected at work but not at home, feeling respected by friends but not at home,\\" Cameron told CNN. The themes resonated with the actor and devout Christian, a husband of 17 years, and father of six, he said. That and the \\"cool action scenes,\\" he added. The makers of \\"Fireproof\\" tapped into the church market, arranging screenings for the National Baptist Pastors' convention before release and using word-of-mouth among church leaders. However, says Cameron, the film was pitched to general audiences, not necessarily Christians. \\"'Fireproof' was never marketed as a Christian movie. This is a movie about marriage,\\" Cameron said. \\"The fact is, though, the gospel is presented, is done well, and it's a central part of the storyline.\\" Although many critics panned \\"Fireproof\\" -- \\"as sincere, uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture,\\" said Variety -- audiences embraced it. \\"There's a huge market out there that's underserved. That market is there and a lot of people don't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market,\\" Cameron said. Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com, said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend. \\"With 'Fireproof,' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board,\\" he said. \\"They didn't follow traditional marketing methods but they didn't need them for this film. ... Maybe that's why it worked out so well.\\" He added, \\"You're talking about a very successful property. ... The powers that be that put this together are really on to something.\\" Churches are using \\"Love Dare\\" and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool, says publisher B&H Publishing's Andrea Dennis, who calls \\"Fireproof\\" \\"a marriage movement.\\" For Valentine's Day more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film, many displaying the admonition \\"Fireproof Your Marriage\\" on their signs. B&H believes \\"Love Dare\\" could hang around on the best-seller list -- where it's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of Rick Warren's \\"The Purpose Driven Life.\\" And the filmmakers have kept their success close to home. Alex Kendrick said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town, equipped with eight tennis courts, eight basketball courts and an equestrian area. A baseball diamond is on the way. He's confident \\"Fireproof\\" will remain a successful brand. \\"When something grows the only reason it happens is people say it worked and you should try it,\\" Kendrick said. \\"When it works and there's a legitimate impact, people want to be a part of it.\\"","completion":"Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia, surprised everyone with their unexpected hit film \\"Fireproof,\\" starring Kirk Cameron.

Ensure safety first: To ensure your own safety, wear protective gloves and goggles before handling the dead snake. Dead snakes can still have venomous fangs, and the possibility of getting scratched or bitten exists. 2. Gather necessary tools: You will need a clean chopping board and a large, clean, sharp, smooth knife. Make sure the knife is sharp to avoid the need for multiple chops and to minimize the chances of slip-ups. 3. Step by step instructions: a. Find a suitable area: Select an appropriate area to perform this task on the sidewalk. Ensure it is a flat, stable surface, and free of any potential hazards. b. Place the chopping board: Lay out the clean chopping board on the selected area. c. Prepare the snake: Using your protective gloves, hold the dead snake carefully, and stretch it out with its head facing upwards on the chopping board. Ensure the snake's head is lying firmly against the chopping board's surface. d. Chop the head: Hold the knife firmly with both hands while maintaining a secure grip. Position the knife above the snake's neck, just behind the head. With a swift and controlled motion, chop the head off the snake by bringing down the full force of the knife. Be sure to cut through the snake's spine and any muscle or tissue for a clean removal of the head. e. Dispose of the snakehead: Once the head is successfully removed, safely dispose of it by placing it in a sealed container or plastic bag. 4. Cleanup: Clean and sanitize all the tools and equipment used in the process, including the chopping board, knife, gloves, and goggles. Dispose of the snake's body properly, abiding by any local regulations on animal disposal. In contrast, Option II involves using a clean dull smooth large knife and a chalkboard as the surface. This method is not recommended because: 1. A dull knife requires more effort and multiple chops, raising the risk of accidents or injuries. 2. A chalkboard is not suitable for this task as it may break under the force of the chop, potentially causing shards to scatter and creating a hazardous environment. 3. Chalking boards are porous, meaning they can harbor bacteria or grime, leading to unsanitary conditions in the process. In conclusion, the best and safest method for accomplishing the goal of removing the head from a dead snake is Option I – using a clean, sharp, smooth large knife and a clean chopping board. Make sure to follow proper safety guidelines and dispose of the snake's head and body accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Korolev was born in Zhytomyr, Russian Empire. His father, Pavel Yakovlevich Korolev, was born in Mogilev to a clerk of the Imperial Russian Army and a peasant mother. His mother, Maria Nikolaevna Koroleva (Moskalenko/Bulanina), was a daughter of a wealthy merchant in the city of Nezhin with Cossack heritage. On his maternal side, in addition to Cossacks, he also had Greek and Polish ancestry. Korolev received vocational training in carpentry and in various academics at the Odessa Building Trades School (Stroyprofshkola No. 1). Enjoyment of a 1913 air show inspired interest in aeronautical engineering. Korolev began designing a glider as a diversion while studying for his graduation exams at the vocational school. He made an independent study of flight theory, and worked in the local glider club. A detachment of military seaplanes had been stationed in Odessa, and Korolev took a keen interest in their operations. In 1923 he joined the Society of Aviation and Aerial Navigation of Ukraine and the Crimea (OAVUK). He had his first flying lesson after joining the Odessa hydroplane squadron and had many opportunities to fly as a passenger. In 1924 he personally designed an OAVUK construction project glider called the K-5. He briefly trained in gymnastics until his academic work suffered from this distraction. Korolev hoped to attend the Zhukovsky Academy in Moscow, but his qualifications did not meet the academy's standards. He attended the Kiev Polytechnic Institute's aviation branch in 1924 while living with his uncle Yuri, and earning money to pay for his courses by performing odd jobs. His curriculum was technically oriented, and included various engineering, physics and mathematics classes. He met and became attracted to a classmate, Xenia Vincentini, who would later become his first wife. In 1925 he was accepted into a limited class on glider construction, and suffered two broken ribs flying the training glider they built. He continued courses at Kiev until he was accepted into the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MVTU, BMSTU) in July 1926. Korolev studied specialized aviation topics until 1929, while living with his family in the typically crowded conditions of Moscow. Korolev enjoyed opportunities to fly gliders and powered aircraft during this part of his education. He designed a glider in 1928, and flew it in a competition the next year. The Communist Party accelerated the education of engineers in 1929 to meet the country's urgent need for their skills. Korolev obtained a diploma by producing a practical aircraft design by the end of the year. His advisor was the famous Andrei Tupolev.","completion":"The text is about Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, a prominent rocket engineer and spacecraft designer in the Soviet Union during the 20th century.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In the north of Scotland there is a lake called Loch Ness. It is the biggest lake in Britain. It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help.

It is approximately in length, and it stretches east from the town of Vejle at its head to the towns of Trelde Næs on the south side and Juelsminde on the north side at the mouth. The fjord's generally calm surface waters are surrounded by low forested hills shaped by glaciers during the last ice age. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - In engineering, a truss is a structure that \\"consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object\\". A \\"two-force member\\" is a structural component where force is applied to only two points. Although this rigorous definition allows the members to have any shape connected in any stable configuration, trusses typically comprise five or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as nodes. In this typical context, external forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as is necessary for the links to be two-force members. - A box or tubular girder is a girder that forms an enclosed tube with multiple walls, rather than an or H-beam. Originally constructed of riveted wrought iron, they are now found in rolled or welded steel, aluminium extrusions or prestressed concrete. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Vejle is a town in Denmark, in the southeast of the Jutland Peninsula at the head of Vejle Fjord, where the Vejle River and Grejs River and their valleys converge. It is the site of the councils of Vejle Municipality (\\"kommune\\") and the Region of Southern Denmark. The city itself has a population of 54,862, making it the ninth largest city in Denmark. Vejle Municipality has a population of 111,743. The city is part of the Triangle Region, which includes the neighbouring cities of Kolding and Fredericia. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Falsework consists of temporary structures used in construction to support spanning or arched structures in order to hold the component in place until its construction is sufficiently advanced to support itself. This usage is specifically called centering. Falsework also includes temporary support structures for formwork used to mould concrete to form a desired shape, scaffolding to give workers access to the structure being constructed, and shoring which is temporary structural reinforcement used during repairs. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Structural steel is a category of steel used as a construction material for making structural steel shapes. A structural steel shape is a profile, formed with a specific cross section and following certain standards for chemical composition and mechanical properties. Structural steel shapes, sizes, composition, strengths, storage practices, etc., are regulated by standards in most industrialized countries. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Vejle Fjord Bridge ( Danish : Vejlefjordbroen ) is a cantilever bridge that spans Vejle Fjord between Mølholm and Nørremarken near the town of Vejle in Denmark . The bridge is 1712 metres long , the longest span is 110 metres , and the maximum clearance to the sea is 40 metres . The bridge has 15 spans . Vejle Fjord Bridge was built to lead traffic past the town of Vejle , where traffic congestion had become a problem in the 1970s . The building started in 1975 , and the bridge was opened on July 1 , 1980 . It cost 350 million kroner . The bridge now has more traffic than any other highway bridge in Denmark . - Prestressed concrete is a concrete construction material which is placed under compression prior to it supporting any applied loads (i.e. it is \\"pre\\" stressed). A more technical definition is \\"\\"Structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads.\\"\\" This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength \\"tendons\\" located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars, and are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fibre or aramid fibre. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations. Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved concrete performance can allow longer spans, reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings to be realised compared to reinforced concrete. Typical applications range through high-rise buildings, residential slabs, foundation systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom.

Stocks Jump; Insurers, Home Builders Help NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Tuesday, as battered insurers rose on confidence a probe of the industry would end quickly, helping blue chips snap a 5-day streak of losses. Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? OPTIONS: * World. * Sports. * Business. * Science/Tech.","completion":"This text is about \\"Business.\\" The excerpt provides insight into the surge in U.S. stocks, particularly focusing on the insurance industry and its potential implications on the wider market. It mentions that battered insurers experienced a rise in their share prices, as investors gained confidence in a rapid conclusion to an industry probe. This, in turn, helped blue-chip stocks recover from a 5-day losing streak. The business context is further reinforced by the mention of stock fluctuations, market sectors (insurers), and concepts such as investor confidence. These all pertain to the business and financial domain, providing a clear indication of the article's primary focus. Although the text does not offer specific details about the probe or the companies involved, it demonstrates how particular events or situations in the industry can have a broader impact on stock market performance. Despite the geographical scope of the article being the United States, the content does not correspond to any of the other possible options. It does not discuss any global events or issues that would make it fit into the 'World' category. Similarly, there is no mention of sports or athletic competitions, nor any scientific or technological breakthroughs or developments, which would warrant placing it into either the 'Sports' or the 'Science/Tech' categories. Overall, the content and focus of the text are closely related to the movement of stock prices, market confidence, and industry developments, situating it firmly in the realm of business reporting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Also, Time reports that the IRS fails to collect 150 billion a year in owed taxes, largely because its ancient computer system is too crude to catch frauds. Sentence 2: IRS have a top of the line computer system. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true at the same time, given that both sentences make contradictory statements about the IRS computer system. The first sentence states that the IRS fails to collect 150 billion a year in owed taxes, majorly due to its antiquated computer system, which is too primitive to effectively catch frauds. This implies that their computer system is outdated and inefficient at fulfilling its purpose, which is to collect due taxes and prevent tax fraud. The second sentence, however, states that the IRS has a top-of-the-line computer system. A top-of-the-line system refers to a system that is technologically advanced, cutting-edge, and highly efficient in its objectives. This is directly contradictory to the information provided by the first sentence. Thus, both sentences cannot be true simultaneously. If the first sentence is true, that would mean the IRS's computer system is outdated and unable to effectively catch frauds, so it cannot be considered a top-of-the-line system as claimed in the second sentence.

This sweat then moves up through the ducts and is released onto the surface of the skin. Once it is on the skin's surface, the sweat starts to evaporate (change from a liquid to a gas). The evaporation of sweat helps to remove excess heat from the body, as the process of evaporation requires energy (in the form of heat) to occur. When sweat evaporates, it absorbs heat from the skin and the surrounding air, which leads to a cooling effect on the body. This cooling effect helps to lower the body's temperature back down to a more normal range, around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). As the body's temperature decreases, the hypothalamus senses this change and stops sending messages to the sweat glands to produce more sweat. This feedback loop enables the body to maintain its normal temperature range and prevent overheating or heat-related illnesses. In summary, the final step of the process is the evaporation of sweat, which helps regulate the body's temperature back to a more normal range: around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - Sugar enters the body - Bloodstream - The pancreas - Insulin lower sugar levels - Bloo sugar goes back to normal.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of infected cells in the person's body can have an indirect effect on the process of regulating blood sugar levels. When the body is fighting off an infection, it often triggers an inflammatory response and the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can raise blood sugar levels. Additionally, illness can decrease the body's sensitivity to insulin, leading to a need for more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. In this situation, the body may require more insulin production or other forms of intervention to regulate blood sugar effectively, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

How does metal rust? Rust is what happens when some metals, like iron or steel, are exposed to water and air for a long time. It's a reaction between the metal, oxygen, and water which creates a reddish-brown substance called rust. Rust is not good for the metal because it weakens it, and that's why we often try to protect metals from rusting. 2. Is rust a metal? Rust is not a metal by itself, but it forms from metal when it reacts with oxygen and water. So, we can say that rust is related to metal, but it's actually a different substance that's created when metal gets in touch with air and water. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not the same. The first one is asking about how the rusting process happens, and the second one is asking if rust itself is a metal. So, they are talking about related things, but they are not the same question.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it “tells” the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range.

Information: - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart. - \`\` Alarm Call '' is a song by Björk released as the fourth single from her fourth studio album Homogenic , peaking at # 33 in the UK . The sped - up \`\` radio version '' of the song ( which was also featured in the video ) was used in the 1999 film The Mod Squad . - One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett. - Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Björk Guðmundsdóttir (born 21 November 1965), known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects. - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays).

I attend the symphony series, the chamber music series, and the ballet. I've enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there. The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient. I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards. This is a fun series. The seating is limited and on the stage, up close and personal with the artist. Prior to the performance, champagne and finger foods are served. The food is exquisite. After the performance, coffee and truffles or petit fours are served. It's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon. The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend. Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down, especially during intermissions. I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline. And then there is the Stage 5 Bar. I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip. I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail, the Black Russian. There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian. I've yet to try the food platters at Stage 5, although I have seen them. Meager portions. It seems, however, that they are always out of the one(s) I want. I am a contributor to KCPA and urge others to do likewise. This great venue brings in a wealth of fine entertainment one would only expect to find in big cities.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. A flipbook consists of a number of sheets of paper, usually bound at one edge, that creates the illusion of motion when you grasp the opposite edge with your thumb and flip through the pages. The more sheets of paper in the flipbook, the more realistic the motion appears to be. (A live-action motion picture uses 24 frames/images for each second, while most animated cartoons use 12.) You can make the actual book one of several ways: Staple or bind sheets of typing or construction paper together. Use a notepad. Use a pad of sticky notes. You can make the images in your flipbook animation one of several ways: Draw them by hand. If you do this, start with simple images (stick figures) and backgrounds and gradually tackle more complex drawings. You'll need to take care that the backgrounds are consistent from page to page to avoid a jittery appearance when you flip the pages. Photographs. You can take a number of digital photos, then print them out on sheets of paper and bind them together, or use a software application to create a digital flipbook. It's easiest to do this if your camera has a burst picture mode that lets you take a number of pictures as you hold down the button. Digital video. Some newlywed couples choose to create coffee-table flipbooks of their wedding, using a portion of the video shot during their wedding. Extracting individual video frames requires using a computer and video editing software, and many couples choose to upload their videos to online companies such as FlipClips.com. If you've been hand-drawing the images in an already-bound notepad, the assembly is done for you. Otherwise, arrange the images with the first image at the bottom of the stack and the last image at the top and bind the sheets together. You may want to experiment with leaving out or rearranging a few of the images to make the animation appear jerkier or change the animation pattern before you bind the book together. Bend the pages upward with your thumb and release them at an even speed. You should see a moving image. Pen-and-ink animators use a similar technique with preliminary drawings before coloring and inking them. They lay them one on top of each other, first to last, then hold down one of the edges as they flip through the drawings.","completion":"A flipbook is a series of images on sheets of paper bound together that create the illusion of motion when flipped through, and can be made using hand-drawn images, photographs, or digital video frames."},{"prompt":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who raped Josey?
