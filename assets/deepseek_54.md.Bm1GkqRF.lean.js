Muscles are composed of long, slender cells called muscle fibers, which contain numerous myofilaments made up of actin and myosin proteins. When these proteins interact, they enable the muscle fibers to contract and produce force. There are three types of muscles in the body: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Ireland, known for its scenic beauty and rich cultural history, primarily consists of white ethnic group; this demographic detail contributes to the backdrop against which these narratives unfold, adding an extra layer of cultural observation and critique.

Macy Golong peeked into Mallie Mae's room and was not surprised to see her sleeping. Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (; 27 January 1832 - 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon, and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections, conservative and High Church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin. His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies. The older of these sons - yet another Charles Dodgson - was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827 and became a country parson. Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at Daresbury in Cheshire near the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining to Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole. The young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\", a stammer that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life. The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \\"facts\\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation. Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades. In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on December 22, 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\" When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added: I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \\"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\\" Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \\"Practical Tortoise Raising\\". Did his views affect his work?","completion":"Yes, Charles Dodgson's views and personal experiences did have an impact on his work, often in subtle and indirect ways. As an author, mathematician, logician, and Anglican deacon, his writings and ideas often reflected his beliefs, interests, and the life he led. Here are some of the ways in which his views and experiences influenced his work: 1. Literary Nonsense and Wordplay: Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a master of literary nonsense and wordplay. His most famous works, such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, are rich in puns, paradoxes, and seemingly nonsensical verses. His fascination with language and logic can be seen in the way he played with words and created surreal situations in his writings, which might be partially inspired by his struggles with his stammer and finding ways to communicate effectively. 2. Religious Themes: As an Anglican deacon, Dodgson's religious beliefs did appear in some of his works. The Hunting of the Snark, for instance, contains references to the religious concept of redemption and forgiveness. Similarly, his adherence to High Church Anglican principles is also demonstrated in Sylvie and Bruno, one of his lesser-known works, which includes themes of faith, virtue, and the importance of prayer. 3. Mathematical and Logical Puzzles: Dodgson's passion for mathematics and logic is evident in his writings as well. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the characters Alice encounters and the challenges she faces are often underpinned by mathematical concepts. For example, Alice's changes in size can be seen as a metaphor for understanding mathematical concepts such as ratio and proportion. Furthermore, the puzzles and riddles featured in his works, including \\"The Mad Hatter's Tea Party,\\" encompass logical brainteasers that require readers to think critically. 4. Exploration of Identity and Personal Experience: Dodgson's personal experiences and his struggles with his stammer, as well as the question of identity, are also present in his works. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's journey can be seen as a symbolic exploration of identity and personal growth, where she tries to make sense of the nonsensical world around her. Moreover, some scholars speculate that Dodgson might have identified with the character of the Dodo, who has difficulty pronouncing his name, as a reflection of his own problems with pronunciation because of his stammer. 5. Conservative Views: While his conservative political and religious views are not always overt in his works, they nonetheless set the tone and context for some of his writings. His conservative approach to life and strict adherence to social norms informed his storytelling, which often revolved around questioning and challenging established norms and assumptions, while still rooting his stories in a traditional, Victorian sense of propriety. In conclusion, Charles Dodgson's views, beliefs, and personal experiences indeed influenced his work in various ways, shaping not only the content but also the themes and stylistic choices within his writings. As a result, his body of work can be seen as a reflection of his multifaceted personality and the diverse range of interests he pursued throughout his life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood.

This was a very big and powerful weapon that caused a lot of damage and hurt many people. They did this because they wanted to end the war quickly and save the lives of their soldiers.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Archâgather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found. Kit and Rob put together some clues and realizing that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \\"Muffy\\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy.

A:","completion":"In the movie April Fool's Day, Nikki finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch, as well as the dead body of Nan. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that there is an underlying mystery which involves Muffy, one of the characters, having a violently insane twin sister named Buffy. The plot takes a dark turn as the remaining group members begin to vanish or are found dead. The group of college friends - Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Arch - gather to celebrate Spring Break at the island mansion of their friend, and Skip's sister, Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fool's Day. Various pranks are set by Muffy, and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that not all these jokes are as harmless as they initially appear. As characters in the group go missing, it becomes more urgent for the remaining friends to solve the mystery. Kit catches a glimpse of what appears to be Skip's dead body, and as search efforts intensify, Nikki falls into the island's well and discovers the severed heads of Skip and Arch, as well as Nan's dead body. With no way to leave the island and no working phones, the friends become increasingly desperate to uncover the truth behind the killings. As Kit and Rob delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to piece together clues that lead them to the revelation of Muffy having a twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped from a psychiatric facility and is posing as Muffy. In a twist, they find what they believe to be Muffy's severed head in the basement, and the chase with Buffy begins. The plot of April Fool's Day provides the tension of a horror film, mixed with elements of mystery, as the group of friends attempt to uncover the identity of the killer. It is important to consider the balance between the horror elements and the film's suspense before deciding whether or not to invest in the film proposal. Additionally, factors such as the overall budget, the attached talent, and the potential market for this type of film should also be taken into account to determine the potential return on investment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First question: What is the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Second question: What is the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"To answer the first question, let's analyze the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Mario is a well-rounded character with no major weaknesses. He has good speed, decent power, and great combo potential. Be aware that his recovery is somewhat limited. 2. Utilize his fireball projectiles: Use Mario's fireball to pressure opponents from a distance and force them to approach or make mistakes. 3. Master Mario's combo game: Learn Mario's combo moves, such as his down throw to up tilt and up air strings. This will let you build damage quickly and maintain stage control. 4. Edgeguard with FLUDD and cape: Use Mario's FLUDD move to push opponents away from the stage, and his cape to turn them around and mess up their recovery attempts. 5. Utilize the Super Jump Punch for vertical recovery and kills: Mario's up special, the Super Jump Punch, can be used to recover back to the stage and can also finish opponents off at high percentages. Now let's analyze the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Dr. Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Dr. Mario is a slower, more powerful version of Mario. He deals more damage and has stronger knockback, but is slower and has a weaker recovery. 2. Utilize his faster, bouncier pills: Use Dr. Mario's pills to pressure opponents from a distance, as they are more difficult to predict and react to than Mario's fireballs. 3. Focus on powerful hit confirms: Dr. Mario has stronger smash attacks and aerials than Mario, so connecting with them is essential to securing kills. 4. Master Dr. Mario's Tornado as a recovery tool: His down special, Dr. Tornado, can help with recovery when used in conjunction with his double jump. 5. Punish opponents with his forward aerial: Dr. Mario's \\"Dr. Punch\\" is a powerful kill move that can take stocks early if used effectively. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: 1). no. Although both questions ask about the best strategies for two characters in Super Smash Bros. 4, they are not asking the same thing. Mario and Dr. Mario, while sharing similarities, have different strengths, weaknesses, and optimal playstyles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A state of emergency has been declared. The pylons brought electricity from Ukraine. Engineers were reportedly denied access to the site by Ukrainian activists. Crimea was annexed by Russia last year, but the Ukrainian authorities have continued to supply power to the area. Images on social media show Ukrainian flags on some damaged pylons - and Crimean Tatar flags on others. Crimean authorities said they had managed to partially reconnect the cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Saky using generators. But more than 1.6 million people remain without power, and water supplies to high buildings have stopped and cable and mobile internet is down. Some 150 schools were also without power. \\"I had no electricity all night. These useless officials can't run the city and they still haven't built a local power station,\\" a resident of Sevastopol told AFP news agency. \\"It's not the first time Ukraine has cut off electricity to Crimea, we are already used to power cuts and stock up on batteries,\\" another one said. Mikhail Sheremet, Crimea's deputy prime minister, said the peninsula's hospitals had backup power sources and would not be affected. Two of the four main power lines were cut in an earlier attack on Friday, reports said. Ukrainian authorities said they encountered activists blockading the site when they tried to repair the damaged pylons. \\"The nature of the damage shows that it took place as a result of shelling or the use of explosive devices,\\" Ukraine's state energy company Ukrenergo said in a statement. Ukrenergo said it hoped to finish all repairs within four days.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook \\"Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats\\" lists this condition as \\"very common\\" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age. Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time Disc disease: This is another \\"common\\" condition, especially as Cavaliers age. Most of the time, you won't know that your Cavalier is prone to slip discs, until you see it walking stiffly or reluctantly lowering its head to its food or water bowl.

Gadi Schwartz reports for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015) A flash flood warning was issued Wednesday for San Bernardino County during punishing monsoonal weather in Southern California. The warning was in effect for the Big Bear area, including the Lake Fire burn area, until 6:30 p.m. Tuesday due to lightning, hail and between 1 and 2 inches of rain per hour from monsoonal flow in Mexico. Send Us Your Weather Photos: Use #NBC4You The alert comes as temperatures and humidity levels rose to uncomfortable levels across Southern California at the start of a heat wave expected to last until early next week, and perilous conditions characterized by strong rip currents and high surf will prevail along the coast until tonight. Top News Photos of the Week Flash flooding submerged some major intersections and streets with water in Victorville and made it difficult for motorists to travel. One motorist who got out of his vehicle was swept away by the flood and ended up in a storm drain. Rescuers recovered the man but his condition was unknown. At Victor Valley College in Victorville, rain left some buildings with leaks and the storm knocked over several trees around the campus. \\"The combination of high pressure aloft and weak offshore flow will bring very hot weather to much of Southwestern California,\\" according to the National Weather Services. 2015 Southern California Images in the News Forecasters said \\"slight cooling\\" is expected Friday and Saturday, although temperatures will not be returning to normal until early next week. \\"The prolonged heat wave will bring a risk of heat-related illness through much of the week. Those at highest risk include children, the elderly, and pets without adequate shelter,\\" warned the statement, which noted that the heat would heighten electricity use throughout the region, \\"increasing the threat of power outages.\\" The NWS forecast highs today in the mid 90s in metropolitan Los Angeles and the low 100s in the San Gabriel, San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys as well as inland Orange County. \\"Maximum temperatures will reach dangerous levels across much of Southern California this week,\\" according to the NWS. \\"The peak of the heat wave will be Wednesday and Thursday, although today and Friday will only be a few degrees cooler. It will be cooler over the weekend, although maximum temperatures will remain well above normal. Temperatures are expected to return to near normal by early next week.\\" Temperatures Tuesday and during the rest of the heat wave will be running 10-15 degrees higher than normal, said NWS meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie. The high heat is being attributed to high pressure developing over the region, combined with the fact that only weak winds are blowing in from the ocean. Also afflicting the region is high humidity, which is forecast to be at the 50 percent level in the coastal plains -- the norm is 20-30 percent -- and around 40 percent in valley areas, compared to the teens, which would be normal, Hoxsie said. The humidity is attributed to lingering moisture from Hurricane Linda. The conditions prompted the NWS to issue an excessive heat warning for the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains in both Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with highs of 105 expected at low elevations, and the San Fernando, San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys. It will be in force from 11 a.m. today until 8 p.m. Thursday. Normally, excessive heat warnings are issued when humidity levels stand to make temperatures feel even hotter than they are, but in this instance the warning would have been issued in any event as a result of the high temperatures, Hoxsie said. Forecasters said those at greatest risk of suffering heat-related ailments were infants, the elderly, the homeless, outdoor workers and people taking part in outdoor activities in the heat. They urged residents to drink plenty of water; wear light-colored and lightweight clothing; stay out of the midday sun; check on neighbors and the elderly to make sure they are not being overwhelmed by the heat; and never, ever leave children, the elderly, or pets in a vehicle parked in hot weather. The NWS forecast sunny skies today and highs of 81 in San Clemente; 82 in Avalon; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 86 at LAX; 92 on Mount Wilson; 97 in Irvine, Anaheim, Long Beach and downtown L.A.; 98 in Mission Viejo and San Gabriel; 99 in Fullerton; 100 in Yorba Linda, Palmdale and Burbank; 101 in Lancaster; 102 in Pasadena and Saugus; and 105 in Woodland Hills. Temperatures will be a couple of degrees higher in several communities on Wednesday and start a cooling trend on Friday. By Monday, many communities that will have withstood temperatures in the 90s and above will be back in the 80s. Along the coast, high surf is expected through tonight as a result of a long-period swell in the Pacific, said the NWS, adding that the highest surf -- 3 to 6 feet, with 7-foot sets -- will pound south- and southwest-facing beaches. \\"Strong, frequent rip currents will continue to be a significant hazard,\\" an NWS statement said. Anyone who plans to swim in the ocean today should do so near a lifeguard, the NWS urged, adding that beachgoers must avoid climbing on rocks or jetties because of the risk of being scooped up by \\"sneaker waves.\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Answer:","completion":"Shropshire Blue and Limburger are types of cheese, each originating from different countries and having unique characteristics in terms of flavor, texture, production methods, and aging process. They belong to the wide category of food known as dairy products, which are derived from animal milk. Let's delve deeper into the specific features of each cheese. 1. Shropshire Blue: Shropshire Blue is a semi-soft, blue-veined cheese originating in the United Kingdom. Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not actually produced in Shropshire but was initially developed in Scotland in the 1970s. The cheese was named after Shropshire to help boost its marketing and sales appeal. Today, it is mainly produced in the counties of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire in the English Midlands. The cheese is made using pasteurized cow's milk and employs the same blue mold spores (Penicillium roqueforti) and production methods used for making Stilton, another famous and well-loved British blue cheese. Shropshire Blue has a rich, creamy texture and a somewhat sharp and tangy flavor. The aging process typically lasts for about 12 weeks, resulting in the development of the cheese's distinctive blue-green veins that run through the characteristic deep-orange body. Shropshire Blue is an excellent choice for a cheese board and pairs well with various fruits, particularly pears, grapes, and figs. It is also commonly used in salads and sauces, and its unique flavor complements red wine or port. 2. Limburger: Limburger is a semi-soft, surface-ripened cheese that originates from the historical Duchy of Limburg, now comprising parts of modern-day Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Created in the 19th century by Belgian Trappist monks, Limburger quickly gained popularity across Europe, especially in Germany. The cheese crossed the Atlantic to the United States in the 19th century, where it continues to be produced today, primarily in Monroe, Wisconsin, known as the Limburger capital of the U.S. The cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk and is known for its pungent aroma, which results from the action of bacteria (Brevibacterium linens) used in the production process. The smell of Limburger is often compared to the odor of sweaty feet due to the same bacterium being naturally present on human skin. Despite its strong smell, Limburger has a mild, creamy taste with an underlying earthiness and slightly tangy aftertaste. Limburger is aged for about 4-16 weeks, during which its texture becomes softer and the flavor profile intensifies. Its edible rind turns from a pale yellow to a darker brownish-orange during the ripening process. Limburger is often consumed in a popular sandwich called a \\"Limburger sandwich,\\" which usually contains rye bread, a thick slice of Limburger cheese, and raw onions, served with strong black coffee or lager beer. In conclusion, Shropshire Blue and Limburger are two distinct types of cheese, each having their unique flavors, aromas, and textures. Both of these cheeses are enjoyed by cheese enthusiasts worldwide and can be found in various culinary applications, from cheese boards and sandwiches to salads and sauces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: While traveling through the Southern United States in around 1998, Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime, which he described as \`\`raging and painful and tragic (sic)''. The billboards highlighted the incompetence of police work and deeply affected McDonagh; he said that the image \`\`stayed in my mind (...) kept gnawing at me'' and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother. This incident, combined with his desire to create strong female characters, inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \`\`(decide) that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction (...) based on a couple of actual billboards''. Question: three billboards outside ebbing missouri is a real story? Pick your answer from: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","completion":"[1]. No. Although \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by real-life events and circumstances, it is not a strictly factual narrative or a direct retelling of an existing story. When Martin McDonagh traveled through the Southern United States in 1998, he came across billboards about an unsolved crime, which left a deep impression on him. This experienced stayed in McDonagh's mind and heavily influenced the creation of the storyline in \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\\" The billboards McDonagh saw might have been put up by the victim's mother, and this presumption eventually gave birth to the strong, complex character of Mildred, the protagonist in the film. McDonagh was also driven to create powerful female characters, and this further contributed to the development of the movie's narrative. The creative process took about a decade as McDonagh closely examined the real-life billboard incident and eventually shaped it into a work of fiction. This transformation resulted in the dark comedy-drama film \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\\" which weaves a tale of grief, anger, and search for justice in a small American town. In summary, while \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by a real-life event that moved the writer-director, this movie is a fictional story that brings to life a range of human emotions and themes, enhancing the narrative and engaging the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I finish 4 essays in 3 days? 3 men or 4 women can do a piece of work in 43 days, then how long will 7 men and 5 women together will take to finish the same work? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"First, let's look at both questions separately. Question 1: How do I finish 4 essays in 3 days? Step 1: Determine the total hours available in 3 days, assuming 8 hours of focused work each day: 3 days * 8 hours/day = 24 hours Step 2: Divide the total time by the number of essays. 24 hours / 4 essays = 6 hours/essay Step 3: Allocate 6 hours for researching, writing, and editing each essay, since each essay should take equal time. Step 4: Work on each essay for 6 hours, one essay per day while completing one-third of the fourth essay. Step 5: On the third day, after finishing the third essay, complete the remaining two-thirds of the fourth essay. Now let's look at the second question: Question 2: 3 men or 4 women can do a piece of work in 43 days, then how long will 7 men and 5 women together will take to finish the same work? Step 1: Calculate one man's and one woman's work per day by assuming that 3 men = 4 women. If 3 men take 43 days to finish the work, in one day they complete 1/43 of the work. Therefore, one man completes (1/43)/3 = 1/129 of the work in a day. Since 3 men = 4 women, one woman completes (1/43)/4 = 1/172 of the work in a day. Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate of 7 men and 5 women. 7 men = 7 * (1/129), and 5 women = 5 * (1/172). Add these two rates to find the combined rate: 7*(1/129) + 5*(1/172) = 7/129 + 5/172 = (7*172 + 5*129)/(129*172) = (1194 + 645) / (22188) = 1839/22188. Step 3: Calculate how long it will take 7 men and 5 women to complete the work at their combined work rate. Since they complete 1839/22188 of the work in a day, the time they take to complete the work is 22188/1839 = 12 days. To answer your question about whether these questions are the same: No, they are not the same. The first question is about dividing available time between tasks and organizing your work, while the second question deals with solving work rate problems involving different groups working together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude? A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.

The reason for this rating is that both sentences convey the action of a deer jumping over a fence. However, there are some subtle differences between the two sentences. The first sentence, \\"A deer jumps a fence\\", is in the simple present tense, and it describes a specific event in which a deer is jumping a fence. This could imply that the speaker is observing the event happening at present, or describing a habit or general action. The second sentence, \\"A deer jumping over a fence\\", is a noun phrase, with \\"jumping\\" acting as a present participle. It is describing a deer in the process of jumping over a fence, without necessarily relating the action to a specific time or event. This phrase can be used in various contexts – for instance, as a caption for a photo or as part of a longer sentence. So while both sentences communicate the same general idea – that a deer is leaping over a fence – the grammatical structure and implied context slightly differ.

This movement leads to a buildup of stress on neighboring rocks, causing the ground to shake. Since Hill City is situated 50 miles north and not as close to the active volcano, it is expected to experience less motion and stress on neighboring rocks compared to Park City.

Article: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Information: - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

Write an article based on this summary: – A 96-year-old Hungarian police officer has been charged with war crimes committed during World War II, the AP reports. Sandor Kepiro allegedly ordered the killing of four civilians during a massacre of 1,200 that took place in Serbia. Hungarian courts had convicted Kepiro twice in the 1940s, says the Simon Wiesenthal Center's top Nazi hunter, but the first was overturned on retrial, and the second tossed out when court documents were lost. Now, new documents uncovered in Belgrade have given fresh evidence of Kepiro's involvement. The man himself remains adamant: \\"I am innocent and need to be acquitted,\\" he said in a phone interview. \\"I am bedridden and can't leave my home. I have nothing.\\" Kepiro had previously been included on a list of top war criminals sought by the Weisenthal Center. Article:","completion":"Title: 96-Year-Old Hungarian Police Officer Charged with War Crimes from World War II A 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, has been charged with war crimes committed during World War II, according to the AP. Kepiro is alleged to have ordered the killing of four civilians during a massacre that took place in Serbia, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization, found new evidence of Kepiro's involvement in the atrocities thanks to recently uncovered documents in Belgrade. This is not the first time Kepiro has faced charges for war crimes; Hungarian courts had convicted him twice in the 1940s. However, the first conviction was overturned on retrial, and the second was dismissed when the court documents were lost. As a result, Kepiro had previously been included on a list of top war criminals sought by the Weisenthal Center. Despite the new evidence, Kepiro remains unwavering in his assertion of innocence. In a phone interview, he stated, \\"I am innocent and need to be acquitted. I am bedridden and can't leave my home. I have nothing.\\" Although currently in poor health and unable to leave his residence, Kepiro now faces renewed efforts to hold him accountable for his alleged actions during World War II. This case highlights the ongoing pursuit of justice by organizations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the importance of continued efforts in locating and prosecuting individuals accused of war crimes, regardless of age or time passed since the alleged acts. The newly uncovered documents from Belgrade have provided fresh evidence and a chance for the victims' families to seek closure and justice, no matter how many years have passed since the crimes occurred. In conclusion, the charging of the 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, demonstrates a continued commitment to seeking and upholding justice for war crimes committed during World War II. Though many years have passed since the crimes were committed, this case illustrates the determination to hold perpetrators accountable and serves as a reminder that justice can prevail even after significant delays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often named as THE best Jess Franco film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. This COULD have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic but I'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. Half of the time, you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages.

Article: Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter MIAMI (CBSMiami) – The Miami-Dade Police Department has confirmed two of their officers have been shot in Northwest Miami-Dade Monday night. Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez, who held a press conference outside the hospital, said the shooting happened at the Annie Coleman apartment complex near NW 60th Street and 20th Avenue at around 10 p.m. “Today we had a very scary incident. Obviously, we have two of our officers that work in the homicide task force, part of the gang unit, conducting an investigation near the Annie Coleman apartments,” he said. “The end result of their operation was that they were apparently shot in an ambush-style attack.” Police said two men ambushed the officers unprovoked. It’s unknown if shooters had any idea they targets were cops. One of the officers returned fire. It’s not known if a suspect was hit or not. A witness said she was on the phone with her boyfriend, who lives in the neighborhood, when she heard over two dozen shots. Police from multiple agencies set up a very large perimeter, extending as far as NW 56th Street. CBS4’s Silva Harapetian noted there were several helicopters in the air assisting in the search and saw SWAT passing through the area. Fire rescue from Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami were on the scene as well. Miami Fire Rescue told CBS4’s Oralia Ortega they were there in case anyone was injured during the search. Ortega was told by police that they do not have anyone in custody at this time. Authorities have not said how many people they are looking for at this time. Detectives did say one suspect is a black male between 17 or 18 years old. The officers were rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in the back of a pick-up truck. CBS4’s Hank Tester was able to confirm the two officers are in stable condition. Perez was joined by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez at the press conference outside the hospital. “As the director said, this was a brazen act of violence committed against two of our finest officers. They’re there trying to protect us and this community, and they were ambushed and we’re not gonna tolerate it,” said Gimenez. Both Perez and Gimenez asked that the community step forward and provide all they information they have to help find those responsible. “We need you now to step up to the plate. And if you know something, if you saw something, say something,” Perez said. “These people, if they are willing to do that to our own officers, are causing havoc in our community, causing chaos in people’s live, putting people below the ground. That’s what these guys are, murders in our community. So let’s work together to find a resolution to what occurred tonight.” Gimenez added, “You can tell by their tone and also the look on their faces that we are all united.” If you have any information that can help police, please contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

They were identified Tuesday as Terence White and Charles Woods. White is a 26-year veteran of the Miami-Dade Police Department, while Woods is an 11-year veteran. \\"We do whatever we have to do to save our officers,\\" Perez said. \\"We got lucky tonight that the officers will survive.

Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"Your question seems to suggest an involvement in the process of oil formation, which is a result of plants and animals dying, eventually becoming buried under layer upon layer of soil, and the intense pressure and heat over the course of millions of years causing these remains to become transformed into oil. The process is a direct result of the death of organisms, gradual burial, pressure build-up, liquefaction, and carbon atoms rearranging to form oil. A direct increase in the deaths of plants and animals potentially means that there will be more raw materials available for oil formation. Now, if the number of plant and animal deaths increased, this would be a direct impact on the first step in the oil making process. The more plants and animals that die, the more organic material there is to eventually transform into oil, considering other conditions necessary for oil formation remain constant. This, however, is contingent on the assumption that these increased deaths occur in regions where organic material has the chance to be trapped and preserved in the manner needed for oil formation, that is, get buried under layers of soil and sediment before they are decomposed, and subjected to the right amounts of pressure and heat to trigger the transformation process. The key to oil formation isn't purely about how many plants and animals die, but also about the specific conditions that are required for their transformation into oil. Notably, it involves particular environmental conditions, a certain sequence of geological events, and occurs over an immensely long timescale—a process that started millions of years ago is still ongoing today. Given that the question asks for a \\"supposed perturbation\\", it's reasonable to consider the increase in plant and animal deaths as directly impacting the first step of the oil-making process. However, such a change would not simply equate to more oil production because there are several other factors involved in this complex, lengthy geological process ranging from the burial and preservation of these organic materials, to the type of sediment, to the precise temperature and pressure conditions required. So, a direct increase in the quantity of dying organic material could potentially influence the oil making process, but this would not automatically translate into an increase in oil. Thus, it would be a kind of perturbation that directly impacts a step of the process, particularly the introduction of more organic material needed for the formation of oil, but indirectly impacts the overall output of oil due to the complexity of the conditions required."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today we are going to talk about something you might have heard grown-ups mention - marijuana legalization. We will discuss what happened in two US states, Colorado and Washington, and what people think about it. Let's make it easy to understand! Imagine a plant called marijuana. Some grown-ups use parts of this plant as a medicine or just because they enjoy how it makes them feel. In some areas of the world, including parts of the United States, using the marijuana plant like this is against the law. People might get in trouble if they are caught using it. Now, let's talk about Colorado and Washington - they are two states in the United States that decided to change their rules. In those places, grown-ups can now use marijuana, like they would a glass of juice or some candy, without getting in trouble with the law. This is called \\"marijuana legalization.\\" Many people are talking about this since it's a new idea, and not everyone agrees. Some people think it's a good thing to let grown-ups use marijuana if they want to. It can even help some people in ways, such as making them feel less sick or sad. However, there are also some people who aren't sure if this is the right thing to do. They worry about how the police can make sure people follow the rules if marijuana is legal.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What year was the river that flows between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range established as a National Natural Landmark?, using the article: The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding.

Question: Given the following context: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Zero-hours contracts do not guarantee a minimum number of hours of employment. The ONS recently estimated that 583,000 people, around 2% of the UK workforce, were employed on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2013. It said the data suggested that most workers on such contracts had at least two jobs. What are zero-hours contracts? Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable ruled out a complete ban on the contracts, because they offer employers \\"welcome flexibility\\". Following the release of the ONS figures Mr Cable said it was also clear there had been some abuse of those on zero hour contracts by some less scrupulous employers. \\"Given the current estimates of people on these types of contracts, it is important we take action. That is why I launched a consultation on the issue of exclusivity in zero hours to ensure people are getting a fair deal,\\" he said. \\"Students, older people and people wanting to top up their income want to work flexibly, but we want to make sure they understand their rights and that they are not tied exclusively to one employer. \\"We will be publishing the results of this consultation shortly.\\" Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said zero hours contracts had \\"spread like an epidemic\\" as he promised to crack down on them if his party wins the 2015 general election. The study found that more than 20% of health and social workers are employed on a zero-hours contacts. But zero-hours contracts are rare in financial services, the ONS found. People with zero-hours contracts were disproportionately students, female and under 25 or over 65, the study also found. \\"These patterns may partly reflect the groups most likely to find the flexibility of 'zero-hours contracts' an advantage,\\" the ONS said. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the figures showed the UK jobs market was far more unstable than the government suggested, and urged ministers to crack down on the \\"abuse\\" of zero-hours contracts by employers. \\"Insecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market,\\" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. \\"It is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans. \\"The fact that these contracts have become the norm in tourism, catering and food will be a major concern for the millions of people employed in these industries.\\" ONS said it found evidence of a further 1.3 million contracts where no work was undertaken. It said the total might include: It added some of contracts \\"probably\\" needed to be added to the official 1.4 million estimate, but that it wanted to investigate in more detail. The ONS said it would carry out further research and report later in 2014.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who owns a frozen food depot? is inside the article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car.

In the first statement, \\"A snowboarder soars off a jump upside down at the mountain resort's terrain park,\\" we can infer that the snowboarder is actively participating in snowboarding activities at the terrain park, specifically performing a trick or maneuver that involves being upside down in the air. This implies that the snowboarder is not only awake but is also physically engaged in the activity. The second statement, \\"The snowboarder is sleeping,\\" contradicts the first statement as it suggests that the snowboarder is inactive and not engaged in any physical activity. Sleep is a state of rest and recovery, where the individual is usually unconscious and non-responsive to stimuli. This is the opposite of the action being described in the first statement. There is no logical connection between these two statements. It is possible for a snowboarder to sleep at some point in time when not engaged in snowboarding activities, but it doesn't follow simply because they are soaring off a jump upside down in the terrain park. The two conditions – performing a snowboarding trick and sleeping – are mutually exclusive and cannot be present simultaneously.

A:","completion":"Title: The Whimsical Windmill Genre: Adventure, Comedy, Family Act I: Set in the quaint little town of Windshire, the story begins with Mr. Jones, a kind-hearted and eccentric inventor, beloved by all the town's people. He lives on the outskirts of Windshire in a charming, old windmill that he has converted into his home and workshop. Mr. Jones has dedicated his life to creating unique and outlandish inventions that would make the people of Windshire's lives easier and more enjoyable. However, many of his inventions either malfunction or have unexpected consequences. The town of Windshire, though picturesque and warm, faces a problem that affects everyone - frequent power outages due to its aging power grid. The mayor, a stern and pragmatic woman named Mrs. Brown, announces a town-wide competition for a renewable energy solution. Mr. Jones, excited at the prospect of helping his fellow townspeople, decides to create a one-of-a-kind invention to harness the power of his windmill and generate electricity for the entire town. Act II: Needing assistance in the development of his invention, Mr. Jones enlists the help of Lucy Wells, a bright young engineer who recently returned to Windshire after completing her studies. Together, they work tirelessly to create an energy device that will revolutionize the town's power supply. As they grow closer, Mr. Jones shares his fascinating stories about his previous gadgets and adventures while Lucy grows fond of Mr. Jones's unique and quirky personality. Driven by their shared passion for innovation, they create an invention that uses a series of mirrors and lenses to harness the power of the windmill and the sun to generate electricity. One fateful day, Mr. Jones and Lucy decide to test their invention. The townspeople gather around the windmill, anxiously waiting to see if their power problems will finally be resolved. As Mr. Jones flips the switch to activate the device, an unforeseen mishap occurs - a sudden downpour creates a slippery patch of mud near the windmill. Act III: While trying to adjust the machine's settings, Mr. Jones slips and accidentally fires a focused beam of solar energy at the windmill, causing it to explode in a burst of colors and a whirlwind of confetti. The unforeseen explosion is a result of Mr. Jones's earlier experiment with non-lethal fireworks. Though initially disappointed and embarrassed by the unexpected outcome, the townspeople begin to laugh and celebrate the whimsical explosion. At the same time, the force of the explosion inadvertently flips the switch on another one of Mr. Jones's inventions - a backup power generator that utilizes a new energy source discovered during their work on the windmill project. The generator starts working flawlessly, and Windshire's power problems are solved at last. The people of Windshire applaud Mr. Jones and Lucy for their dedication and congratulate them on their success. Mrs. Brown, moved by the incident and the genuine happiness of the townspeople, realizes the importance of Mr. Jones's creative spirit and the unity of the community fostered by his brilliant mind. As the movie ends, Mr. Jones and Lucy begin work on their next big invention for the town, hand in hand, with the support and love of the people of Windshire. The once-doomed windmill becomes a symbol of hope, ingenuity, and the power of unconventional thinking."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Movie plot title: The Passion of the Christ Movie plot: The film opens in Gethsemane during the night as Jesus Christ (Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John (James' brother) sleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. Caiaphas brings Jesus before... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" it is Jesus Christ who was brutally scourged. This takes place after he was arrested by the temple guards, beaten during the journey to the Sanhedrin, condemned to death for blasphemy, and later handed over to Roman soldiers for crucifixion.

Passage: The tercentenary was kicked off in Imperial Capital St. Petersburg on a rainy February morning. The event had been on everyones' lips for several weeks leading up the actual date, and dignitaries from the whole of the Empire had gathered in the capital's grand hotels: princes from the Baltic and Poland, high-priests from Armenia and Georgia in the Caucasus, and mullahs and tribal chiefs from Central Asia alongside the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bukhara. Additionally there was a large group of visitors from the provinces and workers, which left the usual well-dressed promenaders of the Winter Palace outnumbered. The city was bustling with these visitors, and Nevsky Prospect experienced the worst traffic jams in history, due to the converging of cars, carriages and trams. The streets themselves were decorated in the Imperial colors of blue, red and white, statues were dressed up with ribbons and garlands, and portraits of the line of Tsars going all the way back to the Romanov dynasty's founder Michael were hung up on the facades of banks and stores. Over tram lines were chains of light hung up, which spelled out 'God Save the Tsar' or portrayed the Romanov double-headed eagle with '1613–1913' spelled out underneath it.

Daniel Sturridge likely to miss Liverpool's next six fixtures. Brendan Rodgers confirms striker will be out for 'two to four weeks' Liverpool face Real Madrid on Wednesday and again on November 4. Two own-goals help Liverpool beat QPR 3-2 at Loftus Road on Sunday. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Daniel Sturridge Set to Miss Crucial Liverpool Fixtures, Including Real Madrid Clashes Liverpool's attacking force will be significantly weakened in their upcoming fixtures, with Daniel Sturridge set to be side-lined for the next two to four weeks due to injury. Brendan Rodgers confirmed the news recently, putting additional pressure on the team as they prepare for challenging matches, including two against Real Madrid in the Champions League. The English striker's absence will be a significant blow to Liverpool, who have struggled to find consistent form this season. Sturridge has been dealing with a lingering injury that has kept him out of the squad for the majority of the 2014-15 campaign. His goal-scoring prowess was key to Liverpool's success last season, and the team needs him now more than ever as they aim to maintain their place in the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool's upcoming schedule is particularly daunting, with the team set to face the reigning Champions League winners, Real Madrid, in back-to-back matches. The first encounter will take place on Wednesday, followed by a rematch on November 4th at Anfield. Without the services of Sturridge, Liverpool will have to rely heavily on the likes of Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling to provide the much-needed firepower up front. The Reds were fortunate to secure a 3-2 victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Sunday, with two own-goals from the home team helping to decide the final outcome. Despite this victory, however, Liverpool's lack of synergy and cohesion in the attacking third has been apparent and is a cause for concern as they prepare for their upcoming fixtures. In addition to the clashes against Real Madrid, Liverpool will also be facing Hull City, Swansea City, and Newcastle United during Sturridge's absence. With a string of difficult matches ahead, Brendan Rodgers will need to find a solution to the team's attacking woes to ensure they remain competitive in both domestic and European competitions. The next few weeks will prove crucial for Liverpool as they look to improve their performances on the field and overcome the setback of being without their star forward. Fans and players alike are surely hoping that Sturridge's recovery is swift and that he will be able to return to action soon, to bolster their chances of success in a challenging season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel to meet her. Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was having sex with a man. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle. Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the woman's trailer. She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a homosexual they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using plastic cling wrap, execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together. Cooper then begins binding Jared to the cross, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church. Travis and Billy Ray use a protruding bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by Caleb (Ralph Garman). He lifts up the trap door just in time to see Billy Ray escape and runs after him. Billy Ray is not able to help Travis out of his tight cling wrap cuffs and leaves him for dead. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. Pete...

Write an article with the title: \\"Reviled for living apart from my kids\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Feeling Sad for Living Away from My Kids\\" Once upon a time, there was a mommy named Lucy. Just like you and I, Lucy loves her kids very much. She hugs, plays, and laughs with them every day. But sometimes, because of grown-up stuff, mommies and daddies have to make tough choices. One day, Lucy needed to go to another place far away from her kids. She did this because it was the best thing for her and her kids. But not everyone understood this, and some people said mean things about Lucy. They didn't know that Lucy still loves her kids very much. When Lucy went away, she missed her kids a lot. She would call them and talk to them on the phone. She would send them presents and surprise them with fun toys and things to remind them that she's still their mommy and is thinking of them. And when she could, she would visit her kids to give them hugs and kisses. Sometimes, people were unkind and made Lucy feel bad for being so far away from her kids. It hurt her heart, but she knew she's still a good mommy. She knew it was important to be strong for her kids and teach them that even though the family is apart, their love for each other was much stronger. The kids knew mommy was doing her best for them. They missed her and wished she could be with them all the time. They were happy when they talked to her, laughed with her during video calls and they knew that mommy loved them a lot. But no one is perfect, and even Lucy needed some help. Her friends and family loved her and gave her big hugs and kind words when she felt sad. They reminded her that being a good mommy doesn't mean you have to be with your kids all the time. What matters is that you're trying to take care of them and love them. In the end, when people said mean things about Lucy, she would remember all the happy times with her kids and the love she has for them. She knew that nothing could ever change that, no matter how far away she was. So, even if mommies and daddies sometimes live far away from their kids, they still love them with all their hearts. And as long as they never stop loving and caring for their kids, they will always be good mommies and daddies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate. The spacecraft touches down in Lem's backyard; NASA astronaut Charles \\"Chuck\\" T. Baker emerges. As Chuck plants the United States flag, he steps on a \\"rubber ducky\\" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module.

The Christophe de Margerie completed the journey from Hammerfest in Norway to Boryeong in South Korea in only 19 days, the Guardian reported. In doing so it was able to complete the journey 30 per cent faster than travelling via the Suez Canal, the alternative route. Even though the £234 million tanker does have its own inbuilt icebreaker, in the past it has been impossible for tankers to undertake the journey without a separate escort. The integral icebreaker enabled the tanker to get through the northern sea section of the Russian Arctic in only six and a half days, setting a new record. “It’s very quick, particularly as there was no icebreaker escort which previously there had been in journeys,” said Bill Spears, spokesman for the shipping company which owns the tanker, Sovcomflot. “It’s very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round.” While the rapid journey time is in part due to the innovative technology, it also illustrates the extent to which climate change has melted some of the ice. Earlier this year it was reported that \\"polar heatwaves\\" had shrunk the icecaps down to an all-time low. ||||| Climate change has thawed Arctic enough for 300m gas tanker to travel at record speed through northern sea route A Russian tanker has travelled through the northern sea route in record speed and without an icebreaker escort for the first time, highlighting how climate change is opening up the high Arctic. The 300m (£233m) Christophe de Margerie carried a cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Hammerfest in Norway to Boryeong in South Korea in 19 days, about 30% quicker than the conventional southern shipping route through the Suez Canal. The tanker was built to take advantage of the diminishing Arctic sea ice and deliver gas from a new 27m facility on the Yamal Peninsula, the biggest Arctic LNG project so far which has been championed by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Murmansk's silver lining: Arctic city expects renaissance with ice melt Read more On its maiden voyage, the innovative tanker used its integral icebreaker to cross ice fields 1.2m thick, passing along the northern sea section of the route in the Russian Arctic in a record six-and-a-half days. “It’s very quick, particularly as there was no icebreaker escort which previously there had been in journeys,” said Bill Spears, spokesperson for Sovcomflot, the shipping company which owns the tanker. “It’s very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round.” Environmentalists have expressed concern over the risks of increased ship traffic in the pristine Arctic but Sovcomflot stressed the tanker’s green credentials. As well as using conventional fuel, the Christophe de Margerie can be powered by the LNG it is transporting, reducing its sulphur oxide emissions by 90% and nitrous oxide emissions by 80% when powered this way. “This is a significant factor in a fragile ecosystem,” said Spears. The northern sea route between Siberia and the Pacific is still closed to conventional shipping for much of the year. But the Christophe de Margerie, the first of 15 such tankers expected to be built, extends the navigation window for the northern sea route from four months with an expensive icebreaker to all year round in a westerly direction. In the route’s busiest year so far, 2013, there were only 15 international crossings but the Russian government predicts that cargo along this route will grow tenfold by 2020. This link with the Pacific reduces its need to sell gas through pipelines to Europe. “There has been a steady increase in traffic in recent years,” said Spears. “There’s always been trade along this route but it’s been restricted a lot by the ice. It’s exciting that this route presents a much shorter alternative than the Suez route. It’s a major saving.” Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said that shipping companies were making a “safe bet” in building ships in anticipation that the northern sea route will open up. “Even if we stopped greenhouse emissions tomorrow, the acceleration in the loss of Arctic ice is unlikely to be reversed,” he said. “We’ve been able to sail through the north-west passage for several years now but the northern passage, which goes past Russia, has opened up on and off since 2010. We’re going to see this route being used more and more by 2020. “The irony is that one advantage of climate change is that we will probably use less fuel going to the Pacific.” The extent of Arctic ice fell to a new wintertime low in March this year after freakishly high temperatures in the polar regions, and hit its second lowest summer extent last September. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A Russian gas tanker has traveled through the Arctic without an icebreaker escort for the first time due to climate change, which has melted some of the ice.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia. An 81-year-old woman has been ordered to repay more than 500,000 in falsely claimed Centrelink benefits. Pauline Mitchell has been ordered to repay more than half-a-million dollars in Centrelink benefits she claimed over a 30-year-period on behalf of her dead brother and sister. The 81-year-old from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, was ordered to repay the government more than 514,000, which she has received in the names of her dead siblings, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last week. The tribunal is investigating whether Mrs Mitchell, who also goes by her married name Pauline Crowhurst and her mother's maiden name Pauline Henning, will have to repay a further 219,000 based on false reporting of assets to Centrelink. Mrs Mitchell received 292,000 for pensions in the name of her brother Kenneth between 1984 and August 2010, despite the fact he died at sea in 1942 during active service in the Second World War. She also claimed 231,000 in pension benefits for Mary Mitchell, the legal name of her older sister also called Marie or Maria, who died in 1983. Payments to Mrs Mitchell and her deceased siblings were stopped in August 2010 and Australian Federal Police raided Mrs Mitchell's houses at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and in Asquith, in northern Sydney in September 2010. Police found bank account details and key cards for Kenneth and Mary Mitchell. Mrs Mitchell claimed that her brother Kenneth had not died in the war and she met him in a park in the 1980s and saw him again in 2005. She insisted that Mary Mitchell was Kenneth's wife and that she had been withdrawing money from their accounts at their request, which she would leave on a table in the shed for them to collect. Mrs Mitchell has been receiving pensions for her deceased brother since 1984 and for her deceased sister since 1990. Mrs Mitchell was also ruled to have 'told untruths' and deliberately failed to reveal her assets to Centrelink over the last thirty years, failing to tell them about four properties she owned in Kangy Angy on the central coast of NSW, Asquith and Wentworth Falls. At various times over the last few decades she told Centrelink officials that she lived 'in the National Park in the Blue Mountains by a river', in a caravan, and that she was homeless. Senior Member of the AAT Geri Ettinger ruled that 'much of Mrs Mitchell's evidence [was] less than credible' including her claims that she had suffered serious memory loss after being thrown from a horse in 1994. Mrs Mitchell also claimed that she did not tell Centrelink about her living arrangements because her three daughters had been abducted from her in 1968, after she separated from her husband and she 'lived in fear' of a second abduction. She also said that she had moved from her home in Asquith because there was a prostitute living downstairs.

No; The suggested answer does not provide an accurate or specific time frame of when America was pioneered. America was pioneered much earlier than the 19th century mentioned in the given answer.

Over time, the continent was progressively colonized, and exploration and settlement took place throughout different periods in history. While it is true that the 19th-century expansion was driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, this does not address the question asked about when America was pioneered. The pioneering process and the colonization of the continent spanned centuries and involved various waves of migration and settlement, starting from the early settlers in the 17th century (such as the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620 and the establishment of the first English colony, Jamestown, in 1607), through the westward migration of the 19th century.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

The New York Times But the ceremony also reflected something of the spirit of entrepreneurship now reawakening in Nablus, a city of about 150,000 people that was once considered the commercial center of the West Bank. The wedding was the brainchild of Muhannad Rabi, 37, the manager of a real estate development and investment company in the city, the fourth public event he has arranged. “I want to market Nablus,” Mr. Rabi said. Struggling to make himself heard above the cheering audience and the singer belting out Arabic wedding favorites, Mr. Rabi said he started a year ago with a festival at which residents baked what he said was the world’s biggest knafeh, a sweet local pastry. A marathon was next, then a soccer match between authority politicians and residents. He took his idea for a communal wedding to the Palestinian Authority governor of the district, who approved it and brought in the mayor. Mr. Rabi said he wanted to “convey a message to the world that we in Nablus, and Palestine in general, can live as human beings, enjoy life and achieve our political goals.” For years after the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, Nablus was ruled by rival militias and criminal gangs, whose members roamed the streets. Hamas won municipal elections in the city and parliamentary elections across the West Bank and Gaza in 2006. But in June 2007, after the Islamic group seized full control of Gaza, militiamen associated with Mr. Abbas’s Fatah party rampaged through Nablus, looting and burning offices and institutions affiliated with Hamas and storming City Hall. That same year, the Palestinian Authority made Nablus the pilot for its law-and-order program, deploying hundreds of newly trained Palestinian police officers in the city. Palestinian officials said at the time that they wanted to deal first with the “head of the snake.” Now some of the Israeli checkpoints that used to surround the city have been removed, while others are run in a relaxed fashion, if they are staffed at all. The city is open to visitors from all over the West Bank, as well as to Arabs from Israel. In the streets, new cars, including sport utility vehicles, point to growing prosperity. The Nablus Muqata, the authority headquarters destroyed by the Israelis during the second intifada, is being rebuilt. The new mood is personified by people like Atallah and Khamis al-Sairafi, 49, identical twins and entrepreneurs who were born to refugees from Jaffa, now in Israel, and grew up in the Askar refugee camp on the edge of Nablus. A somewhat comical pair — they say they wake up in their separate homes and telepathically end up wearing identical outfits — they started out in the scrap metal business. But just before the second intifada, they bought a disused Boeing 707 passenger jet and parked it in an amusement park they had built along a road east of the city. They had planned to turn it into a restaurant. After the violence broke out, the amusement park became a makeshift Israeli Army camp, and the plane sat corroding next to a derelict Ferris wheel, birds flapping in and out of its broken windows and doors. Now the Sairafi brothers say they are negotiating with the Nablus municipality to move the plane to a new park in the city, on the peak of Mount Ebal. They envision tables inside for more than a hundred diners, and singers performing on the wings. In the meantime they have opened a garbage recycling plant that they say is the “first in Palestine.” Even in the city’s Balata refugee camp, once an infamous hotbed of militancy, there are signs of change. The camp’s 25,000 residents were given a questionnaire by Fatah asking them to rank the projects they most wanted to see built. Their first choice, a public garden, opened early this year. The issue of improvement in the refugee camps has always been a delicate one. The Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants are careful about impressions of permanence, sticking to their demand for a right of return to their former homes in what is now Israel. But Ahmad Douqan, leader of the camp’s committee, said the refugees “never refused offers of help.” “Being a refugee does not mean that I should live with unpaved roads and sewage running in the streets,” Mr. Douqan said. The authority has also approved a major electricity project for Balata, and Mr. Douqan said the government wanted to help build the camp’s first wedding hall, to make marriage more affordable. For the 47 couples at the communal wedding, finance was also a major factor. The city still has many poor residents, and a wedding can cost about 5,000. As well as the party in the amphitheater, the organizers paid for the wedding dresses and a three-day honeymoon in the Jordanian resort of Aqaba, and gave the couples gifts of furniture and cash. Amid the dancing and fireworks, there were reminders of the more turbulent past. The youngest groom, Mufid al-Aqad, 21, who was marrying his 19-year-old cousin, lost his brother, a militant, in an armed clash with Israeli soldiers in 2004. Mr. Assayes, the sculptor, spent several years in Israeli jails for what he described as “defending my home.” Surveying the scene from the side of the stage, he said he felt proud.

Pre-K on the Starting Blocks Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to offer full-day preschool to every New York City 4-year-old hasn’t yet rounded the corner from election slogan to classroom reality. But it’s moving: a public-relations campaign on Friday started blitzing the city with leaflets and emails to drum up support for the tax to pay for it. The mayor has assembled early-education experts to design the program and has been seeking support from legislators. He’s even won a (backhanded) endorsement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said in his State of the State address that he wants universal preschool for the entire state. While Mr. Cuomo seems content with an applause line in a wish list, Mr. de Blasio is on the hook with a deeper commitment. He has said how he will pay for it, how much it will cost and that it will begin late this year. His preschool plan (and a separate after-school program for middle-schoolers) relies on the State Legislature raising income taxes on city residents making 500,000 and above. He calls this a negligible sacrifice for a transformative social good. Even so, its prospects are unclear, given Mr. Cuomo’s recent fervor for cutting taxes. Leaving aside the financing uncertainties, the mayor is on solid pedagogical ground. Full-day prekindergarten is a smart investment in growing minds, preparing children to be skilled learners at a moment when they are primed for it. It’s better to reach them at age 4 rather than fixing their learning problems later. Across the country, lawmakers and educators have embraced the universal preschool movement. President Obama has made a similar case. Mr. de Blasio is making a mainstream argument, though on a bigger scale than anyone else. The city has about 100,000 4-year-olds. Mr. de Blasio wants to reach 68,000 of them: 48,000 new students on top of the 20,000 who have full-day public preschool now. Children in private programs would be able to attend the city’s free classes if they wish. This will be expensive: 340 million a year, plus 190 million for the after-school program. But if the plan is executed halfheartedly, as an underfinanced form of babysitting, it’s not worth doing. (This is why Mr. de Blasio argues for a dedicated tax, saying yearly appropriations battles would leave too much uncertainty about financing, discouraging a full commitment from teachers and staff needed to make the program work.) One challenge will be finding the physical space to teach all these 4-year-olds, either by expanding existing programs or building new ones. This may require Mr. de Blasio to put aside his antipathy to charter schools, many of which would be well-positioned to add preschools, though state law would have to be changed to allow this. Then the city will have to persuade parents to sign up, make sure there is a qualified teaching corps with classes small enough to be effective, and tightly integrate the program with kindergarten through third grade so that 4-year-olds do not lose their momentum. It will have to prepare children well for the rigorous Common Core learning standards that promise to bring their math, science and literacy skills up to international norms. The key, Mr. de Blasio’s aides say, is creating a meaningful, high-quality learning experience as they build to scale. Skeptics may say that the benefits of preschool tend not to last, but that doesn’t have to be true, if done right and sustained by good schooling in later years.

It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000., North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham.

Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\"., Laurence Sterne (24 November 1713 18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an Anglican clergyman.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Okay, so you got fired. You got dumped. You injured your leg. Does this mean you should look for a new job, join OkCupid, or start training for a marathon ASAP? Of course not. Give your situation a little bit of time until you feel calm enough to make a rational decision. Obviously, you should start looking for new work sooner than you should start training for a race with an injured leg, but you get the picture. If you try to solve the problem directly after the setback, you're likely to make a decision out of desperation and despair, not from a rational standpoint. Watch the entire first season of The Killing. Take a long walk every day for a week. Don't do anything that would make you wallow or be upset, but clear your mind, do something different, and start to heal. This is another important part of dealing with disappointment. You can't keep thinking that the world is completely unfair, and that what happened to you was completely horrible. Okay, so maybe it was, but it happened, and there's nothing you can do to make it un-happen. It was in the past, and this is your present. And if you want to have a better future, then you have to accept the past for what it was, however unpleasant it may be. Obviously, you need to \\"practice\\" acceptance because it won't happen overnight. Let's say your husband cheated on you -- are you going to \\"accept\\" that overnight? Obviously not, but you can come to a place where thinking about it no longer leaves you feeling completely angry and bitter. Sure, hanging out with Mom or your best friend Mindy might not help you improve your career or find a new place to live, but it can make you feel better about the process. You'll see that you have so many great relationships in your life, and that you have an awesome support system that can help you through it all. Though you don't have to rehash the disappointment with everyone, just having them there will make you feel like you're not so alone with your pain. Don't force yourself into loud social outings if you're not feeling up to it; hang out with your friends and family in low-key settings. The old plan didn't work out for you, did it? That's perfectly okay. Ships have to change courses in the middle of the night all the time to avoid unforeseen obstacles, and so will you. Find a new way to get to that dream career, to find that perfect man, or to make your dream charity come to life. Maybe you've had a setback in your health and won't be able to walk for a few months. Work with a physical therapist to make a plan for success. Take a look at your life in a new way. How can you still follow your dreams, make yourself happy, but move things around? Talk to people who know what they're doing. If you're a teacher who is struggling with your job, talk to the principal. If you're trying to make it as an artist, see if there are other artists in your city who will be willing to offer some insight. Call a family friend who knows something about having to relocate to an unpleasant location for a job. Talk to your mom about what it was like when she went through her divorce. Though every situation is different, getting advice from different people (provided that you trust them), will give you more direction and will make you see that plenty of other people are struggling, too. So you may not become director of the writing program at your small college. But there's a new reading series that opened up and they want you to be in charge. Dash at the opportunity to do something new that can give you experience, help you work with a variety of people, and give you more confidence about achieving your goals. If you only want to do thing A, B, or C, then you'll be turning a blind eye when opportunity Z, the best opportunity of all, struts right by you. A new person can be a new opportunity, too. Don't close off and hang out with the same circle of friends; a new friend can bring new momentum and energy to your life. Maybe you've only looked for work as a high school teacher and just can't get a break. Why not try something different but related, like teaching community college? It can still be a great opportunity that will give you the experience you need. The Nobel-Prize-winning author, Alice Munro, didn't publish a book until she was 37, Steve Jobs was a college dropout, and Matthew McConaughey cleaned chicken coops before he became a star. Look at the lives of other people who dealt with major disappointments before coming out the other end with more guts and more appreciation for what they have. If success was served up on a silver platter, then it wouldn't be worth the struggle, would it? Summary:","completion":"Facing disappointments such as job loss, broken relationships, or physical setbacks can be challenging but it's important to give yourself time to process the situation and make rational decisions. Seek comfort from friends and family to help you through your tough times and don't be afraid to discuss your challenges with others who may offer valuable insights or advice. Be open to new opportunities, even if they deviate from your original plan, as they can provide enriching experiences and help build your confidence towards achieving your goals. Be open to meeting new people and considering alternative paths, and remember that many successful people faced major disappointments before achieving their ultimate success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Showrooming One of the biggest challenges facing brick-and-mortar retailers in recent years has been the \\"showrooming\\".Driven by the desire to get the best prices, many shoppers are now visiting brick-and-mortar stores to personally check on products that interest them, only to leave and then buy the items online.The new trend is forcing retailers to find out new ways to keep consumers from leaving their store for cheaper prices online. Recent research found that 40 percent of U.S.shoppers have showroomed previously, with big-box retailers suffering the most.Specifically, the study shows that Best Buy, Walmart and Target are the most likely brick-and-mortar stores to have shoppers test out a product in-store and then purchase it online later, while Amazon is benefiting most from the practice, with nearly 60 percent of shoppers using the online retail giant most often to make their showrooming purchases. Smartphones have pushed showrooming into the front.Shoppers no longer have to wait until they get home to see if they can find a cheaper price for the products they're considering buying.With smartphones, consumers can now compare virtual prices, at both other brick-and-mortar stores and online ones while still inside a retail store.If they can find what they're seeking for less online, the majority will be seeking the first exit.A recent study showed that 45 percent of customers shopping at brick-and-mortar stores walk out and buy their purchase online for a discount of as little as 2.5 percent. This puts pressure on retailers to provide both an in-store experience worth staying for and an online presence that can attract shoppers who are showrooming in other businesses. To cut down on showrooming, many retailers are adopting new methods to keep shoppers in their stores.Among the steps they're taking are price-matching guarantees that allow shoppers to pay a discounted price if they find it cheaper online.This ensures that even a showrooming shopper can make the purchase in the store--regardless of whether...

The kangaroo hopped over the truck.","completion":"The sentence \\"The kangaroo hopped over the truck.\\" is indeed linguistically acceptable. In this analysis, I will break down various components of the sentence to explain why it meets the criteria for a well-formed and understandable linguistic structure. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules in a language for the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. In this sentence, the structure follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) format of English sentences. The subject is the kangaroo, the verb is hopped, and the object is the truck. This proper structure allows for a clear understanding of the intended meaning. 2. Morphology: Morphology is the aspect of language pertaining to the forms of words. The words used in this sentence are morphologically sound, as they are all recognizable and correctly formed according to English morphological rules. The noun \\"kangaroo\\" is in its singular form, the verb \\"hopped\\" is in its simple past tense, and the nouns \\"the\\" and \\"truck\\" are in their standard forms. 3. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In this sentence, the meaning is clear and can be easily understood by readers or listeners. The sentence presents a scenario where a kangaroo is hopping over a truck. The action (hopping) performed by the kangaroo (the subject) is directed towards the truck (the object), creating a clear relationship between the action and the object involved in the action. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is the study of how context contributes to the interpretation and understanding of meaning in language. The given sentence does not provide extensive context, but its meaning can still be inferred. For those familiar with kangaroos and their ability to hop, the sentence is plausible. Kangaroos are known for their exceptional jumping abilities, so it is not unreasonable to imagine a situation where a kangaroo could hop over a truck, although it might be an extraordinary event. 5. Vocabulary: The vocabulary used in the sentence is standard English. Each word is understandable and conveys the intended meaning. The sentence does not include any jargon, slang, or obscure words that might hinder comprehension. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The kangaroo hopped over the truck.\\" is linguistically acceptable. It follows the syntactic rules and structure of the English language, the words are morphologically well-formed, the meaning is clear, the context is understandable, and the vocabulary is standard English. While it might be an unusual or extraordinary event, it is linguistically sound and conveys a clear message to its audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

OK... this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike (although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film-makers, and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics) so I wanted to sit in Guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it. The film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is. This has been described many times as as making the film \\"inaccessible\\" to the viewer. The film's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle (or not so subtle) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory, IE. Ray Liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words \\"fear me\\" is portrayed as both tragically pathetic (from Statham's POV) or interrogating and bold (from Liotta's POV). This is but one example of Ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with Revolver, we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal (the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption... I mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys, all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs) but then Guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points. Take the scene where Jason Statham's character runs afoul of a car. This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever... but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death. So the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling, I'd be taking the p*ss if I said I didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going \\"uh... wtf?\\"... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art. It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand. And even easier to say \\"well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film!\\". In my humble opinion, Revolver is a stylish, complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers. If we choose this opportunity to collectively say \\"Ah sh*t, I wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in-nit loll... Guy Ritchie is a tit!\\" then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow, crappy people. Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being \\"pretentious\\". Funny people can be thoughtful too. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer recognizes the complexity and non-linear chronology of the film, and appreciates Guy Ritchie's mature approach to filmmaking in Revolver. They acknowledge that the film may be difficult to understand but argue that this shouldn't be a reason to disregard it. Instead, they praise Revolver as a stylish, complex, and mature piece of modern art. While they mention some confusion during the final act of the movie, they emphasize the importance of not dismissing the film because of its challenging nature. Overall, the reviewer expresses support for Guy Ritchie and his decision to venture into a different, more philosophical realm with this film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"\\"Don't You Want Somebody to Love\\" is a song that was recorded by the American rock band, Jefferson Airplane. The lead vocals for this track was primarily performed by Grace Slick, who was the band's lead singer and songwriter. This song was a part of the 1967 album 'Surrealistic Pillow,' which is often recognized as one of the key records from the Summer of Love and the burgeoning counterculture movement of the 1960s. Grace Slick was a pivotal member of Jefferson Airplane, joining the band in 1966 and staying with them until 1972, before continuing with several other iterations of the band such as Jefferson Starship and Starship. Known for her strong and evocative vocals as well as her songwriting abilities, Slick played a key role in defining the psychedelic rock sound that Jefferson Airplane came to be associated with. She was particularly well-known for her meaningful lyricism, and \\"Don't You Want Somebody to Love\\" was no exception. It was a defining song of the countercultural era, with lyrics that spoke to the yearning for human connection amidst the social and political upheaval of the times. The song is characterized by Slick's powerful and bluesy vocals, as well as vivid, layered instrumentals featuring ripping guitar lines, haunting organ, and heavy, steady percussion. It has been considered a highlight of Jefferson Airplane's career and an iconic anthem of the 1960s, stirring listeners with its impassioned plea for love and understanding during a turbulent era in history.+"},{"prompt":"Q: The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful what?

Input: By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The projection is included in a 'skills barometer' it produced for Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning. Significant manufacturing job losses were announced over the last few days, including a Michelin factory closure. However, the centre expects the sector to add between 8,000 and 14,000 jobs by 2025. 'Skills shortages' Under the 'high growth' scenario, that would mean manufacturing jobs increasing by 16%. By contrast jobs in the sector fell by 21% between 1997 and 2007. The centre said growth will typically come in higher value manufacturing \\"driven by an increase in foreign direct investment\\". The report also looks at where there are likely to be skills shortages under the high growth scenario. It points to a \\"significant undersupply\\" of skilled graduates in engineering, maths, computer science and physical sciences. It also forecasts a significant shortage of non-graduates with engineering, manufacturing and science skills. The report cautions that a skills oversupply issue could arise if there is weak economic growth 'Work experience' However, it said that outcome is preferred to a shortage of skills which could constrain economic growth and result in higher levels of unemployment. An oversupply is forecast of graduates with qualifications in psychology and social work. The report makes a number of policy recommendations, including a greater focus on employability skills and more work experience for undergraduates. It also suggests that further education colleges provide too wide a range of services. It states that they could focus on \\"mid to high-level skills\\" with other providers delivering low-level skills training. Output:","completion":"The \\"skills barometer\\" report projects 8,000 to 14,000 new manufacturing jobs by 2025, but warns of potential skills shortages in engineering, maths, computer science, and physical sciences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 58*k - 7*k + 153 = 0 for k, we first need to simplify the equation by combining like terms. We have two terms with the variable k: 58*k and -7*k. Step 1: Combine like terms: (58*k - 7*k) + 153 = 0 (51*k) + 153 = 0 Now we have 51*k + 153 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable k: To isolate k, we need to get the term with k alone on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. First, we can subtract 153 from both sides of the equation: 51*k + 153 - 153 = 0 - 153 51*k = -153 Step 3: Solve for k: Now, to get k alone, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 51: 51*k / 51 = -153 / 51 k = -3 And the answer is k = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: \\"The 1987 record \\"\\"La Bamba\\"\\" was by which artist?\\"","completion":"The 1987 record \\"La Bamba\\" is by the artist Los Lobos, an American rock band from East Los Angeles, California. Los Lobos, which means \\"The Wolves\\" in Spanish, was formed in 1973. The group originally consisted of vocalists and guitarists David Hidalgo and Louie Pérez, bassist and vocalist Conrad Lozano, and drummer and vocalist Cesar Rosas. Later on, saxophonist and keyboardist Steve Berlin joined the lineup. Los Lobos rose to fame with their major-label debut album \\"How Will the Wolf Survive?\\" in 1984. Although they had already released an independent album in 1978, their more polished sound in the 1984 album attracted widespread attention and critical acclaim. Nevertheless, it was their interpretation of the traditional Mexican folk song \\"La Bamba\\" that would bring them global recognition. In 1987, Los Lobos was approached to contribute to the soundtrack of the biographical film \\"La Bamba,\\" which was based on the life of Ritchie Valens, a Mexican-American rock-and-roll pioneer who died tragically in a plane crash at the age of 17. Valens had released his own version of \\"La Bamba\\" in 1958, which was a hit that helped popularize Latin American music in the United States. Los Lobos's rendition of \\"La Bamba\\" captured the spirit of Valens's recording by combining elements of rock, Tex-Mex, and traditional Mexican music. The Los Lobos version features an upbeat tempo, complete with infectious guitar riffs and a lively accordion backing, which adds an authentic Mexican touch to the song. This cover of \\"La Bamba\\" was an enormous hit, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, the UK Singles Chart, and various charts around the world, solidifying its place as an iconic pop culture moment. The Los Lobos version garnered numerous awards and accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Los Lobos's success with \\"La Bamba\\" helped to highlight the contributions of Mexican-American musicians to the overall American music scene. However, the band did not want to be pigeonholed as just a Latin rock group. Over their long career, Los Lobos has consistently experimented with various musical genres, including blues, rock, R&B, and traditional Mexican music, with influences from many world cultures. Their willingness to explore diverse sonic realms, while constantly challenging and evolving, has earned Los Lobos respect and admiration from fans and fellow musicians alike. To sum up, the 1987 record \\"La Bamba\\" is by Los Lobos, a versatile and highly acclaimed American rock band that played a significant role in elevating Latin American music within the broader US musical landscape. The widespread success of their rendition of Ritchie Valens's \\"La Bamba\\" can be attributed to its infectious rhythm, lively instrumentation, and heartfelt tribute to a pioneering Mexican-American musician."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the tactics Weiss used with daughter Bea: depriving her of dinner because she ate 800 calories at school during \\"French Heritage Day,\\" refusing to allow her to participate in \\"Pizza Fridays\\" because she once added a corn salad on the side, and angrily dumping out her Starbucks hot chocolate when the barista couldn't tell her exactly how many calories it contained.

That's like the weight of around 60 to 80 toy cars! Bea's mommy didn't just stop her from having ice cream, she also didn't let Bea eat dinner one day because Bea had eaten a lot during a school day called \\"French Heritage Day\\".

Once, Bea’s mommy even emptied her Starbucks hot chocolate because the person who made it couldn’t tell her mommy exactly how many calories it had. However, not everyone thought Bea's mommy was right. A lady named Katie Baker wrote on a website called Jezebel about how she thought Bea's mommy wasn't very nice to her own child. Katie felt that Bea's mommy was like one of the meanest women in the world. Dhani Mau on Fashionista.com said Bea's mommy might not seem very normal or reasonable to people who were reading her story. He was not very happy when Bea’s mom stopped her from eating a dish called salad nicoise, like how you might feel if someone came between you and your favorite toy. Another mommy, who chose to have her identity hidden, thought Bea's mommy was harsh because she didn't try to figure out why Bea was eating a lot. Instead, she felt Bea's mommy was unkindly putting her own unhappiness about her body onto Bea. She thought Bea's mommy had shown Bea a direction which might lead her to develop unhealthy ways of thinking about food and body weight when she grows up.

Q: CONTEXT: 25 de noviembre de 2010 En reacción a las presiones ejercidas por la Unión Europea (UE) sobre Suiza, un comité de la Suiza alemana lanzó esta semana una iniciativa popular que demanda el congelamiento de las negociaciones para la adhesión del país, exigiendo que dicha adhesión no ocurra, por lo menos, en los próximos 10 años. El comité ahora tendrá 18 meses para recoger las 100.000 firmas necesarias para presentar el proyecto. Los miembros del comité se presentaron el martes ante la prensa. Compuesto únicamente de miembros alemanes del Partido Liberal Radical (PLR) y la Unión Democrática del Centro (UDC), el comité, que se define como \\"políticamente independiente\\", es dirigido por el diputado del Cantón de Zúrich, Hans-Peter Portmann. Los miembros del comité manifestaron durante la conferencia de prensa que habían lanzado esta iniciativa luego de declaraciones de la UE –según las cuales los acuerdos bilaterales no tendrían futuro alguno–, y de presiones y \\"medidas discriminatorias\\" tomadas, según explicó Portmann, por ciertos países de la UE, \\"entre ellos Italia, con el propósito de lograr poco a poco una adhesión de facto de Suiza a la Unión Europea\\". Así, el comité se opone a la transferencia automática del acervo comunitario exigido por las autoridades políticas europeas. Agregaron, asimismo, que la iniciativa tiene un doble propósito: presionar al Consejo Federal Suizo para que se oponga a todo nuevo acuerdo que acerque a Suiza a la UE, pero también lograr que los partidos políticos de derecho a tomen cartas en el asunto, a los cuales acusó de oponerse \\"la adhesión pero que aún deben probar que su oposición no se reduce a palabras vacías\\". A pesar de la falta de apoyo de grandes organizaciones, los iniciantes confían en que reunirán las 100.000 firmas necesarias para presentar la iniciativa, tarea para la cual tienen tiempo hasta el 23 de mayo de 2012. Cuentan, en efecto, con que el tema de la relación entre Suiza y la UE será forzosamente abordado durante las elecciones federales de 2011. La hazaña no será fácil, sin embargo, dada la negativa expresa del resto del PLR y de la UDC de sostener el proyecto: mientras que el primero considera la iniciativa como \\"inútil\\" vista la moratoria de facto sobre el proyecto, el segundo considera que es sólo una operación publicitaria \\"de los radicales de Zúrich para recuperar a los oponentes a la adhesión de la UE\\".

The city lies on the River Soar and at the edge of the National Forest. - Lisson Grove is a district and a street of the City of Westminster, London, just to the north of the city ring road. There are many landmarks surrounding the area. To the north is Lord's Cricket Ground in St John's Wood. To the west are Little Venice, Paddington and Watling Street. To the north east is Primrose Hill and south east is Marylebone, which includes the railway station and Dorset Square, the original home of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Contemporary art includes, and develops from, postmodern art, which is itself a successor to modern art. In vernacular English, \\"modern\\" and \\"contemporary\\" are synonyms, resulting in some conflation of the terms \\"modern art\\" and \\"contemporary art\\" by non-specialists. - Conceptual art, sometimes simply called conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print: - Hornsey College of Art (a.k.a. Hornsey School of Art) is a former college centred on Crouch End in the London Borough of Haringey, England. The HCA was \\"an iconic British art institution, renowned for its experimental and progressive approach to art and design education\\". - Sir Anish Kapoor, CBE RA, (born 12 March 1954) is a British-Indian sculptor.

The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - After the May 12, 2008, earthquake in the Chinese province of Sichuan, there was a series of allegations of corruption against officials involved in the construction of schools in regions affected by the quake. It gained momentum in May and June 2008, and the allegations culminated in protests from grieving parents of children who died in the earthquake as a result of the collapse of various schools in the quake zone. - Solomon \\"Sol\\" LeWitt (September 9, 1928 April 8, 2007) was an American artist linked to various movements, including Conceptual art and Minimalism. - Lisson Gallery is a contemporary art gallery in Bell Street , Lisson Grove , London , founded by Nicholas Logsdail and Fiona Hildyard in 1967 . The gallery represents around 40 artists such as Richard Long , John Latham , Sol LeWitt , Robert Mangold , Jonathan Monk , Julian Opie , Richard Wentworth , Anish Kapoor , Richard Deacon and Ai Weiwei . - Julian Opie (born 1958) is a visual artist of the New British Sculpture movement. - Ai Weiwei (; born 28 August 1957 in Beijing) is a Chinese Contemporary artist and activist. His father's side's original surname is Jiang. Ai collaborated with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron as the artistic consultant on the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics. As a political activist, he has been highly and openly critical of the Chinese Government's stance on democracy and human rights. He has investigated government corruption and cover-ups, in particular the Sichuan schools corruption scandal following the collapse of so-called \\"tofu-dreg schools\\" in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In 2011, following his arrest at Beijing Capital International Airport on 3 April, he was held for 81 days without any official charges being filed; officials alluded to their allegations of \\"economic crimes\\". - Christopher Nicholas Roald Logsdail OBE (born 1945) is a British art dealer, the owner of the Lisson Gallery, a contemporary art gallery on Bell Street, Lisson Grove, London, founded by Logsdail and Fiona Hildyard in 1967.

Founded by Nicholas Logsdail and Fiona Hildyard in 1967, the gallery has established itself as a prominent space for showcasing artists specializing in various disciplines, including Conceptual art, Minimalism, and the New British Sculpture movement. The City of Westminster is a borough in London that encompasses several well-known areas and landmarks, such as Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and Regent's Park. As a result, the relationship between the Lisson Gallery and the City of Westminster is primarily geographical, as the art gallery is situated within the boundaries of the borough.

Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. But I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. What is an answer for this question: Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bottle B would be coagulated. In this situation, Dan has collected three bottles of milk: bottle A and bottle B, which contain pasteurized milk, and bottle C, which contains raw milk. He made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk, keeping the milk in bottle A intact. Curds are formed when milk is coagulated, which results from adding an acidic substance (such as lemon juice, vinegar, or rennet) or by allowing the milk to sour naturally by introducing lactic acid bacteria. During this coagulation process, the milk proteins, mainly casein, tangle into solid masses, forming curds. Since Dan made curd out of bottle B milk, it underwent coagulation, forming the curds he desired for his experiment. On the other hand, the milk in bottle A remained pasteurized and intact, without being subjected to the coagulation or curdling process. Therefore, bottle B milk would be coagulated, whereas bottle A milk would remain in its original pasteurized state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Meanwhile the protests there have only got stronger, with the added celebrity backing of stars such as singer Kanye West this week. The Occupy Wall Street demonstrators marched to. the home of JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday - and today are gathering at the firm's headquarters in New York to protest. The arrests in Chicago came one day after thousands of people including teachers and religious leaders marched and snarled rush-hour traffic while protesting unemployment and economic woes.

The group unfurled upside-down flags and anti-war banners in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, which houses senators' personal offices and some committee rooms. They chanted ‘We are the 99 per cent’ - reflecting their view that the country's wealthiest one per cent have too much and are too powerful - and ‘Stop the wars’ until Capitol police cleared the area. The protest had been planned for months by such anti-war groups as Veterans for Peace and Code Pink to mark the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan. However the event drew participants as well from the Occupy DC protest, a local version of the anti-corporate Occupy Wall Street demonstrations that have spread nationwide. On the floor: This protestor was one of around 100 arrested early on Tuesday morning after police cracked down on an Occupy Boston camp. Grabbed: These protesters were taken away from a section of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Parkway. Force required: Many of the protesters refused to move from the camp and had to be forcibly removed by cops. Grounded: Protesters are arrested in Boston, after tensions boiled over on Tuesday morning when police arrested about 100 protesters from the Occupy Boston movement after the group expanded its camp. It comes after a huge crackdown on Occupy Boston’s second campsite that saw about 100 protesters arrested and their tents and personal belongings reportedly thrown into bins on Monday night. They were arrested on Monday morning around 1:30am after they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, police said. The protesters, part of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, had tried to expand from their original site in Dewey Square to a second site across the street, along the Rose Kennedy Greenway. A local conservancy group recently planted 150,000 worth of shrubs along the greenway and officials said they were concerned about damage. The arrests were mostly for trespassing. Police had warned protesters for hours they would have to return to Dewey Square, where a tent city has been steadily growing, and issued leaflets saying protesters could not occupy the greenway.

The hypothesis, which assumes the man is trying to get his cat out of the tree, is just one of many possible explanations that might align with the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need more context or information about the situation. For instance, if we had information such as observing a cat stuck in the tree or the man expressing concern about reaching his cat, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is supported by the evidence. Several alternative scenarios could also fit the given premise: 1. The man might be picking fruits or nuts from the tree using the long pole. This would be a more plausible explanation if the tree is of a fruit-bearing or nut-bearing species. 2. The man could be attempting to remove an unwanted object stuck in the tree, such as a kite or a ball that may have been caught in the branches during play. 3. The man might be performing maintenance, such as pruning or trimming branches to maintain the tree's health or appearance. 4. The man could be trying to knock down a beehive or wasp nest from the tree, either to obtain honey or to address a safety concern surrounding the insects. In conclusion, the premise alone does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true.

Question: A racehorse and a horse drawn carriage both depart from a saloon at the same time. The horse drawn carriage is twenty times slower than the racehorse. Which will arrive last at the next town? (A) the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town (B) the racehorse will take more time to arrive at the next town A:","completion":"(A) the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town Let's examine the context and factors contributing to the difference in the time of arrival between a horse-drawn carriage and a racehorse: 1. Speed: It's stated that the horse drawn carriage is twenty times slower than the racehorse. This implies that if a racehorse covers a certain distance in one unit of time, it will take the horse drawn carriage twenty units of time to cover the same distance. It would mean that the racehorse can move considerably quicker than the horse drawn carriage and thus cover more ground in a lesser amount of time. 2. Efficiency: A racehorse is specifically bred, trained, and conditioned to race at high speeds and cope with the demands of competitive racing. They are built for agility and endurance, allowing them to maintain a faster pace over extended periods. In contrast, the horse or horses pulling a carriage are not specialized for speed and are tasked with hauling the additional weight of the carriage and its passengers or cargo. These factors make it impossible for the horse drawn carriage to keep up with the racehorse in terms of efficiency. 3. Terrain: Even though the terrain may affect both the racehorse and the horse drawn carriage, heavier carriages are more likely to experience difficulty on uneven or challenging landscapes, slowing down their pace even further. A racehorse, being lighter and accustomed to overcoming obstacle courses in competitions, can easily maneuver through complex terrain with less trouble and time required, further widening the gap between the two modes of transport. 4. Rest and maintenance: A racehorse may require less frequent breaks than a horse drawn carriage due to their heightened physical conditioning. Horses used for pulling carriages may require more frequent stops for rest, food, and water due to the energy that is exerted in carrying the additional weight of the carriage. A racehorse can recover from fatigue at a quicker rate than a horse used for casual riding or pulling a carriage, allowing it to maintain a faster pace. Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town compared to the racehorse. The significant difference in speed, efficiency, adaptation to various terrains, and recovery from fatigue between the two makes the racehorse a far superior option in terms of reaching any destination quickly. Consequently, option (A) stating that the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town is the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Infolge der gewaltsamen ethnischen Konflikte und Spannungen, die in den 1990er Jahren in den ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republiken Kroatien, Bosnien und Herzegowina sowie dem später unabhängig gewordenen Kosovo ausgebrochen sind, haben zahlreiche Menschen ihr Zuhause verlassen und Schutz in anderen Teilen Serbiens gesucht. Für eine große Anzahl von ihnen wurde die Vojvodina-Region, die sich im Norden Serbiens befindet, zur neuen Heimat. Die Vojvodina-Region ist geographisch weit entfernt von den Konfliktzonen und hat eine reiche Landwirtschaft und ein multiethnisches Umfeld, was sie zu einem attraktiven Ziel für Flüchtlinge macht. Hier haben viele bosnische Serben, kroatische Serben und Serben aus dem Kosovo Zuflucht gefunden.

However, these sentences have been rephrased to present the information differently: 1. In the first sentence, the subject's name is \\"Zika,\\" which seems to be a typo of the intended name \\"Raonic.\\" The second sentence corrects this mistake and uses the correct name, \\"Raonic.\\" The first sentence also uses the incorrect term \\"Raonic virus\\" instead of \\"Zika virus,\\" which the second sentence rectifies. 2. The wordings in both sentences are different. The first sentence starts with \\"Zika decided not to play at the Summer Olympics in 2016\\", while the second one says, \\"Raonic decided not to play in the 2016 Summer Olympics\\". This is a change in the input structure and a reordering of the time reference and event. 3. The way the reason for non-participation is presented differs in both sentences. In the first sentence, the non-participation reason is given as \\"invoking health concerns and the Raonic virus.\\" The second sentence rephrases it as \\"citing health concerns and the Zika virus.\\" Both sentences convey the same idea but use different verb choices (i.e., invoking vs. citing). In conclusion, the two sentences are indeed paraphrases, as they convey the same information but present it using different structures, vocabulary, and presentation. Additionally, the second sentence corrects the mistakes in the first sentence, making it a more accurate representation of the intended message."},{"prompt":"Dialogue: M: Excuse me.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: After which victim does Jessica go to jail? had gone on a killing spree back in the 1970s and th A:","completion":"Title: \\"The Past Shadows\\" Step 1: Establish Main Characters Our main character is Jessica, a seemingly regular woman with a dark secret. The supporting characters include Detective Mike, who reopens cold cases, Sarah - Jessica's adult daughter oblivious to her mother's past, and Karen, a surviving victim of Jessica's past crimes. Step 2: Build the Story Setting The story is generally set in modern times but has flashbacks to the 1970s when Jessica was actively committing her crimes. Step 3: Start the Story The movie opens with Jessica, an aged woman leading a normal life, attending her grandson's school play. Martha, a younger Jessica in flashbacks, revels in her dark activities. The two timelines continue in parallel, slowly revealing Jessica's past. Step 4: The Discovery Detective Mike, who has a penchant for cold cases, stumbles upon unsolved killings from the 1970s. He finds connections between victims that lead to a single, yet unknown, perpetrator. Around the same time, Sarah uncovers some old belongings of Jessica hinting at her sinister past. Step 5: The Confrontation Detective Mike's investigations lead him to Karen, a surviving victim of Jessica's rampage. Karen confirms Jessica was her assaulter. Simultaneously, Sarah confronts Jessica about her discoveries, leaving Jessica panicked. Step 6: The Arrest Kindling her past persona's ruthlessness, Jessica tries to silence Karen and Sarah to guard her secret, this leads to an additional victim. Step 7: The Climax As Jessica contemplates her escape, Detective Mike and the police corner her. She tries to fight but is eventually overpowered and taken into custody, ending her days of liberation. To justify the answer to the question: Jessica goes to jail after attempting to make her daughter, Sarah her final victim, but failing. Her incarceration marks not only the resolution to a long-closed investigation but also the end of a horrifying chapter from the 1970s that had gone unnoticed. Step 8: The Resolution Sarah is left to come to terms with who her mother truly is, while Detective Mike finds closure in solving a case that had been closed for decades. This plot draws suspense and intrigue at every turn, driving home a chilling tale of secrets, revelations, and a haunting past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Parents should help children to build their confidence and achievements. Parents should also play the role of a friend as well as a teacher in children's education. Learning about math or reading isn't the only problem we face in school. Maybe we are having problems with teachers, classmates or other people. At this time we really need a person who is ready to hear what we are thinking. And the person should be you---my dear parents. If we have nobody to talk with, we will have more stress in our school life. Please listen to our worries. It's good for our study and health.

Option (a) involves moving the shuffleboard around on the water, which doesn't make much sense as it is a game meant to be played on a stable surface. Option (b) involves skating around the island on the water, but the men are already on a boat with a shuffleboard, so this option isn't relevant to the situation.

Monica hated cleaning the bird droppings off the car unlike Sarah because","completion":"Sarah was always fascinated by birds and the beautiful mess they left behind - almost like their personal signature on the world. Monica, on the other hand, found the mess that the birds left on her car to be both irritating and unsanitary. She couldn't understand Sarah's fascination with it, let alone her enjoyment in cleaning the droppings off. Monica's distaste grew with each passing day as more and more birds seemed to make a habit of perching on the sycamore tree above her car. On this particular day, she stepped outside to find her faithful, albeit old, gremlin green compact car absolutely plastered with the stuff - the windshield, the roof, the hood...the whole nine yards. Monica recoiled in disgust, knowing that she would be late to work if she took the time to clean everything off. \\"Why do they always target my car?\\" Monica mumbled under her breath, irritation seeping into her voice. \\"Think of it as a compliment,\\" Sarah piped up cheerily, already running to grab a bucket of water and some cleaning rags. She had been sitting on the porch, sipping on her morning coffee, and watching the birds perform their early feathered ballet in the air above them. \\"Birds are very particular about the places they choose to leave their mark.\\" Monica rolled her eyes, not at all believing that any part of this situation could be construed as a compliment. \\"No, seriously,\\" Sarah continued, coming back with the water and rags, \\"in many cultures, it's considered to be a sign of good luck when a bird leaves its droppings on your head or belongings.\\" Monica begrudgingly joined in the cleaning effort, more so to save time than to indulge Sarah's nonsense. \\"I don't see how this could possibly be considered lucky in any culture,\\" Monica grumbled as she scrubbed at a particularly stubborn stain on the hood. Sarah laughed, \\"Right, but think about it. The odds of being in the right place at the right time to have a bird release its droppings on you, or your car in this case, are astronomically small.\\" \\"That's true, I guess,\\" Monica conceded, still not completely sold on the idea of it being a good omen. She looked at her watch and was dismayed to find that she would be cutting it incredibly close to clock-in time, despite their cleaning efforts. \\"Ugh, I hate being late.\\" Sarah clapped her friend on the shoulder, an understanding smile in her eyes. She fetched her keys and tossed them to Monica. \\"Take my car today,\\" she suggested. \\"It's clean, for the most part. Hurry up and don't be late.\\" Giving in to the inevitable, Monica accepted the keys and handed Sarah her rag, offering a soft appreciative smile. \\"Thanks, Sarah.\\" As Monica drove off to work in Sarah's car, she couldn't help but think about what Sarah had said regarding the birds and their droppings. Maybe there was something to their natural unpredictability that spoke to the deeper, unexplainable mysteries of life. For a moment, she allowed herself to consider that the droppings were somewhat beautiful, even in their chaos. From that day on, Monica still hated cleaning the bird droppings from her car, but perhaps not quite as much as before. There was a begrudging respect for the chaotic nature of the birds and their droppings, and an odd sense of gratitude for friends like Sarah who could find beauty even in the messiest of situations. And with every cleaned stain, Monica found herself growing more and more appreciative of her feathered foes and secretly hoping that their peculiar form of luck would indeed bring her good fortune."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. On October 16, 2015, Usher released an interactive music video exclusively on the music streaming platform Tidal called \\"Chains\\" that featuring artist Nas and Bibi Bourelly. \\"Chains\\" literally forces the viewer to confront the issue of racial profiling and police brutality head-on: By utilizing the webcam on the viewer's computer as well as facial recognition technology, \\"Chains\\" paused mid-song whenever the viewer's eyes deviate from the video. Usher performed the song for the first time at the Tidal X:1020 concert on October 20, 2015, at Brooklyn's Barclays Arena. On January 14, 2016, after continual delays of his eighth album, Usher announced via Daniel Arsham Instagram post that he changed the title of the album from UR to Flawed. It was scheduled to be released in April 2016, but has been pushed back with no release date. On June 9, 2016, Usher released a new single from his expected forthcoming album Flawed on the music streaming platform Tidal titled \\"No Limit\\" featuring Young Thug, along with a second single titled \\"Crash\\" on June 10 for all digital platforms. On June 12, 2016, it was reported that Raymond signed a management deal with business partner Scooter Braun. Braun already represented Justin Bieber and had a joint venture with Raymond and Bieber. This report was confirmed by Usher during a sit down interview with Ryan Seacrest at the 73rd annual Cannes Festival on June 21, 2016. Usher furthered his acting career, starring as American former professional boxer Sugar Ray Leonard in the 2016 American-Panamanian biographical sports film Hands of Stone about the career of Panamanian former professional boxer Roberto Duran. In it, he starred opposite of Edgar Ramirez, Robert De Niro and Ruben Blades. On August 26, 2016, Hands of Stone premiered worldwide. \\"Missin U\\" was also released as a third single by RCA Records for online streaming and digital download, along with \\"Champions (from the Motion Picture Hands of Stone)\\", both on Vevo. On August 30, \\"Rivals\\" featuring Future was released and debuted exclusively on Tidal with its accompanying video. It was released on Vevo on September 2, 2016. On September 13, 2016, both \\"Missin U\\" and \\"Rivals\\" were sent to radio as the album's third and fourth singles. The album Hard II Love was released on September 16, 2016, and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. It debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, and sold 28,000 copies in the United States in its first week. It also became his seventh consecutive top ten album in the United States. The lead single, \\"No Limit\\" featuring rapper Young Thug initially was serviced to Urban radio on June 9, and eventually peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

Having already destroyed the economics of the cosy international airline world, previously dominated by the European airlines, now the gulf carriers seem set to mess up the airline alliances too. All the major European airlines are now part of one of the three big alliances. There is Star (the biggest) based around Lufthansa and United Airlines; Skyteam based around Air France/KLM and Delta; Oneworld based around BA and American Airlines. Read more: How would you save American Airlines? The gulf airlines have until now eschewed the alliances. Firstly because competitively the alliances didn't want them, and secondly because they were growing very nicely, thank you, without them. I predict that","completion":"in the coming years, the gulf carriers will continue to disrupt the airline industry, not just by joining one of the three major alliances, but also by potentially forming new collaborations, perhaps even their own alliance. The catalyst for this change will be their continued growth, fueled by their strong financial backing, advantageous geographical location, and expanding fleet of cutting-edge, fuel-efficient aircraft. The gulf carriers, led by the likes of Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have consistently posed a significant challenge to the dominance of the major European and American carriers. With their state-of-the-art aircraft, they have managed to tap into the increasing demand for long-haul travel, offering more convenient connections, superior in-flight service, and competitive pricing. As the gulf carriers continue to expand their reach, it's only a matter of time before they exert considerable influence over the existing alliances or form their own. In fact, this process already seems to be underway. In recent years, the gulf carriers have established a number of strategic partnerships with other airlines, some of which are part of the major alliances. Qatar Airways, for instance, joined Oneworld in 2013 as the first of its kind from the region, signaling a shift in the alliance's strategy. Additionally, Emirates and Etihad have entered into codeshare agreements with numerous carriers that are members of the existing alliances. This speaks to their ability to pursue beneficial collaborations despite not being alliance members themselves. By utilizing these strategic partnerships, the gulf carriers can effectively bypass many of the restrictions imposed by the existing alliances while capitalizing on the benefits of cooperation. This approach poses a significant threat to the alliances, and consequently, to the major European and American carriers. The question then arises: how can the existing alliances and their members adapt to this changing landscape? One possible solution is to forge stronger partnerships among themselves. For instance, imagine a Lufthansa-British Airways joint venture or expanded cooperation between Skyteam and Oneworld members. Another option is to evolve their alliance models to better accommodate and integrate gulf carriers, recognizing the potential opportunities they bring to the table. Furthermore, incumbent airlines will need to up their game by improving their understanding of customer preferences, increasing personalization in services, and optimizing connections and schedules based on customer needs. This will require a focus on emerging technologies and data analytics to remain competitive in the face of growing challenges posed by the gulf carriers. In conclusion, the dynamics of the airline industry are bound to change as the gulf carriers' growth continues unchecked. The disruption caused by these airlines will undoubtedly have lasting consequences on the existing alliances and their members, prompting them to rethink and adapt their strategies in order to remain relevant and profitable. While it is difficult to predict the specific future developments of this ongoing saga, one thing is clear: the gulf carriers are here to stay, and their influence on the international airline scene is only set to grow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cardiff competed in top flight but could only manage a fourth-place finish in 1990-91, and exited the Cup at the quarter-final stage. The season did involve some highlights however, such as beating league runners-up and Cup champions Llanelli 43-0 at the Arms Park and beating league champions Neath 18-4 away in the last game of the season. 1991-92 was possibly the club's worst-ever season, beset with disagreements between coach Alan Phillips and manager John Scott. Cardiff crashed out of the Cup before the quarter-final stage and lost at home to Maesteg and Newbridge in the league. Their final league finish was ninth, which would have led to their relegation but the WRU decided mid-season to switch to a 12-team Premiership, therefore saving Cardiff and Maesteg from relegation. Both Scott and Phillips resigned following the season. Australian Alex Evans took over at Cardiff as coach for the 1992-93 season, bringing in former Arms Park legend Terry Holmes and famous ex-Pontypool front-row member Charlie Faulkner as assistants, and helped a turnaround in the club's fortunes, winning their first seven matches of the season and 20 of their first 22 to top the league in the new year. This run came to an end on 23 January; they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter's, who were fourth from bottom of Division Four. The Blue and Blacks only lost four league games all season though, but were unlucky to be competing against Llanelli in the league, who won the double and were considered the best club team in the UK after beating Australia 13-9. In 1993-94 they slid back to fourth in the league but won the SWALEC Cup (renamed from Schweppes Cup for sponsorship reasons) by beating Llanelli, who'd won the tournament for the last three years running. The score in the final was 15-8, with tries from Mike Rayer and club captain centre Mike Hall and kicks from fly-half Adrian Davies. In 1994-95 Cardiff won the final league title of the amateur era in Wales, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Cup before going down 16-9 to Swansea.

Although they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter's, Cardiff only lost four league games throughout the season.

Choices: - san francisco - refrigerator - gay bar - container - plate The rationale to choose \\"refrigerator\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The most appropriate answer to the question is \\"refrigerator.\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"refrigerator\\" is that it is designed to preserve food items, like fruits, and maintain their freshness by providing a cool and controlled environment. In the context of the question, the fruit needs to stay fresh despite the heat, and refrigerators are specifically designed for that purpose. The other options provided are not logical choices for preserving the freshness of fruit in hot conditions: - San Francisco: This is a city and cannot be associated with the preservation and maintenance of fruit freshness in the face of heat. - Gay bar: This is a type of establishment where people go for drinks and entertainment. It does not have a direct correlation with preserving the freshness of fruits in the heat. - Container: A container can be used to store fruit, but it doesn't inherently preserve the freshness of the fruit from the heat. A container can be helpful in keeping the fruit clean and organized, but it will not actively cool or maintain the fruit's freshness in hot conditions. - Plate: A plate is a flat dish on which food is served, but it offers no protection from heat or mechanism for keeping fruits fresh. The plate is not an effective option for maintaining the freshness of fruits in hot temperatures. Therefore, the best answer in this context is \\"refrigerator\\" since it provides a cool environment that preserves fruit freshness and counters the effects of heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\"). According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, \\"weren't even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind.\\" To MTV, he described them as \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on.

Then it went global and everyone thought they had the record, which was so frustrating.\\" A:","completion":"The band in question is Audioslave, and the frontman who left the band is Chris Cornell. Audioslave was formed by former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden in 2001. Chris Cornell was the lead singer of Soundgarden, and he joined forces with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine to create Audioslave. Despite having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest on March 19, 2002. However, just a few days later, reports emerged that the band had disbanded before even performing in front of a public audience. Chris Cornell's manager confirmed his departure from the band, with no explanation provided. Initial rumors suggested that Cornell's departure was due to conflicts between the two management companies involved in the project. Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, while Peter Mensch of Q Prime managed Rage Against the Machine. However, according to the band members themselves, the split was not due to personal conflicts but rather disagreements between their managers. Approximately six weeks after the band's initial breakup, they reformed, fired their former management companies, and hired a new company, The Firm. In order to resolve the issues between their previous record labels, Epic and Interscope, it was agreed that they would alternate in releasing Audioslave's albums.

Tom Morello referred to these leaked tracks as \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress,\\" expressing frustration over the mistaken assumption that they were the finished product.

Question: Who is shy and insecure? Movie plot title: The Witches of Eastwick Movie plot: Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three dissatisfied women living in the picturesque town of Eastwick, Rhode Island. Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees.

Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie's end. As Scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. \\"The Horror,\\" indeed! However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious.

Secondly, the customer specifically criticizes the author, Kathleen Lawless, for her writing style. According to the reviewer, the book mostly contains sex scenes and lacks both plot and romance, which is essential for a satisfying reading experience. It seems that the customer expected a balance between romance and explicit content, but that balance was not found in the work of Kathleen Lawless. Lastly, the reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction by labeling the author as a \\"porn scene writer\\" and advises other potential readers to avoid buying her books if they seek a genuine romance story. This warning to others is a clear sign that the customer was not only dissatisfied but also felt strongly enough to actively discourage other people from making a similar purchasing decision. In conclusion, the customer's review clearly indicates that they were dissatisfied with the product they purchased. Their expressions of disapproval towards the author's writing style, lack of plot and romance, and the advice to stay away from the author's works serve as strong evidence of their disappointment and dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - esoteric - categorized - arcane - cerebral - exclusive The rationale to choose \\"arcane\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"arcane.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"arcane\\" as the answer lies in understanding the meaning of the word \\"esoteric\\" and its relationship to the other options provided. Esoteric information refers to knowledge that is intended for a select few and not easily accessible or understood by the general public. It is often associated with specialized or secret knowledge. Arcane has a similar meaning, as it refers to knowledge that is mysterious or understood by only a few. The other options don't fit the context of the question as well: - Categorized simply means organized into categories, which doesn't relate to the idea of information being exclusive or limited to a select group. - Cerebral pertains to intellectual or mental activity, which doesn't directly relate to the exclusivity of knowledge. - Exclusive, while it could be related to restricting access to information, does not have the same connotation as esoteric or arcane when describing knowledge.

It's a tightly knit community where everyone relies on each other and the caribou for survival. However, strange occurrences and unexplained disappearances of the caribou begin to stir up suspicion and concern among the townspeople. The town's local wildlife conservationist, Dr. Harlow Taylor, discovers an alarming decline in the caribou population. Desperate to save the town and its people from economic collapse, she teams up with Jack, an experienced local tracker, to uncover the reason behind the mysterious caribou disappearances. As they venture deep into the forest, evidence mounts that the caribou are being killed by a pack of unusually aggressive and intelligent wolves. Jack's work requires him to get up close and personal with the wolves, using his tracking skills to study their behavior. With the town's survival at stake, Dr. Taylor and Jack must quell the rising panic among the townspeople, who now perceive the wolves as a genuine threat that needs to be exterminated. Courageous young activist, Sasha, daughter of Dr. Taylor, helps to educate the community about the importance of maintaining a delicate balance between man and nature. Amid animosity and fear, Dr. Taylor discovers a shocking truth – a rogue group of poachers led by a merciless and cunning mastermind, Randall, have been driving the wolves to attack caribou herds. These illegal hunters aim to manipulate the townspeople into killing the wolves, leaving the caribou vulnerable and easy prey, ultimately seizing control of the valuable hunting grounds. In a thrilling and emotional climax, Dr. Taylor, Jack, Sasha, and the locals join forces to expose and confront the poacher gang. Using their knowledge of the wilderness and their strong bond with each other, they outsmart Randall and bring him and his cohorts to justice, thus restoring peace and balance to Ember Valley. As the story reaches its conclusion, the audience is left with a profound message about the need to protect the delicate balance between humans, predators, and prey in the interconnected ecosystem they coexist in.

Late Night with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show hosted by Conan O'Brien that aired 2,725 episodes on NBC between 1993 and 2009. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. Late Night aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. The show's house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg, who also served as a sounding board for O'Brien on the show (more so after Andy Richter's departure). The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie \\"LaBamba\\" Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. James Wormworth served as backup drummer when Weinberg went on tour with Bruce Springsteen. With the departure of Andy Richter, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O'Brien's jokes. One common running gag was Max's awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max's lack of knowledge of current affairs. \\"LaBamba\\" was also used as the butt of many of Conan's jokes. These humorous sketches usually revolved around LaBamba's sizeable mustache, his poor acting skills, and his alleged inability to read written music. Mark Pender would often sing songs on the topic of a current event which ended with him screeching uncontrollably and climbing the risers into the audience. All members of the 7 had successful side careers as studio musicians. As is common in the talk show format, the Max Weinberg 7 performed the show's opening and closing themes, played bumpers into and out of commercial breaks (they actually played through the entire break for the studio audience), and a short piece during O'Brien's crossover to his desk after his monologue (except for several months beginning in April 2008, where a commercial break was inserted at that point). The show's opening theme was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie (a finalist for the job as band leader). The show's closing theme was called \\"Cornell Knowledge\\", and was lifted from Jerry and Jimmy Vivino's first album together. However, on Late Night, it was played at a much quicker tempo than the album version. The band played a wide variety of songs as bumpers--usually popular music from a variety of eras. Weinberg sometimes took extended leaves of absence to tour with Bruce Springsteen as the drummer for his E Street Band. During his absence, temporary replacement drummers were hired (most commonly James Wormworth), and the band was led by Jimmy Vivino (\\"Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7\\"). Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Is there anything else interesting you can share from the article?","completion":"Yes, there is an interesting aspect mentioned in the article regarding the show's house band, The Max Weinberg 7.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \\"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\\" and that they would accelerate \\"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" Question: We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph 4.

Laura being a commando.;","completion":"(A). Amy being a commando. From a very young age, Amy always had the mindset and desire of a true commando. Growing up in a military family, she was inspired by the stories of bravery and camaraderie her father, a decorated Marine, would recite to her every night. Amy's commando training began in her early teenage years, which eventually helped her to become a highly efficient and skilled member of an elite Special Forces unit. Laura, on the other hand, was never interested in that sort of thing. She grew up in the quiet suburbs with a loving family that remained far removed from any military adventures. Her life was filled with the simplicity of an average civilian: finishing school, finding a good job, and settling down with the perfect partner. While Laura had her fair share of bold moments and physical skills, she lacked the training, experience, and tactical knowledge that Amy possessed. As a result, it became apparent that when it came to being stealthy, Amy was far better than Laura. Amy's commando training allowed her to move with the grace and agility of a panther, slipping through the shadows unseen. Her advanced night-time navigation skills meant that her targets would often be unaware of her presence until it was far too late. She could traverse the most difficult terrain with ease, scaling walls, and navigating through narrow tunnels – all while remaining quiet as a whisper. Laura, despite her tenacious spirit and determination, just couldn't compare. Her movements were often clumsy and loud, making her presence known to anyone nearby. Even when she tried her best to be stealthy, her lack of experience and understanding of her surroundings made it difficult for her to move without attracting attention. Over time, Laura began to understand and respect the differences between her and Amy, realizing that each had their own strengths and weaknesses. While she could never match Amy's stealth abilities, Laura thrived in other areas – her natural charisma and social adaptability made her adept at reading people and blending in with various environments, turning her into an excellent undercover agent. Though Amy and Laura each had their own specialties, they soon discovered that they complemented each other well, forming a highly effective team in their covert operations. Amy would handle the tasks that required the utmost stealth and precision, while Laura worked her magic in the realm of information-gathering and infiltration. Together, they became an unstoppable force that consistently triumphed over the most fearsome challenges. As their partnership progressed, Amy and Laura forged a deep bond, learning from one another and realizing that teamwork, mutual respect, and understanding were the keys to success in their dangerous line of work. And while Amy may have been the better commando when it came to stealth, both women embodied courage, dedication, and unwavering loyalty – traits that played a crucial role in securing their victories and ensuring the safety of their comrades and nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - Turkmenidae is an extinct family of lamprids from the Paleogene of Turkmenistan. They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Oligocene is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present (to ). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"oligos\\", few) and (\\"kainos\\", new), and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs. The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period. The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene. Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands, and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt. - Analectis pala is an extinct lamprid of the Family Turkmenidae . Its fossils are found from Late Oligocene strata from what is now Turkmenistan . Analectis , as with the other members of Turkmenidae , was a close relative of the opahs . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Turkmenistan (or ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Opahs (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish (not to be confused with Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: \\"Lampris\\" (from the Greek \\"lamprid-\\", \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus \\"Lampris\\" and the other in the monotypic \\"Megalampris\\", are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.

Steve has just lost his wife to cancer and everything they had is gone due to the treatment. He now lives in the shelter for the homeless. So we know each other. Just like other homeless people, he didn't think he needed anything. But once he mentioned to me he needed eye glasses. His voice hesitated a bit, he looked down, and it appeared like he thought such a request was just a dream. Too much to hope for? It was as if his wish were known by me only. I submitted an application for him to a program that is supposed to provide a free eye examination and glasses. Three months later, I phoned to ask what was up with the appointment but they told me there was a cash flow problem until late summer. Steve showed disappointment, thanked me and started to walk away. I said, \\"Hold on, I will figure out a way to get you an eye examination and glasses.\\" His face lit up a tiny bit. He had seen some of the things I have done for other people in our shelter and to me it looked like he might have a line of hope. I took a picture of him and posted his picture and his story in the Twitter. In about 4 days, eight people from around the world donated 25 each and one person donated 40 and I made up the rest to get him an eye exam and glasses. Steve picked up his glasses on Wednesday: May 11th, 2011. Today Steve has returned to a previous job he had in a nearby car wash. Because he now has glasses he will be able to see what he is doing while cleaning the vehicles. He is starting a second job at a pet center next week!

During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly?

Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change). Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

How many different ways can it be chosen if it must include 2 of each gender? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, the two questions you asked are not paraphrases of each other; in fact, they're related to entirely different subjects. The first question focuses on a concept in statistical modeling and prediction, while the second question is a combinatorics problem in discrete mathematics. Let's dig a bit deeper into each question: 1. \\"Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?\\" Predictors, also known as independent variables, are the variables in statistical models that the model uses to make predictions on the outcome or dependent variable. Including fewer predictors over many might be preferable due to a number of reasons: - Overfitting: With more predictors, a model can become excessively complex, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the training data. Such an overfitted model will perform poorly when faced with new, unseen data because it is too tailored to the training data. - Collinearity: When you include more predictors in a model, the chances of having high correlation or collinearity between some predictors increases. Collinearity can inflate the variance of the model parameters and make the model's estimates and interpretations unreliable. - Parsimony: The principle of parsimony (also known as Occam's Razor) suggests that the simplest model that fits the data is usually the best. Adding unnecessary predictors complicates the model without adding value. - Interpretability: Models with fewer predictors are usually easier to understand and interpret. They carry clear-cut insights about the relationship between predictors and the outcome variable. - Cost and Efficiency: Collecting data for numerous predictors can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, more predictors require more computational resources. 2. \\"A committee of 4 is chosen from 7 men and 6 women. How many different ways can it be chosen if it must include 2 of each gender?\\" To answer this, we use a concept in combinatorics known as combinations. The number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items (denoted as \\"n choose r\\") is given by nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where \\"!\\" represents factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. In this case, we want to choose 2 men out of 7 and 2 women out of 6. The number of ways to do this would be (7 choose 2) * (6 choose 2). So, calculate (7 choose 2) which is 7! / [2!(7-2)!] = 21 ways to choose 2 men out of 7. And calculate (6 choose 2) which is 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15 ways to choose 2 women out of 6. Therefore, there are 21 * 15 = 315 different committees possible with 2 men and 2 women. The first question deals with a common dilemma in statistical modeling—balancing model complexity with prediction accuracy—and the second is a straightforward problem in combinatorics, concerning the number of ways to choose a sub-group from a larger group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- Top American officials harshly criticized Russia on Friday for its continued support of pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner. President Barack Obama said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has the \\"most control\\" over the situation in eastern Ukraine as intelligence indicates that rebels most likely shot down Flight 17 from an area they control with a surface-to-air missile.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: footprints, similar to those of modern humans, were found in Laetoli, Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago. They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright. There were a number of Australopithecus species, which are often referred to as australopiths. Australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago. More is known about another early species, Australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. This species demonstrates a trend in human evolution: the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size. afarensis (Figure 29.42) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern humans. Its brain size was 380–450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain. It also had prognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans. In the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult female A. afarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago (Figure 29.43). The fossil, which is informally called “Lucy,” is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton recovered.

I was barely 10 years old when my dad gave me the responsibility of feeding the chickens and cleaning up the stable. He believed it was important for me to have those jobs to learn responsibility. Then, when I was 22, I found a job in Natchbill at a country music club called the Natchbill Palace, I washed dishes and cooked from 4: 00 pm to 9: 00 pm and then went on stage and sang until 2:00 in the morning. It wasn't long before I became known as a singing cook. I had been rejected so many times by record companies that it was hard not to be discouraged. One night, a woman executive from a company named Warner Brothers Records came to hear me sing. When the show was over, we sat down and talked and after she left, I said to myself it was one more rejection. A few weeks later, my manager received a phone call -- Warner Brothers wanted to sign me to a record deal. Soon after, I released my first record in June 1986. It sold over 2 million copies. My best efforts had gone into every job I've ever held. It was the sense of responsibility that made me feel like a man. Knowing that I had done my best filled me with pride.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse.

The CDU/CSU, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, which are two sister parties in Germany, have voiced their opposition to the directive proposal concerning artificial optical radiation. The primary reason for this opposition is not that they are against taking appropriate measures to address artificial optical radiation, as they understand the importance of implementing strategies to protect the public health and the environment from potential adverse effects caused by artificial optical radiation. Instead, the CDU/CSU have taken this stance to encourage the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union responsible for proposing legislation, to present a more credible and justifiable proposal that aligns with the constitution of the European Union and the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009, is an international agreement that revises and strengthens the governance of the European Union, increasing its transparency, efficiency, and democracy. By rejecting the current directive proposal, the CDU/CSU hope to encourage the Commission to review the legislation and present a new, more effective proposal that addresses the concerns surrounding artificial optical radiation. They expect the new proposal to consider the constitutional framework of the European Union and fulfill the goals set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, hence promoting a more balanced, integrated, and democratic approach to tackling this issue. The CDU/CSU's intention is not to block the efforts to address artificial optical radiation, but rather to ensure that the European Union adopts a well-rounded and constitutionally appropriate legislative framework to deal with this issue. They believe that by pushing for a more credible proposal, the European Union can come up with an effective and sustainable solution that addresses the potential risks and consequences of artificial optical radiation in a manner compatible with the principles of the European constitution and the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat increases blood flow to the injured area and aggravates inflammation. Warm compresses, saunas, and steam showers may do more harm than good in the first three days after your injury occurs. Stay away from heat during this time and stick to cold compresses to help relieve pain and swelling. Do not drink any alcohol while you are recovering. Alcoholic drinks open up the blood vessels in the body. When your blood vessels open up, the swelling in your ankle can become much worse. Alcohol will also delay the healing process, so it is a good idea to avoid it while you recover. Stay away from running and other physical activities to make sure that your ankle heals. Running and other high impact physical activities will only make things worse. Rest for at least one week before resuming exercise. Do not massage your ankle for at least a week. While massaging the pain away in your ankle might sound like a good idea, giving your ankle a massage will just add external pressure to your injury.

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. After the end of this story, Roland: A. joined the Catholic religion B. felt unwilling and hesitant C. not enough information D. has left the camp The answer to this question is:","completion":"B. felt unwilling and hesitant"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: One-Eyed Jacks Movie plot: Rio (Marlon Brando) (also called \\"The Kid\\"), his mentor Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico. The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard. Longworth's awkward self-serving story is easily seen through. All along Rio planned not only to kill Dad, but to pull off a bank robbery in Monterey with his new partners Chico and \\"scum-suckin' pig\\" Bob Emory (Ben Johnson) (who used his knowledge of Dad's whereabouts to force their partnership).

The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.

Although state licensing requirements vary, the minimum standard requirements include the passing of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination, 150 semester units of college education, and one year of accounting related experience. Continuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or have requested to be converted to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation \\"CPA Inactive\\" or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide to the public attestation (including auditing) opinions on financial statements.

Q:The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Polish President Andrzej Duda and a German diplomat joined Mr Urban's family, friends and neighbours in Banie, near the border with Germany. Mr Urban was shot by the attacker, who hijacked his lorry to kill 11 others and injure 48 at a Christmas market. An autopsy report is not expected until early next month. The assailant, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker who had pledged allegiance to so-called Islamic State, was shot dead by police in Italy days after fleeing Germany.

He says that \\"decomposition increases amount of organic matter in soil\\" and \\"bacteria initiate decomposition of plants\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? OPTIONS: (1). coal; (2). fossil fuels; (3). Pesticides; (4). mussels; (5). bacteria; (6). nutrients; (7). burning; (8). shrub beds; Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What would increase the amount of organic matter in soil?\\" is: Answer: (5). bacteria Decomposition is the process of breaking down organic materials such as dead plants and animals, turning them into simpler compounds and nutrients – such as carbon and nitrogen – that are vital for the growth of other organisms. The decomposition process increases the amount of organic matter in the soil, which in turn improves soil structure, nutrient availability, and water retention. Bacteria are critical in initiating and driving the decomposition process. They break down plant materials by secreting enzymes that break complex organic compounds into simpler compounds, which can be absorbed by other organisms, including plants. This means that an increase in the number of bacteria in the soil would lead to faster decomposition rates and an increase in organic matter. The other options given in the quiz do not directly contribute to the increase of organic matter in the soil as related to the given hints. For example: (1). coal and (2). fossil fuels are formed from ancient dead plant and animal matter that has been subjected to high pressure and temperature over millions of years, and their direct application would not lead to an increase of organic matter in the soil. (3). Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests, and they usually have no direct effect on the amount of organic matter in the soil. (4). mussels are aquatic animals, and their presence would not directly affect the soil organic matter content unless they die and decompose on the soil surface. (6). nutrients, while essential for plant growth, do not directly increase organic matter in the soil. Instead, they can indirectly promote organic matter accumulation as plants grow larger and produce more plant residues. (7). burning usually reduces the amount of organic matter in the soil as it oxidizes the organic material, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. (8). shrub beds are composed of plants, and while they can contribute to the organic matter when they die and decompose, they themselves do not directly increase the organic matter content in the soil. Thus, based on the provided hints and context, the best answer to the question is (5). bacteria, as they play a key role in initiating and sustaining the decomposition process that increases the amount of organic matter in soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: John was studying the characteristics of tropical forests. For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways. Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. The answer is:","completion":"Given the hint provided in the question and the information about tropical forests, we can deduce the answer to the question \\"Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland?\\" as follows: Step 1: Identify the characteristics of each forest type. - Laos forests: tropical forests (rainforests) - Ireland forests: temperate zone forests Step 2: Recall the hint, which states that tropical forests receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth due to elevated temperatures, insolation, and rainfall.

Q: Studies suggest that circulating type I interferon (IFN) may predict response to biological agents in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prediction of response prior to initiating therapy would represent a major advancement.', 'We studied sera from a test set of 32 patients with RA from the Auto-immune Biomarkers Collaborative Network Consortium and a validation set of 92 patients with RA from the Treatment Efficacy and Toxicity in Rheumatoid Arthritis Database and Repository registry. The test set included those with good response or no response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors at 14u2005weeks by European League Against Rheumatism criteria. The validation set included subjects with good, moderate or no response at 12u2005weeks. Total serum type I IFN activity, IFN-α and IFN-β activity were measured using a functional reporter cell assay.', 'In the test set, an increased ratio of IFN-β to IFN-α (IFN-β/α activity ratio) in pretreatment serum associated with lack of response to TNF inhibition (p=0.013). Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titre and class of TNF inhibitor did not influence this relationship. A receiver-operator curve supported a ratio of 1.3 as the optimal cut-off. In the validation set, subjects with an IFN-β/α activity ratio >1.3 were significantly more likely to have non-response than good response (OR=6.67, p=0.018).

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which intricate emotions did Turner come up with?\\" is in \\"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided passage, Turner identified four primary emotions rooted in human neurology, which are: 1. Assertive-anger 2. Aversion-fear 3. Satisfaction-happiness 4. Disappointment-sadness. Furthermore, he proposed that these primary emotions combine to form more elaborate and complex emotional experiences known as first-order elaborations.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, sweetie, these two questions are not the same. Let me explain. The first question is about how you can stop seeing a specific person's posts and pictures on Facebook. It's like when you don't want to see your friend's drawings all the time, you can choose to not look at them. For this, on Facebook, you can unfollow that person, which means you won't see their new posts, or you could even block them, which means you won't see them at all, anywhere on Facebook. It's like hiding their drawings from your view. The second question is about the \\"People You May Know\\" feature on Facebook. Sometimes you see people there that you don't really know and you wonder why. This feature works like when you go to a playground and see kids playing there. Some you know because they are from your school, some you might have seen at a grocery store with their parents – these are like Facebook's suggestions. But if you stop going to that playground or that grocery store, you wouldn't see those kids anymore. So on Facebook, if you don't want to see certain people in \\"People You May Know,\\" there isn't a sure way but you can reduce your activity or connections related to them.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of this perception: 1. Negative sentiment: The word \\"manipulative\\" is the primary source of the negative sentiment in the sentence. Manipulative individuals are often seen as dishonest, cunning, or insincere, using their skills and charm to control, deceive, or exploit others for their personal gain. Such behavior is typically frowned upon in society as it goes against values such as trust, integrity, and fairness. 2. Honesty or self-awareness: The term \\"admittedly\\" serves to acknowledge the negative nature of being manipulative. This suggests that the speaker is aware of their manipulative behavior and is, at the very least, transparent about it. Although this may not redeem their actions or intentions, it can be seen as a sign of self-awareness or honesty. People might appreciate this level of openness, as it can at least give them an opportunity to anticipate or respond to such manipulative behavior accordingly. 3. Complex emotions: The combination of the negative term \\"manipulative\\" and the self-aware \\"admittedly\\" may evoke mixed emotions in the listener or reader. They might feel both repulsed by the manipulative behavior and somewhat impressed or surprised by the speaker's candidness about it. This duality may lead to feelings of confusion, caution, or curiosity towards the speaker and their objectives. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"admittedly manipulative\\" would generally be perceived as negative due to the manipulative behavior being confessed, yet the acknowledgment of such behavior through the word \\"admittedly\\" brings an element of honesty or self-awareness into play, complicating the perception and evoking mixed emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored.

She is rescued by the young musketeer d'Artagnan and taken away to his abode, where Constance briefly explains her troubles and asks for d'Artagnan's help.

Background: Percy Robert Miller was born and raised in New Orleans in the Calliope Projects. He is the oldest out of five children. He has one sister, Germaine, and three brothers: Kevin, and platinum-selling rap artists Corey \\"C-Murder\\" & Vyshonne \\"Silkk The Shocker\\" Miller. He attended Booker T. Washington High School & Warren Easton High School. Context: On Master P's track \\"Brick to a Million\\", with Fat Trel and Alley Boy, Master P rapped lyrics that many interpreted as a diss to Kanye West and Lil Wayne. On the song, he raps, \\"New hittas wearing dresses, f it, I ain't scared to address it, Gangstas on skateboards, I'm at the house breaking headboards, Real stand up.\\" During an interview with Power 106's Big Boy's Neighborhood, Master P cleared up misconceptions about the lyrics, stating that he was not addressing those rappers in particular but was instead talking about a radio station employee who told him he was finished. \\"Even that, that ain't a diss. I never made a diss record. Like I said, a lot of people, if you feel salty behind that, then I could say if the shoe fit well, I'm not afraid to address it,\\" he said. \\"I just feel like in Hip Hop, we've got to stick to whether we're going to be real or we not. Like I said, I'm just addressing what I see. To be honest with you, that particular song wasn't about nobody in Hip Hop but I think people taking it like that. This was one of these guys that worked at the radio station and didn't believe in me and told me it was over for me. He ridin' up on a skateboard and got a little mini-skirt on. This a new dude into the business, and he telling me it's over for me.\\" Master P, who was rumored to have issues with Cash Money Records back in the day, said that if the rappers took offense to the song, they might want to rethink their choices. But he insists that he has no beef with either of them. \\"If you feel guilty about something, then that's something you need to address about with yourself,\\" he said. \\"Y'all gotta realize, we really from the streets. If there really was a feud, there would have been a problem. But I got love for Baby and them, Lil Wayne. They come from where I come from. It's always been a competition. Everybody want to be the best.\\" Question: so is was just a track on an album?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, \\"Brick to a Million\\" is just a track on an album. Master P's lyrics in the song were not specifically targeted at Kanye West or Lil Wayne but were addressing a radio station employee who told him his career was finished. While some people interpreted the lyrics as a diss to certain rappers, Master P clarified in an interview that he has no beef with them and it was not intended as a diss track."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Gov. Rodrigo Medina said all the suspects confessed to participating in the casino attack, as planners, perpetrators, lookouts or drivers. In the immediate aftermath of the firebombing last week, President Felipe Calderon branded the attackers “true terrorists” and suggested that the country was entering a new stage in the drug war. Calderon also blamed the United States — its drug users, its gun dealers and its government — for the tragedy, saying that the billions in illegal profits from drug sales fund the criminals in Mexico. Also Monday, authorities released video footage from a security camera that showed some of the alleged assailants filling three cans at a gas station a few minutes before the attack. Other video footage is more difficult to explain. One tape shows a group of Monterrey municipal police cars parked 200 yards from the casino as it is being torched. The police appear not to have responded. Images taken by residents using cellphones also show local police in the area before and during the attack. As for the motive, Medina said the Zetas were extorting money from the casino. In Mexico, thousands of businesses must pay “tolls” and “rents” to criminals — or face the consequences. Critics say the government is partly responsible for the tragedy, as the casino business has boomed under Calderon and many establishments operate without regulation or supervision. The operations are mostly cash businesses, ideal for money laundering. The Reforma newspaper reported Monday that 100 of the 800 casinos in operation are probably illegal. Investigators are also interested in whether the Casino Royale had operating emergency exits and water sprinklers. Video footage released earlier showed four vehicles with about a dozen men pulling up to the front of the casino Thursday afternoon; as some stand guard by their trucks and cars out front, others draw weapons and rush into the casino with the gasoline. Less than three minutes later, black smoke and red flames are seen pouring out of the entertainment complex. Monterrey residents marched on government offices Sunday and demanded Medina’s resignation. More than 1,500 federal police officers were sent to the city in a show of force. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

The brother of murdered British aid worker Alan Henning has called on David Cameron to send troops to hunt down the Islamic State (IS) militants responsible for his death. Reg Henning said the brutal Islamist group were 'monsters' and ground forces were needed to find them. In a BBC interview, he said that the Henning family had been in a 'living nightmare' and condemned the Government for preventing them from speaking out about his brother's capture. Alan Henning poses for a friend as they wait to cross the Turkish border. Not long after the photo was taken, he was kidnapped by IS terrorists. He believed that he would be freed but last week the Islamic State posted a video of his beheading. We've had to keep it quiet for nine months, we've been gagged by the Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) not to say a thing. Reg Henning said that the imposed silence was extremely difficult for the family, as they had to endure their loved one's captivity without the support of the public or being able to raise awareness about his situation. The family understood that the Government wanted to handle the situation carefully and not escalate matters, but they felt that more could have been done to secure Alan's release. Reg Henning believes that sending ground troops to fight against the Islamic State is crucial because airstrikes alone will not be enough to eradicate the threat. With soldiers on the ground, they would have a greater chance of locating and capturing those responsible for his brother's death and preventing further tragedies involving innocent civilians. The Government had been hesitant to send ground troops to the area due to the complexity of the situation and the risks involved. However, the growing threat of IS and the wave of public outrage following the beheading of multiple hostages, including British citizens, might pressure the Government to seriously consider this option. In response to the interview, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, released a statement expressing his deep condolences to the Henning family and reiterating the Government's commitment to defeating the Islamic State. He said that the UK would continue to work with its international partners to strengthen a coalition against the extremist group and explore all possible solutions to bring about peace and stability in the region. Cameron also stated that even though ground troops might not be deployed immediately, the option was always on the table as a potential future strategy, depending on the evolving circumstances and intelligence. As of now, the public debate on sending ground troops to combat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq continues both in the UK and internationally. One thing is clear, however: the tragic story of Alan Henning has amplified the urgency to find a definitive solution to put an end to the horrifying acts carried out by this extremist group, and ensure that more innocent lives are not lost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, removing spaces can make it more difficult to read and comprehend the sentence, as our brains are accustomed to recognizing words separated by spaces. In this specific sentence, the message conveys information about the location of a church on the island of La Giudecca and its construction dates according to the plans of architect Andrea Palladio. By keeping the original sentence structure, we can better appreciate the historical context and architectural significance of this statement. The church mentioned in the sentence is likely the Church of the Redeemer, or Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore, which is indeed located on the island of La Giudecca in Venice, Italy. This church is a significant example of Renaissance architecture, showcasing the remarkable skills and artistic vision of architect Andrea Palladio, who was one of the most influential figures in Western architecture. Palladio's work, which spans both secular and religious buildings, is known for its harmony, symmetry, and adherence to classical forms. The construction of the Church of the Redeemer began in 1577 and was completed in 1592, nearly 15 years later. The church had a significant role in Venetian history, as it was commissioned by the Venetian Senate as an act of thanksgiving following the end of a devastating plague epidemic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. A stressful home life, medical problems, or personal issues could be making them feel frustrated or sad. Check in periodically with your employees. Ask them thoughtful, open-ended questions about their lives to see what may be causing their negativity. It’s good to ask these questions in a casual setting, such as by the coffee machine or in the lunch room. For example, you might ask, “How is your family doing?” or “How have you been doing recently?” If the employee does not want to talk about their personal life, do not push the issue. Just say, “I understand.” You might talk to them about less personal subjects, such as television, sports, or weather. If you acknowledge your employee's accomplishments, they will have more pride in their work. Let them know that you are proud of their work. This will help reinforce positive behaviors in the workplace. For example, if Marla recently completed a big project, you can say, “Great job on this project! You did really well getting this out to us quickly.” Be specific with your feedback. For example, you might say, \\"You saved us so much money this quarter after finding that error in the books. We really appreciate having you here.\\" In many cases, people may feel as though their work is worthless. To give your employees a sense of purpose, remind them of how important their work is to their coworkers, team, and company. For example, you might say, “Thank you for completing these reports. I know they’re tedious, but they help everyone get the information they need more quickly.” You can also say something like, \\"We would not have been able to complete this project without you.\\" Even if you think the change will be a positive one, asking your employees about their opinions helps them feel as though they have a say in their workplace. Consider implementing their feedback if possible. Open-ended questions are best, as they will help you get more honest feedback. For example, you might say, “We’re thinking of making some changes to the breakroom. What would you like to see there?” For decisions that come from higher up, give your employees plenty of warning if possible. You might say, “Senior management is thinking of extending work hours during the holiday season. What concerns might you have about this?” Never dismiss their problem, even if it comes from a very negative employee. Occasionally, take the chance to repeat what they are saying back to them. This will reinforce that you hear and understand their frustrations. For example, you might say, “What I am hearing is that you are upset that IT ignores your broken computer. Is that correct?” Seriously consider all suggestions. Instead of saying, “no, we can’t do that,” you might say, “Let me think about it and get back to you” or “yes, we might be able to do that.” Ignoring problems does not make them go away, and it can worsen negativity in the office. Your employees will feel better about their work if they think that their concerns are taken seriously.

Answer: Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination . Question: how does the e coli bacteria cause death Answer:","completion":"The Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria can cause death through several mechanisms, including the production of toxins, invasion of tissues, and inducing sepsis. Understanding how these processes work can help in the development of treatments and preventive measures against E. coli infections. 1. Production of toxins: Some strains of E. coli produce potent toxins, such as Shiga toxins, which are responsible for the severe symptoms of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The Shiga toxins are comprised of two main types: Stx1 and Stx2. These toxins target endothelial cells, which are cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels, particularly in the kidneys, intestines, and brain. Once Shiga toxins enter the cells, they inhibit protein synthesis by cleaving a specific adenine base from the 28S rRNA of the 60S ribosomal subunit. This action halts the process of translation leading to cell death (cytotoxicity). The damaged endothelial cells can cause inflammation and blood vessels to become more permeable, resulting in bloody diarrhea and, in severe cases, HUS. HUS is characterized by hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and acute kidney injury, which can progress to kidney failure and be life-threatening. 2. Invasion of tissues: Some strains of E. coli, such as enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), can directly invade host tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. EIEC strains are similar to Shigella species in their ability to invade and multiply within intestinal epithelial cells. They cause the destruction of the host cell cytoskeleton, leading to cell death, which results in inflammation and ulceration of the intestinal mucosa. EPEC strains adhere to the surface of intestinal cells, causing a rearrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton and the formation of pedestal-like structures called \\"attaching and effacing\\" lesions. These lesions damage the microvilli on the surface of intestinal cells, impairing their ability to absorb nutrients and causing watery diarrhea. 3. Inducing sepsis: In rare cases, E. coli can cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by the body's extreme response to an infection. This can occur when the bacteria break through the intestinal barrier and enter the bloodstream, subsequently spreading throughout the body. Sepsis triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction, circulatory collapse, and, ultimately, death. In conclusion, E. coli bacteria can cause death through various mechanisms, including the production of toxins (such as Shiga toxins), invasion of tissues, and inducing sepsis. These processes lead to symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening conditions like HUS and sepsis. Preventing E. coli infections through proper hygiene, safe food handling, and maintaining clean water sources is crucial for reducing the risk of life-threatening complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this proper case.","completion":"He appears to be independent, exuding an aura of coolness and even insensitivity. This demeanor stands for idealism, as the predominant blue shade signifies thought and contemplation. However, a small portion of yellow represents the origin of ideas, inspiration, and the sudden emergence of innovative concepts. The individual's independent nature is not merely an affectation, but rather a deeply ingrained aspect of their character. It may stem from a desire for autonomy or a need for personal growth. The cool and detached demeanor could be a coping mechanism or a method of self-preservation, shielding the individual from the emotional turmoil that can arise from relationships and social interactions. Moreover, this person's inclination towards idealism indicates that they might be a deep thinker, someone who ponders philosophical questions and engages with abstract concepts. They are drawn to the pursuit of intellectual growth and the refinement of ideas. The blue that dominates their aura signifies their commitment to a life of introspection and self-discovery. Yet, it is not solely about introspection and contemplation; the presence of yellow highlights the individual's capacity for creativity and ingenuity. They are not just a passive observer of the world but an active participant in its evolution. The flash of yellow suggests that they possess a fertile imagination, one that is capable of conceiving original ideas and novel perspectives. In this sense, the yellow acts as a counterbalance to the blue, preventing the individual from becoming too immersed in their inner world and instead fueling their desire to contribute to the external world. It is the spark that ignites their creative fire, propelling them to explore new horizons and challenge conventional wisdom. Furthermore, this combination of blue and yellow embodies the potential for synergy between intellect and creativity. When these two seemingly disparate elements are harnessed together, they can create a powerful confluence of thought and inspiration. This enables the individual to not just conceive of groundbreaking ideas but to also bring them to fruition. In essence, the individual's independent nature, cool demeanor, and predilection for idealism are deeply interconnected. These traits combine to forge a unique individual who is unafraid to embark on a personal journey of discovery and self-improvement. As they traverse this path, they remain open to the sudden flashes of inspiration that emerge along the way - the yellow sparks that light up the otherwise thoughtful blue landscape. Together, these qualities form the foundation of a person who is constantly evolving, always striving to refine their thoughts, and contribute their innovative ideas to the world around them."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"What people were deciding what should happen with the book?\\" Context: \\"One of the first incidents of the book being challenged was in Hanover, Virginia, in 1966: a parent protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Federer hadn't beaten Nadal in seven years in a grand slam -- and on a chilly night in Melbourne the world No. 1 kept the streak alive, improving his record over the Swiss to 23-10 overall as he advanced to the Australian Open final. The Spaniard pulled out a tight first set and then cruised to a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 6-3 victory Friday to set up an encounter with Federer's compatriot, Stanislas Wawrinka. \\"I played a lot of times against Roger, and a lot of times I played great against him,\\" Nadal told reporters. \\"So probably that's why I had this success against him.\\" But Nadal's transition from defense to offense thwarted","completion":"Federer once again, as the Swiss maestro struggled to find answers to his relentless, physical style of play. Even with the guidance of his new coach, Ivan Ljubicic, Federer was unable to unlock the secrets of neutralizing Nadal's powerful groundstrokes and aggressive play. Nadal's victory over Federer was the result of a combination of factors, including his relentless pressure, consistent serving, and near-perfect execution of his game plan. The Spaniard's ferocious groundstrokes not only kept Federer off balance but also pushed him further behind the baseline, preventing him from dictating the points and giving Nadal the initiative. Throughout the match, Nadal targeted Federer's weaker backhand side, a tactic that paid off handsomely as it yielded several critical unforced errors from the Swiss legend. Nadal's consistent serving and high break-point conversion rate further compounded Federer's troubles and ultimately led to his downfall. Despite the loss, Federer remained gracious in defeat, praising Nadal for his impressive performance and acknowledging that the better player had won on the day. \\"Rafa played a great match, and I can only congratulate him,\\" Federer said. \\"He was the better player tonight, and he deserves to be in the final. It's disappointing, but I know I gave it my all.\\" As Nadal prepares to face Stanislas Wawrinka in the final, many are wondering if the Swiss no. 2 can overcome the world no. 1. Wawrinka has shown tremendous form throughout the tournament, dispatching the likes of Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route to his first Australian Open final. While Wawrinka's recent success against Nadal, including an impressive victory in the 2014 Australian Open final, gives him confidence heading into the showdown, he is fully aware of the herculean task before him. \\"Rafa is a fighter and a great competitor,\\" Wawrinka said. \\"I know I have to play my best tennis if I want to have a chance against him.\\" Regardless of the outcome of the final, Nadal's victory over Federer has once again reinforced his status as one of the greatest players of all time. With 23 wins in their 33 head-to-head meetings, the Spaniard has firmly established his dominance over the Swiss legend. The Australian Open final between Nadal and Wawrinka promises to be a thrilling encounter, featuring two players at the peak of their powers. Fans are eagerly anticipating a memorable match that could potentially see Nadal claim his 16th grand slam title, further narrowing the gap between him and the all-time leader, Federer.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. Answer:","completion":"Given the hint provided, it is more likely that country B, with a smaller population of the species, would see a higher growth rate compared to country A. In country B, there is plenty of food and other resources available for each individual, leading to a higher birth rate and increased reproduction.

Would \\"Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Peat moss is an excellent medium for growing a variety of plants due to its unique properties, and although the answer provided gives some valuable information, it might not be comprehensive enough for someone looking to understand why peat moss is good for growing. Here's a more detailed answer: Peat moss is harvested from decomposed Sphagnum moss, which is found in peat bogs. It has several characteristics that make it an ideal growing medium for various types of plants: 1. Water retention: Peat moss can absorb about 10 to 20 times its dry weight in water, ensuring plants receive enough moisture, but also with adequate air circulation, as peat moss does not become compact. 2. Aeration: Peat moss is lightweight and fibrous, which helps create air pockets that provide proper aeration for root systems, promoting good root development. 3. Acidity: Peat moss has a slightly acidic pH level (between 3.5 and 6), which is suitable for acid-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, and camellias, but it should be amended with lime when growing plants that prefer a higher pH. 4. Sterile environment: Peat moss is generally free of weed seeds and harmful pathogens, reducing the risk of contamination and offering a clean growing environment. 5. Slow decomposition: Peat moss decomposes slowly, reducing the need to replace it frequently, making it a cost-effective growing medium. Coming back to the original response, it's true that different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, which can lead to a variation of Sphagnum species present in any one peatland. While this information helps explain the biodiversity in peatlands, it does not directly address the benefits of peat moss for growing plants. The answer should ideally focus more on the advantages of using peat moss as a growing medium, as detailed above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Build a satellite - Attach a rocket - Add rocket fuel - Launch rocket - Satellite goes into orbit. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more satellites are built happens, how will it affect fewer rockets are needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the process step by step and examine the potential effects of having more satellites built but fewer rockets needed. Step 1: Build a satellite - Building more satellites may lead to advancements in satellite technology and reduced production costs due to economies of scale. However, this step does not directly affect the number of rockets needed. Step 2: Attach a rocket - The number of rockets needed depends on the number of satellites that need to be launched. If more satellites are built but fewer rockets are needed, this implies that multiple satellites are being launched using a single rocket or that some satellites do not require rocket-based launches. Step 3: Add rocket fuel - If fewer rockets are needed, the demand for rocket fuel would also decrease, potentially driving down costs and reducing the environmental impact of rocket fuel production and consumption. Step 4: Launch rocket - Launching fewer rockets could lead to a reduction in the overall risk of launch failures and reduce the environmental impact associated with rocket launches. Additionally, if more satellites are built and the demand for rocket launches decreases, the launch market may become more competitive, potentially lowering launch costs. Step 5: Satellite goes into orbit - The addition of more satellites into orbit could lead to increased space traffic management challenges, the potential for space debris, and increased competition for specific orbital slots. However, this does not necessarily have a direct impact on the number of rockets required. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that having more satellites but fewer rockets needed may result from innovations in satellite technology, more efficient launch systems, or alternative satellite deployment methods. This may lead to a reduction in launch costs and environmental impact. However, an increased number of satellites in orbit could present challenges related to space traffic management and space debris."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Britain Mourns 300th Death in Afghan War The milestone, gloomily awaited in Britain in recent weeks, was reached with the death on Sunday of a Royal Marine in a hospital in Birmingham. He was flown there after being wounded by a roadside bomb in the southwestern Afghan province of Helmand on June 12. He has not yet been identified. Among the foreign powers involved in the war, Britain has suffered casualties second only to the 1,126 of the United States. But the British losses are higher proportionally when set against the two nations’ populations, overall military manpower and Afghanistan deployments. Britain, with about 60 million people, has nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. The United States, with five times the population and its commitment still building from the 30,000-troop surge ordered by President Obama last year, has about 94,000 troops there. In both countries, the governments have come under political pressure from faltering public support for the war. The statement from Mr. Cameron — who visited British troops in Helmand 10 days ago — reflected the growing sense that his government, in office barely six weeks, is resolved not to allow itself to be dragged into an open-ended military commitment. “Of course, the 300th death is no more or less tragic than the 299 that came before,” Mr. Cameron said. “But it is a moment, I think, for the whole country to reflect on the incredible service and sacrifice and dedication that our armed services give on our behalf.” “We are paying a high price for keeping our country safe, for making our world a safer place, and we should keep asking why we are there and how long we must be there,” he added. “The truth is that we are there because the Afghans are not yet ready to keep their own country safe and to keep terrorists and terrorist training camps out of their country. That’s why we have to be there. “But as soon as they are able to take care of security for their own country, that is when we can leave,” he said. Also on Monday, officials in the Foreign Office confirmed that Britain’s most senior diplomat dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, is leaving his post. Sir Sherard, 55, has been Britain’s counterpart to Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama’s special envoy to the two countries, and has occasionally ruffled feathers in Washington with his outspoken advocacy of a more radical shift from war to talks with the Taliban. The officials who confirmed that he had quit said that he had not been fired, and was seeking appointment to another diplomatic post. The unnamed Royal Marine who died Sunday, from the 40 Commando Royal Marines, was wounded near the embattled town of Sangin. As in his case, nearly two-thirds of all allied military casualties in recent years have been caused by so-called I.E.D.’s, or improvised explosive devices. Senior government officials, including Mr. Cameron, have joined military chiefs in accusing the former Labour government of not giving British troops enough transport helicopters or updated mine-resistant troop carriers to cope with the threat from the roadside bombs. In other ways, the new government in London has signaled an impatience with the war, and a readiness, if progress is not evident by the end of the year, to review its commitment and move toward a graduated troop withdrawal beginning next year. Last week, it announced it was accelerating the retirement of Britain’s top military officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, who, officials in the Cameron government said, was judged to have been too pliant in his dealings with the government of Gordon Brown. Also being hastened into retirement is the Defense Ministry’s chief civil servant, Sir Bill Jeffrey, who, these officials said, was judged to have allowed money-wasting “bloat” in the ministry’s civilian staff, and other management blunders. The mood of the new government has been closely watched by top Pentagon officials who see any potential weakening of British resolve as a setback for their efforts to persuade skeptics in the Obama administration to give the American troop surge time to try to turn the tide of the war. Under Mr. Obama’s plans, a review of progress is set for later this year, before a 2011 deadline for beginning a drawdown of troops. Earlier this month, Gen. David H. Petraeus, who has overall responsibility for the war as chief of the United States Central Command, joined Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in lobbying Mr. Cameron and other top British officials in London, telling them America could not fight the war without Britain, and urging them to defer judgment about the surge’s success. 9 NATO Deaths in Afghanistan KABUL, Afghanistan — Nine NATO service members died Monday in southern and eastern Afghanistan, according to a NATO spokesman.

Title: Face/Off Movie plot: September 1991:In a flashback, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is taking his six year old son Michael for a ride on the Griffith Park carousel in downtown Los Angeles. As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael's face and smiles.Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse's mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son's body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.Six Years Later:Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt.

Help as much as you can. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe. Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. Question: Why do people want to increase organic farming?

Why do bubbles have spherical shape explain with the concept of excess pressure and binding forces ? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"I'll address these questions separately. 1. The Gettysburg Address was delivered by Abraham Lincoln on November 19, 1863, during the American Civil War. It was a speech that emphasized the principles of human equality, liberty, and the importance of preserving the Union. The speech was given at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, following the Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. 2. Bubbles have a spherical shape mainly due to the concept of surface tension and minimizing energy. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Surface tension is the result of cohesive forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid (such as water) that cause the molecules to stick together, creating a kind of \\"skin\\" on the surface. Step 2: When a bubble forms, the film of liquid surrounding it is stretched, and the surface tension causes the film to contract. Step 3: The bubble will naturally take the shape that minimizes its surface area, which in turn minimizes the energy needed to maintain the surface tension. A sphere is the shape with the smallest surface area for a given volume, so bubbles take on a spherical shape to minimize their surface area. Regarding excess pressure, due to the curved surface of the bubble, the pressure inside it is greater than the pressure outside. This difference in pressure, known as the excess pressure, helps keep the bubble from collapsing and balances the contracting force of surface tension. Excess pressure is directly proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the bubble's radius. 3. No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about a historical event and speech given by Abraham Lincoln, while the second question is about the scientific explanation behind the spherical shape of bubbles. They are completely different topics - one is related to history and the other is related to physics and chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We have: 1239 * i + 14866 = 3041 * i - 24778 First, we're going to get all the i's together. So, let's move the 1239 * i from the left side to the right side by subtracting it from both sides. That will give us: 14866 = 3041 * i - 1239 * i - 24778 Now let's find out how many i's we have left on the right side. To do that, subtract 1239 from 3041: 3041 - 1239 = 1802 So now we have: 14866 = 1802 * i - 24778 Next, let's move the -24778 from the right side to the left side by adding it to both sides. That will give us: 14866 + 24778 = 1802 * i Now we'll add those two numbers together: 39644 = 1802 * i Now, to find the value of i, we need to divide both sides by 1802: 39644 ÷ 1802 = i It turns out that: i = 22 So there you have it!

Wait for your yellow flowers to fade and for the leaves to grow. At this point, the plant starts to develop next year's buds, and the plant carries the buds through the fall and winter season.

To provide more context and details about Nigeria's victories in the African Cup of Nations, let's take a closer look at each winning campaign: 1. 1980: Nigeria's first African Cup of Nations win came when they hosted the tournament, making it the 12th edition of the competition. The event took place between March 8th and 22nd, with eight countries competing. Nigeria was in Group A, along with Algeria, Guinea, and Tanzania. They topped the group with four points, advancing to the final stage. In the final, Nigeria faced Algeria in a decisive match, securing a 3-0 victory. The goals were scored by Segun Odegbami (2) and Mudashiru Lawal, making Nigeria the African champions. 2. 1994: The 19th edition of the African Cup of Nations took place in Tunisia from January 26th to February 13th. Nigeria was placed in Group B, along with Gabon, Egypt, and Zambia. The Nigerian team topped the group with six points, proceeding to the knockout stage. In the quarterfinals, they defeated Zaire 2-0 and went on to beat Ivory Coast in the semifinals with a 2-1 score. Nigeria met Zambia in the final, winning 2-1 with goals scored by Emmanuel Amunike and Rashidi Yekini, therefore becoming African champions for the second time. 3. 2013: Nigeria's third victory in the African Cup of Nations took place at the 29th edition of the competition, held in South Africa from January 19th to February 10th. Placed in Group C, along with Zambia, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia, Nigeria finished at the top of the group with five points.

There is more NLP work on English than on Bengali because it has little linguistic resources. OPTIONS: (i). English. (ii). Bengali.","completion":"In the given sentence, the entity being referred to is Bengali. The sentence states that there is more Natural Language Processing (NLP) work on English than on Bengali due to the latter having fewer linguistic resources. To understand this statement, let's break down the sentence and analyze the information it provides. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. There are several languages in the world, and researchers strive to develop NLP models and systems that cater to as many languages as possible. However, their success greatly depends on the availability of linguistic resources for each language. Linguistic resources include elements such as annotated data, dictionaries, grammar rules, and other language-specific tools that help NLP systems gain proficiency in understanding and processing a particular language. These resources are vital for training NLP models and improving their performance. The sentence in question highlights a disparity in the availability of linguistic resources between English and Bengali. English, being one of the most widely spoken languages globally, enjoys abundant linguistic resources due to its extensive use in various sectors such as education, business, science, and technology. As a result, there has been considerably more NLP work on English than on Bengali. On the other hand, Bengali, although a major language, particularly in Bangladesh and some regions in India, does not have as many available linguistic resources. This limitation consequently affects the amount of NLP research and development efforts focusing on the Bengali language. Thus, the entity being referred to in the sentence is Bengali (answer option (ii)), as it is the one that has fewer linguistic resources, leading to less NLP work being done compared to English."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: You can buy fake teeth at many costume shops. Fake teeth are often designed to look as if some of your teeth are missing. You can visit a local costume or craft store and see if they sell fake teeth. Many people think of hillbillies as people with missing teeth. A trucker hat may be a good idea, for either a man or a woman. Trucker hats are sometimes associated with redneck/hillbilly culture. Rednecks are slightly different than hillbillies, however. Rednecks are thought of as working class southerners, while hillbillies tend to live in rural areas not necessarily in the south. A trucker hat may be seen as more redneck than hillbilly. You can try carrying a knapsack, which is a small bag usually made out of a blanket or rag. As hillbillies are often thought of as homeless or wandering, this could help you get the image down. Try carrying something like toilet paper in your knapsack. You can pull it out and carry this at parties or for pictures. Toilet paper may indicate you have to use the bathroom in the woods, giving you the rustic hillbilly feel. Bandanas are often associated with hillbilly outfits. Try tying a bandana around your neck or wrapping your hair in a bandana. You can choose any style you like, but a checkered style may best convey the hillbilly aesthetic. Beer can help you give off a rustic, working class vibe. Consider carrying a beer can around, or something like a forty ounce of beer. Keep in mind beer is slightly more associated with rednecks than hillbillies. As stated, the two are different. A beer can may result in your costume getting mistaken for a redneck costume. Straw hats are often associated with the hillbilly lifestyle. Consider buying a wide-brimmed straw hat and adding it to your hillbilly outfit. Summary:","completion":"This article is about dressing up like a hillbilly. You can find fake teeth at costume shops to look like you have missing teeth. Some people wear trucker hats, but this might make you look more like a redneck than a hillbilly.

Answer: He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba . Question: what president was theodore roosevelt A:","completion":"Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, was a multifaceted individual who made significant contributions to American history in various ways. His presidency, which took place from September 14, 1901, to March 4, 1909, marked a period of progressive reforms and aggressive foreign policy. Before becoming President, Roosevelt held several key positions, including serving as a member of the New York State Assembly, New York City Police Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Governor of New York. One of his most notable achievements before his presidency was the formation of the Rough Riders, which was only a small part of his vast political and military experience. In 1898, when the United States engaged in the Spanish-American War, Theodore Roosevelt promptly resigned from his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He did this in order to form the Rough Riders, a voluntary cavalry regiment that played a crucial role in the war. This group comprised a diverse mix of individuals, including cowboys, ranchers, miners, Native Americans, and Ivy League athletes. The Rough Riders notably fought and gained victory in the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba, which significantly contributed to the United States' triumph in the Spanish-American War. Theodore Roosevelt's leadership and valor in this battle boosted his popularity and national profile, earning him the nickname \\"Teddy, the Hero of San Juan Hill.\\" Roosevelt's Rough Riders experience illustrated his courage, leadership skills, and dedication to the nation. After the war, he became Governor of New York and ultimately Vice President under William McKinley. Following McKinley's assassination, Roosevelt assumed the presidency and built his legacy on his progressive policies, conservation efforts, and assertive foreign policy, which earned him a place among the most well-regarded Presidents in U.S. history. In conclusion, while the statement \\"He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba\\" is an accurate description of a part of Theodore Roosevelt's career, it does not fully answer the question of what president he was. Theodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States, and his experiences with the Rough Riders, alongside his numerous other accomplishments and political roles, contributed to his presidential legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The neurosurgeon, who was a close friend of the late three-time champion Ayrton Senna, served as the sport's medical delegate from 1978 until 2004. Watkins was instrumental in introducing many of the safety improvements in the sport during that period. As trackside doctor, he played a major role in saving the lives of several grand prix drivers after heavy crashes. Among them were Ferrari's Didier Pironi at the 1982 German Grand Prix, Jordan's Rubens Barrichello at Imola in 1994 and McLaren's Mika Hakkinen at Adelaide in 1995. \\"It was Sid Watkins that saved my life in Imola 94,\\" said Barrichello on Twitter. \\"Great guy to be with, always happy. Thanks for everything you have done for us drivers. RIP.\\" Watkins's replacement as F1 medical delegate, Gary Hartstein, told BBC Sport: \\"Sid was absolutely the most charismatic and extraordinary problem-solver I've ever met. \\"What he got done was extraordinary - but it was the way he got it done in the face of extraordinary opposition at the time. He kept pushing and pushing so hard to the extent that it is now accepted as 'the way'.\\" Watkins worked in F1 alongside his full-time job at Whitechapel Hospital in London. He was appointed chairman of the FIA Expert Advisory Safety Committee, which was set up in 1994 following the deaths of Austrian Roland Ratzenberger and Senna on successive days after Barrichello's crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing Working closely with then-FIA president Max Mosley and race director Charlie Whiting, Watkins was instrumental in transforming safety in F1 - there have been no driver deaths in the sport since Senna on 1 May 1994. After stepping down as F1's medical delegate in 2004, he continued to have an involvement in F1 safety with governing body the FIA. Last year, he stepped down as president of the FIA Institute, but had continued in an honorary role. FIA president Jean Todt said: \\"This is a truly sad day for the FIA family and the entire motor sport community. Sid was loved and respected in equal measure by all those who knew and worked with him. We will always be grateful for the safety legacy that he has left our sport.\\" Watkins was given a role in F1 in 1978 by Bernie Ecclestone, now the sport's commercial boss and then the head of the now-defunct teams' organisation, the Formula One Constructors' Association (Foca). \\"Bernie choosing Sid to become the Foca surgeon in 1978 was quite fortuitous,\\" said Hartstein. \\"He channelled all the energies of the team bosses of the time and turned it into the structure we now all take for granted. \\"When Max set up the Advisory Safety Committee, that's when it all got completely exploited. After '94 it became very scientific.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device McLaren chairman and former team boss Ron Dennis said: \\"Today the world of motor racing lost one of its true greats. \\"No he wasn't a driver. No he wasn't an engineer. No, he wasn't a designer. He was a doctor and it's probably fair to say that he did more than anyone, over many years, to make Formula 1 as safe as it is today. \\"Many drivers and ex-drivers owe their lives to his careful and expert work, which resulted in the massive advances in safety levels that today's drivers possibly take for granted.\\" Jody Scheckter, the 1979 F1 world champion, added: \\"Most of the time I spent with Sid was in 1979 and 80 when we worked together on all aspects of safety. \\"The thing that stand out for me is the way he went against the politics in racing to achieve a safer environment for the drivers. That takes a lot.\\" Watkins was a well-liked character, with a ready smile, who became close to many drivers - and none more than Senna. He recounted in his autobiography that he had tried to persuade Senna to retire in a conversation at the scene of Ratzenberger's accident. Senna broke down at the crash scene and cried on Watkins' shoulder. Watkins wrote that he said to Senna: \\"What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing.\\" Senna replied: \\"Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit. I have to go on.\\" Twenty-four hours later, Watkins attended to Senna himself after the Brazilian's own fatal crash. Senna's nephew Bruno, who now races for Williams, said on Twitter: \\"RIP Prof. Sid Watkins. Sad news for us who stay behind.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Sid Watkins was a very important doctor who helped make car racing, especially Formula 1, much safer for all the drivers. He worked in this job from 1978 to 2004. Because of his hard work, new safety rules were made, and many drivers' lives were saved after big accidents. Everyone who knew him liked him a lot, and he was a close friend of a famous race car driver named Ayrton Senna, who sadly died during a race.

Choose your answer from: [a]. follow the status quo; [b]. break the status quo;","completion":"Answer: Both solutions have their merits and drawbacks in the context of naive physics reasoning, as they depend on the specific situation and intended outcome. Let's dive into the details and analyze each option individually. [a]. Follow the status quo: In some instances, following the status quo can be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning as it often relies on tested and verified principles. This option is more conservative and involves maintaining established methodologies and practices to achieve the desired outcomes. By adhering to the status quo, one can benefit from the experience and knowledge accumulated over time. Advantages: 1. Proven methods: Established practices are often built upon a foundation of trial and error, which leads to the refinement of techniques over time. Naive physics reasoning may benefit from utilizing these existing methods. 2. Predictable outcomes: By adhering to the status quo, one can anticipate the results, thus reducing uncertainty and mitigating risk. This is important as naive physics reasoning relies on the expectation of predictable outcomes. 3. Stability: Maintaining the status quo contributes to stability within a particular domain, allowing practitioners to focus on honing their skills. Drawbacks: 1. Resistance to innovation: Adhering to the status quo may stifle creativity and discourage new ideas, which can hinder progress and overall improvement in naive physics reasoning. 2. Inefficient systems: The status quo may involve outdated or inefficient techniques, which can hinder overall productivity, potentially leading to resource waste. [b]. Break the status quo: In other cases, breaking the status quo can lead to more sound naive physics reasoning, as it encourages exploration, innovation, and the development of new methodologies. This option is more progressive, embracing change and adaptation to overcome potential limitations within existing practices. Advantages: 1. Innovation: Stepping away from the status quo opens the door to fresh ideas and innovative thinking, which can enhance naive physics reasoning by offering new perspectives. 2. Adaptability: Breaking the status quo fosters greater adaptability, a critical trait given the constantly evolving nature of many domains. This can enable naive physics reasoning to stay abreast of emerging advancements and trends. 3. Increased efficiency: Disrupting the status quo can lead to the reevaluation and optimization of existing processes, contributing to improved efficiency in naive physics reasoning and overall productivity. Drawbacks: 1. Risk of failure: Embracing change comes with risks, as new techniques may not yield desired results. In terms of naive physics reasoning, this can lead to uncertainty and potentially negative outcomes. 2. Loss of stability: Breaking the status quo can prompt periods of instability and necessitate a transitional phase during which individuals and organizations must adapt to new methods. Conclusion: Ultimately, the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning depends on the specific situation and desired objective. Following the status quo may be advisable in cases where proven methods and predictable outcomes are essential, while breaking the status quo may be the preferred option when seeking innovation and adaptability. It is crucial to weigh the advantages and drawbacks of each solution to determine the optimal course of action for the particular context and objective at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Watching the Super Bowl in San Quentin prison: 'It sort of hurts a little bit' It’s moments before kick-off, and the television in the offices of the San Quentin News, the inmate-produced newspaper of California’s San Quentin state prison, is tuned to the Super Bowl. But few of the approximately 20 men gathered in the cramped office are paying attention. They’re here for a college-level course on journalism, and not even the Super Bowl can distract them from the topic of the day: whether a journalist should allow the subject of a profile to read it before publication. “El Chapo did it,” one of the inmate-students points out. Everyone laughs, and a heated discussion of Sean Penn’s journalistic ethics ensues. Super Bowl Sunday in San Quentin is just like Super Bowl Sunday anywhere else: the day’s importance derives as much from the knowledge that it should be important as it does from the game itself. Some people watch the game, some people have money (or soup cans) riding on the outcome, and some people are just looking forward to the commercials, but everyone is talking about the fact that today is Super Bowl Sunday. “The Super Bowl is bigger than New Year’s Eve in prison,” says Chung Kao, as he sits in front of a computer in the newspaper office. “Everybody gets into it.” Except Kao himself does not get into the Super Bowl. The 55-year-old native of Taiwan has been in prison on a life sentence since 1992 – he shot and killed a man he says he thought was attacking him. “I used to celebrate my birthday and Chinese New Year, but I don’t want to celebrate any more. I don’t think I deserve to be happy,” he says. Part of this is the pain and regret he feels for taking a life. Part of it he describes as cultural, the guilt he feels for disappointing his family. “I’m their shame,” he says. There are approximately 3,000 inmates at San Quentin, all male. California’s oldest prison, the cluster of buildings occupies a peninsula that juts into the northern part of the San Francisco Bay, about 20 miles north of the city. Though it’s perhaps best known for housing California’s only death row and execution chamber, most of the prison is “Level 2” security, meaning inmates are free to move throughout the facility during the day. There are two types of housing for non-death-row inmates at San Quentin: cell blocks on top of the hill and dorms below. The dorms are largely inhabited by inmates with less than 10 years to go on their sentences. The cell blocks are full of lifers. As the first half of the game gets under way, the residents of North Block are all in their cells, startlingly small rooms with bunk beds, toilets, sinks, personal belongings, and two people shoehorned inside. Usually the block would be empty at this time of day, Juan Haines says, but everyone has returned to their cells to watch the game. Haines spends much of his time down the hill at the San Quentin News office – he’s the managing editor – but today is an exception. “My Super Bowl day is usually in my cell. I cook with my cellie,” he says, referring to his cell-mate. “It’s like family time.” The Super Bowl spread is indeed impressive. Haines and his cell-mate have prepared rice with meat logs, oysters, clams, garlic, onions, peppers, Velveeta, and spices. They’re also dining on fried chicken and corn chips. “We have big events in prison,” Haines says, such as the Day of Peace, which commemorates a 2007 race riot every May, and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in July. “But the Super Bowl is just the biggest.” For some inmates, the Super Bowl is bittersweet. Charles David Henry is one of the men hanging out in the newspaper office to give the game his full attention. A lifelong Oakland Raiders fan, Henry has been in prison for 11 years on an attempted murder charge, though he says: “I didn’t do it.” He played football in college at California State University-Los Angeles – “I was quick and fast and loved to hit” – and used to drive up to Oakland from his home in LA in an RV to attend games. “It sort of hurts a little bit,” he says. “You miss so many things that you take for granted on the streets. San Francisco is a rock’s throw from us, but we can’t participate.” These days, he’s the newspaper’s “death row man”. Reporters from the San Quentin News are not allowed to interview death row inmates, but Henry uses the library to read up on their cases and file briefs if he thinks they are warranted. He takes inspiration from Al Davis, the former owner and general manager of the Raiders. “Al Davis is my guy,” he says, “He never took what the system gave him. He always challenged it.” There’s a more traditional feel to the Super Bowl festivities in H-Unit, the dormitory-style wards at the bottom of the hill. Here, many of the inmates are younger, and they measure their sentences in months, not years. Related: Super Bowl 50: the newspaper front pages – in pictures In building five, about 100 men are housed in the bunk beds clustered at either end of the large, open room. In the middle of the room, a guard watches over several rows of wooden benches that face two televisions, and the open bathrooms behind them. It’s just like watching a sporting event with any other crowd of men, only quieter. Inmates have to plug their own earphones into the benches to hear the sound. Men joke about the presence of reporters (“Damn, people love this prison. It’s a tourist attraction”), Chris Martin (“they got a daughter named Apple”), and the commercials. The Doritos ad is a hit. Danyel McGee is mocked for singing along to Coldplay during the half-time show (“He likes Macklemore,” one inmate jokes. “I do like Macklemore,” McGee replies.) Another inmate takes his earphones off while Coldplay performs – “I’m not gonna lie, I’m not feeling this,” he says – but everyone sits up and pays attention when Beyoncé takes the stage. In the corner of the room, in the last row of bunk beds, Wayne, who asked not to be identified by his last name, is watching the game on his bed, alone. A cheery, middle-aged prisoner, he’s in prison for gross negligence vehicular manslaughter – killing someone while driving drunk. “On the street, we always had a big party with friends for the Super Bowl,” he says. “It was almost like Thanksgiving.” But he’s not in the mood to join the party in the middle of the room. “I enjoy being alone in prison. It’s nice to get lost in something,” he says. But he likes the commercials, and he likes to watch the game. “When you’re in prison, time is measured differently. Every day is Groundhog Day,” he says. “So these games are more of a milestone. You notice a full moon. You notice a Super Bowl.” Wayne lies back down on his bed and starts to put his earphones back in. “This is my fourth Super Bowl in prison.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article provides a glimpse into how inmates at California's San Quentin state prison experience the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is considered a significant event within the prison, with many inmates and staff participating in different ways. In San Quentin, Super Bowl Sunday operates similarly to other places with the celebration of the event being notable and the presence of a communal atmosphere. Chung Kao, one of the inmates interviewed, says, \\"The Super Bowl is bigger than New Year’s Eve in prison. Everybody gets into it.\\" Some of the inmates take part in Super Bowl parties within their cells and dormitories, sharing food and watching the game together. In H-Unit, the dormitory-style section of the prison, around 100 men are housed in an open room with rows of wooden benches facing two televisions. This shared experience is much like watching the event in other communal settings but considerably quieter, as inmates need to plug their earphones into the benches to hear the sound. However, amidst the celebrations and gatherings, certain inmates choose not to participate due to personal or emotional reasons. Some of them, like Chung Kao, feel they do not deserve to celebrate due to the circumstances of their incarceration. Others prefer solitude for various reasons, like Wayne, who says, \\"I enjoy being alone in prison. It's nice to get lost in something.\\" The Super Bowl's significance within the prison walls is also tied to the passage of time. Inmates often have a different perception of time, making events like the Super Bowl essential for marking milestones. As Wayne mentions, \\"When you're in prison, time is measured differently. Every day is Groundhog Day. You notice a full moon. You notice a Super Bowl.\\" Overall, the article highlights the importance of the Super Bowl in the lives of the inmates at San Quentin prison, demonstrating how it serves as a unifying and significant occasion for many prisoners."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.

Article: While steaming is the most common method used to cook momos, there are other ways to cook them. You can pan fry or deep fry them, or boil and serve them in a soup called mothuk. Fill your steamer pot with enough water to boil for several minutes. Set it over high heat. There is too much water in the pot if your steamer basket becomes submerged under the water once you set it in the pot. If you’ve used your steamer basket to keep your momos moist while shaping them, then you should be ready to go. If not, make sure to lightly grease your steamer basket with vegetable oil before setting your momos inside. This will keep them from sticking. Set the steamer basket over the boiling water and cover. Allow the momos to steam until they are done. The time it takes for them to cook will vary depending on the size of your momos. If you rolled your dough into balls by hand, your momos will likely be smaller than if you created your flat circles using a glass cup. For the smaller momos, let them steam for 5-6 minutes. For the larger momos, let them steam for closer to 10 minutes. Check the larger momos around 6 minutes to ensure they still need to cook for longer. Momos that are fully cooked will look transparent and will not feel sticky. Remove them from the steamer pan and sprinkle with the remaining scallions. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat the bottom of the pan with vegetable oil. Carefully place each momo in the pan so that they do not touch each other or the sides of the pan. Fry each until golden brown on both sides. You can use a deep pan to fry your momos, but they cook best in a deep fryer. Fill your pan or deep fryer with a generous amount of oil, and allow it to get hot. Check to see if the oil is hot enough by dropping a piece of dough into the oil. If it bubbles, you can now add your momos to the oil to cook. Allow the momos to fry for a few minutes on each side. Take them out of the oil when they’re done and set them on a paper towel to let the excess oil drain off. Momos are best served immediately and with a spicy sauce. The sauce can either be poured over the momo, or served on the side for dunking.

The statement is related to Australian rules football, which is a different sport altogether, and not to cricket. To appropriately answer the question, you should provide information about the first official Test cricket match at the MCG: The first official Test cricket match played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) took place from March 15 to 19, 1877. This historic match was contested between England, led by captain James Lillywhite, and Australia, led by captain Dave Gregory. The match now holds significant importance as it marked the beginning of international Test cricket, the highest and most prestigious level of the sport. The match had a time limit of four days, but an extra day was added due to several weather delays. The game concluded with Australia defeating England by 45 runs. As a result, Charles Bannerman, an Australian cricketer, became the first Test centurion, scoring 165 retired hurt. His incredible performance still stands as one of the defining moments in cricket history. Since then, the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted numerous memorable Test matches, establishing itself as one of the most iconic cricket venues globally. Additionally, the MCG continues to play a crucial role in Australian cricket with the iconic Boxing Day Test match hosted there every year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, the equation becomes: -15*f = -75 Step 2: Isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of f. The coefficient of f is -15. So, to isolate f, divide both sides of the equation by -15, as shown below: (-15*f) / -15 = -75 / -15 When we do the division, we get: f = 5 So the solution for the given equation -15*f = -8 - 67 is f = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son. The film ends with the village turning out to cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. We also see Krogh has a new false arm.

Article: Oprah is down more than 40 lbs.! The media guru is celebrating her weight loss success in the first of two new ads for Weight Watchers, shared with PEOPLE. “Since I’ve started Weight Watchers, I’ve lost over 40 lbs.,” Winfrey, 62, says in the ad. “I can honestly tell you, I struggle no more.” Not only can she can still eat her favorite food — bread — the program allows her to indulge in other treats that would typically be off-limits on a diet. “I’m eating everything I love — tacos, pasta. I’ve never felt deprived,” she says. Oprah Winfrey Weight Watchers Winfrey, who is a Weight Watchers shareholder, said that the program is less of a diet, and more of a life change. “Weight Watchers is easier than any other program I’ve ever been on,” she said in a press release shared with PEOPLE. “It’s a lifestyle, a way of eating and a way of living that’s so freeing. You never feel like you are on a diet and it works.” “I would say to anyone who’s thinking of joining Weight Watchers: Take the leap. And get about the business of enjoying a fantastic and full life,” Winfrey says in the commercial. She’ll share some of her favorite, Weight Watchers-friendly recipes in her new cookbook Food, Health and Happiness, out on Jan. 3, along with deeply personal stories about her weight loss journey. Since joining Weight Watchers in August 2015, Oprah has been steadily dropping pounds. By January 2016, she had lost 26 lbs. through healthy eating. She also kicked up her exercise routine, vowing in May to log at least 10,000 steps a day. “I try to do something every day that allows me to feel active, and I don’t make myself crazy about it,” she told PEOPLE. “I just know that movement and flexibility, particularly the older you get, is what makes you feel alive. So I don’t want to just be alive, I want to feel it.” ||||| Weight Watchers International Inc.’s stock got another boost from the falling weight of Oprah Winfrey, the company’s backer and most famous customer. The shares climbed as much as 19 percent after Winfrey announced that she’d lost 40 pounds using the program. The diet company, whose shares had fallen 54 percent this year before Thursday’s surge, is unveiling new TV ads featuring Winfrey that tout her weight loss. The media magnate and talk-show veteran became a centerpiece of Weight Watcher’s comeback plan last year when she bought a stake in the company and joined the board. In October 2015, when Weight Watchers first announced its deal with Winfrey, the shares more than doubled in a single day. Though the previous rally has faded, Winfrey’s subsequent endorsements of Weight Watchers have given the stock temporary jolts. The shares gained 27 percent over two days last December when Oprah tweeted a video about using the weight-loss program, and there was a 20 percent bump in January after Winfrey said she had lost 26 pounds while still eating bread every day. The latest marketing push begins next week, just before the New Year’s holiday. The coming weeks are critical for Weight Watchers: The company typically adds about 40 percent of new customers in the first quarter, when resolutions push people to seek out diets. The stock climbed as high as 12.50 on Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since February. Heavy Competition Weight Watchers has been hit hard by the rise of free fitness apps, and a move away from strict calorie counting among dieters. But Winfrey’s wide-ranging influence has brought new life to the brand. Weight Watchers has added subscribers for three straight quarters after years of declines. The New York-based company hopes that Winfrey’s new ads, which emphasize that she still enjoys pasta and tacos, will convince dieters that its updated program is an effective weight-loss tool. “It’s vitally important that Oprah is living the program and articulating it in a way that’s authentic,” said Maurice Herrera, the head of marketing at Weight Watchers. “It really connects with prospective members.” Despite the subscriber gains, it’s been a rocky year for Weight Watchers. The company has billions in debt, and its stock is heavily shorted. In September, Chief Executive Officer Jim Chambers announced he was leaving after about three years at the helm. That sent the shares plummeting to their lowest level in nearly a year. Interim CEO Chambers had been working to turn around the company, an effort that included revamping its nutrition program and adding a social-networking component to its app. Now, Weight Watchers is being run by a trio of executives who constitute the “interim office of the CEO.” The ads rolling out next week show Winfrey doing yoga and cooking pasta. As consumers have changed their perception of wellness, Weight Watchers has pivoted to emphasize that weight loss and indulgence aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Winfrey will hammer that message home, Herrera said. “People want to know what’s on her mind and how she’s living her life,” he said. “This will definitely get people’s attention.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or ideas in a text, article, or story. So, for this article, a summary would be: Oprah Winfrey has lost over 40 pounds using the Weight Watchers program. This program lets her eat her favorite foods while still losing weight.

Her weight loss journey has helped Weight Watchers become more popular, and they're making new commercials with Oprah to show how well the program works."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles.

Review: THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this would make eight movies. Although, that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.I spent many years trying to track down this movie. The synopses of the stories was so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when I eventually found a copy. As great as though the movie is, I did feel a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe. Whilst better than its two predecessors, it's nowhere near as good as its four successors as I shall demonstrate.The linking story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants. The linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house. Whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I couldn't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor man's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We could have even had both here - one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent. They could, and I believe would, have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better.The movie contains four stories, each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house.The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler, even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing. Soon after, he begins seeing visions of his own creation. Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell, particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script. Elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semi-twist but I couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential.The second story sees Peter Cushing move into the house. He is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of. Cushing's performance really brings this emotionally-moving story to life. He is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl. Naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing.The third story and easily the best sees Christopher Lee - my favourite horror actor of all time - move into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here. He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all. He even brings in a school governess to educate her. The governess, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her superb performances, tries to find out what is wrong. Without giving too much away, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie. The movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story.The final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies, seeing everything as cheap and fake, particularly the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak. When Pertwee puts the cloak on, he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire. Pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed. It truly is hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. The rest you'll be able to work out for yourself. As weak as the linking story is, it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending.I'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he's got. I think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies.Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. You'll enjoy it! Question: is it a negative review?","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clarifying the Record The defense of U.S. airspace on 9/11 was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols. It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records. Question: \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11\\" Answer: \\"NEADS\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer should be: \\"The inaccurate government accounts of those events, which made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question: If I wanted the gallery to be an equal distance from everyone, where might I put it? Here are possible answers to this question: - downtown area - middle of town - large city - london - lot of people I believe the correct choice is \\"middle of town\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Middle of Town Step 1: Understand the question and the context The question is asking for a location where the gallery should be placed so that it is an equal distance from everyone. This means that the ideal location would minimize the average distance between the gallery and all individuals. Step 2: Evaluate each option - Downtown area: A downtown area is often a concentrated business district, which might not necessarily be the center of a town or evenly distributed among the population. - Middle of town: This location usually refers to the central part of a town, which would most likely be more equidistant from all points within the town. People from different areas in the town can easily reach this point. - Large city: A large city may have several districts or areas, so placing the gallery in a large city does not provide enough information to determine the best location. - London: London is a specific city rather than a type of location. It is not possible to determine the equidistant location within London without more information about the distribution of the people. - Lot of people: This option refers to a population group but does not provide information regarding the location or distribution of people. Step 3: Determine the most suitable option Based on the analysis in step 2, \\"middle of town\\" would be the best option because it corresponds to the central part of the town, which is more likely to be equidistant from everyone. Justification: Choosing the middle of town as the location for the gallery would optimize its accessibility to more people by minimizing the average distance between the gallery and all individuals in the town. While other options may also provide good locations, the middle of town is the most plausible for achieving an equal distance for everyone without further context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. and the situation: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company.

After being held without a first down in the third quarter, the Patriots went ahead with a field goal in the fourth quarter, and capped the scoring with Tom Brady connecting with Julian Edelman for a 69-yard TD. San Diego was shut out in the second half. The win gave New England their 12th straight 10-win season, the second-longest such streak in NFL history. The Chargers led 14-3 after scoring twice within 2 minutes, 33 seconds in the second quarter. Floyd made a diving catch for a 15-yard TD, and safety Darrell Stuckey returned a fumble for a 53-yard score. After Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski's second field goal, Brandon Bolden blocked a punt by Scifres, and New England recovered the ball at the San Diego 28. Scifres was carted off the field after injuring his left shoulder on the play. Four plays later, Brady hit Rob Gronkowski on a 14-yard TD pass to trail 14-13. Before halftime, Te'o leaped for his first career interception on a pass intended for Gronkowski, preserving the Chargers' lead. In the third quarter, Devin McCourty returned a Rivers interception for a touchdown, but the play was wiped out by a personal foul on Brandon Browner for San Diego's Ladarius Green in the head. The Chargers' offense crossed midfield just once in the second half, getting as far as the Patriots 42.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Put the window well in the hole you dug and push it firmly against the walls of your foundation. Make sure that the edges of the sides of the well are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from either side of the window, and check that the top of the well extends 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) above the dirt. Set a level on top of the well to see if it's straight, and pack dirt underneath the lower side if you need to. Ask someone to help you lift and set the well in place if it's too heavy to safely lift on your own. If the window well is closer than 6 inches (15 cm) to your siding, dig your hole deeper until you have a 6 in (15 cm) buffer. Hold the window well tightly against your home and use a marker to put dots on your foundation in the center of each hole. Check that the window well doesn't shift around while you're making your marks or else the holes won't line up when you try to attach the well later on. After you draw all of the marks, take the window well out of the hole. If your window well doesn't already have holes drilled in the sides, then you may need to make your own holes. Use a 3⁄8 in (0.95 cm) drill bit meant for metal or plastic depending on what your well is made from, and space your holes about 5 inches (13 cm) apart down each side. 2 in (5.1 cm) pilot holes in the foundation with a masonry bit. Use a 3⁄8 in (0.95 cm) masonry bit in a hammer drill to cut through your foundation. Hold the drill bit straight against one of your marks on the foundation and turn it on to cut through the concrete. Make the holes about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep so the anchors can easily fit inside. Continue drilling holes at each of your marks along the foundation wall. Put on a pair of safety glasses so you don't get hurt while drilling the holes. You can use a regular rotary drill, but it will take longer and may damage the machine. Check your local hardware store to see if they rent hammer drills so you don't need to buy one. Use masonry anchors that are 3⁄8 in (0.95 cm) in diameter and 1 7⁄8 in (4.8 cm) long. Unscrew the nuts from the anchor sleeves and slide the sleeves into the holes you drilled. Position the window well in front of the sleeves and screw the nuts back into the sleeves. Tighten the nuts with a socket wrench so the window well stays firmly in place. You can buy masonry anchors from your local hardware store. Caulking around the sides can help seal the window well from water to prevent more leaks. Load the caulk into a dispenser and squeeze the trigger to apply it. Work around the sides of the window well with a thin line of caulk to seal it.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... Question: When do people generally seek help with their bowels?

Write a title for this article: Lava from a volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island is on course to reach a shopping centre with a gas station and a supermarket in seven to 10 days, officials said. Lava is about one mile from the shopping centre in the small town of Pahoa, the Hawaii County civil defence director, Darryl Oliveira, said Monday. The shopping centre also contains a hardware store, pharmacy and auto repair shop. There is still a great deal of uncertainty about when the lava might reach the centre and what it could hit. The lava could smother one structure in the complex or cover them all, he said. “It just depends on what the flow does as it comes through,” he told reporters during a conference call. Oliveira says the county has been in touch with the merchants about evacuation plans. The county has not yet advised them to leave. The supermarket, one of the biggest stores in the centre, plans to start removing equipment on Tuesday and shut down on Thursday. Malama Market said in a statement it was encouraging customers to keep shopping until its doors close. The gas station would sell its remaining fuel and pump out what is left over if it does have to evacuate, Oliveira said. It would then fill its tanks with water and firefighting foam. This plan has been approved the US Environmental Protection Agency and by the state department of health, he said. An earlier idea called for the gas station to put sand into the tanks, but this would not have removed all flammable vapours. It also would have destroyed the pumping system. By using firefighting foam, the gas station may use the tanks again if lava bypasses the area and it wants to reopen. Lava has never hit a gas station on the Big Island in the past, Oliveira said. Lava has been threatening Pahoa town, which has a population of about 900, for months. In October, it burned a house and covered part of a cemetery but stalled just before hitting Pahoa’s main road. It later started flowing from a different spot. The lava could still cross the town’s main road and a highway, which would make it more difficult for residents of Pahoa and the broader community of Puna to get to other parts of the island.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a band of frequencies: E1, ITU, or E5B?\\" is in \\"Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a band of frequencies: E1, ITU, or E5B?\\" is ITU. The passage provided states that the frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6, which overlap with the Galileo system. The ITU, or International Telecommunication Union, is not a band of frequencies. Instead, it is an organization responsible for regulating and coordinating the use of frequencies internationally. The ITU establishes policies to ensure that frequency allocation and usage are properly managed worldwide. In the case of the COMPASS and Galileo systems, the ITU policy dictates that the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency. As a result, China's COMPASS satellites, which began transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites, have primary rights to these frequency ranges. In summary, the ITU is not a band of frequencies, but an international organization responsible for overseeing the allocation and usage of frequencies. E1 and E5B are bands of frequencies used by both the COMPASS and Galileo satellite systems, with China's COMPASS having primary rights to these frequencies due to their earlier use under ITU policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's not because fish are endangered, though wild fish stocks in many oceans are very low. It's not because they're bad for you, though fish in many areas are exposed to poisonous substances in the water. It's because they're smart. \\"Fish are sensitive, they have personalities,\\" says the marine biologist. For Earle, eating a fish would be like eating a dog or a cat. \\"I would never eat anyone I know personally.\\" There's a lot more to fish than meets the eye: they talk to each other, they like to be touched, and they engage in behavior that can seem very human. They can remember things and learn from experience. Earle and a growing number of animal rights activists see these as strong arguments against eating fish altogether. The activists also point out that fish feel pain and fish suffer horribly on their way from the sea to the supermarket. \\"While it may seem _ that fish are able to feel pain, like every other animal, some people think of fish as swimming vegetables,\\" says Dr. Lynne Sneddon. \\"Really, it's kind of a moral question.

Q:The answer to the question: Where does the original owner of the weaving company live? is inside the article: A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

Mother, 26, went to hospital on Friday saying she had had a miscarriage. She has been arrested and has told officers she could not afford an abortion. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Abandoned Baby Found Alive Under Manhole Cover in Alicante; Mother Arrested Introduction In a shocking incident, a two-day-old baby was found clinging to life, wrapped in plastic bags, and hidden under a manhole cover in Alicante, Spain. The baby, who might have been there for 40 hours, was discovered only after a concerned neighbor called the firefighters, believing that a meowing cat was stuck in the sewer. The discovery led to the arrest of the baby's mother, a 26-year-old woman who claimed she could not afford an abortion and had suffered a miscarriage. The Discovery of the Baby The incident unfolded on Sunday, in a quiet neighborhood of Alicante. A concerned resident heard what appeared to be a cat's meowing coming from a manhole and alerted the local firefighters. Upon arriving at the scene, the firefighters lifted the manhole cover and were astonished to find a defenseless newborn tightly wrapped in plastic bags with its mouth taped shut, gasping for air. The baby was immediately rushed to a local hospital, where it remains in critical but stable condition. The Mother and Her Arrest Following the discovery of the baby, an investigation was launched by the Spanish National Police to locate the mother. Hospital records revealed that a 26-year-old woman was admitted on Friday, claiming to have suffered a miscarriage. However, doctors found evidence of a recent full-term pregnancy without complications. The woman confessed to having concealed and abandoned her baby, alleging she could not afford an abortion. She was arrested and is being held in custody while the authorities continue their investigation. The Legal Abortion System in Spain The incident sheds light on the challenges that many women face when seeking an abortion in Spain. The country legalized abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy in 2010. However, women are required to undergo extensive counseling and observe a waiting period of three days before the procedure can be carried out. Additionally, the costs associated with the process are not covered by the public healthcare system, making access to safe and legal abortions a significant challenge for women with limited financial resources. Community Response and Child Protection The harrowing story of the abandoned baby has deeply impacted the community in Alicante. Local residents have expressed their shock and disbelief at the tragic turn of events and are questioning the role that society played in this dreadful incident. The incident has led to discussions about advocating for stronger support systems for women experiencing an unplanned pregnancy and providing greater access to affordable reproductive healthcare services. The future of the child remains uncertain, and it will ultimately be up to Spanish child protection services to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, the infant is receiving the necessary medical care and attention, and the community is rallying around this innocent life with an outpouring of love and support. Conclusion The story of the abandoned baby in Alicante underscores the urgent need for systemic changes in reproductive health services, particularly for women with limited financial means. The incident has prompted public discourse surrounding the barriers to safe and affordable abortions in Spain and has called for a greater focus on providing necessary support to women in vulnerable situations. As investigations continue, one can only hope that this tragic event will serve as a catalyst for positive reform in the nation's reproductive health policies and social support systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town.When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition.By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats.

Choices: - knell - kneel down - talk to god - talking to god - ask for help The rationale to choose \\"talking to god\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Praying is considered a form of communication with a higher power, specifically God or gods, depending on one's religious beliefs. In various religious practices, prayers can take different forms, such as reciting specific prayers, rituals, or spontaneous expressions of gratitude, praise, intercession, or confession. The act of praying generally involves addressing the higher power and can include requests for assistance or spiritual guidance, expressions of thanks, or asking for forgiveness. Out of the given choices, the most appropriate answer is \\"talking to god,\\" and there are several reasons behind this choice: 1. Direct communication: Praying is often viewed as an opportunity for believers to have a direct line of communication with God, which emphasizes the relational aspect of the interaction. \\"Talking to god\\" signifies this conversational exchange between the faithful and their deity. 2. Active engagement: By choosing \\"talking to god,\\" it acknowledges that praying is an active engagement between the believer and their higher power, rather than just a passive act. This description captures the heart of the communication process that happens during prayer. 3. Relational aspect: Prayer, as a form of communication with God, underscores the relational nature of faith. Believers often feel a close and personal connection with their higher power, and \\"talking to god\\" highlights this bond. 4. Universality: While specific practices, rituals, and methods may differ across various faiths, the act of \\"talking to god\\" through prayer is a consistent element in many religious traditions. This answer choice, therefore, is suitable for capturing the essence of prayer across these diverse belief systems. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"talking to god\\" as the answer lies in the understanding that prayer is a form of communication between believers and their deity. This answer choice emphasizes the active engagement and relational aspects of prayer, as well as its universality across various religious traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation, we should first simplify both sides by combining like terms. Here's the equation: -146*j + 46*j = -416*j - 59*j + 34500 Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. Left side: -146*j and 46*j are like terms. -146*j + 46*j = (-146 + 46) * j = -100*j Right side: -416*j and -59*j are like terms. -416*j - 59*j = (-416 - 59) * j = -475*j Now, the simplified equation is: -100*j = -475*j + 34500 Step 2: Move the variable terms (j) to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 475*j to both sides of the equation: -100*j + 475*j = -475*j + 34500 + 475*j This simplifies to: 375*j = 34500 Step 3: Solve for j by dividing both sides by 375. j = 34500 / 375 j = 92 So the answer is j = 92."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Spirited Away Movie plot: Ten-year-old Chihiro (voice: Daveigh Chase in the 2002 English dub) and her parents (voices: Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) drive to their new home. Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to dispute an insurance claim denial Understand why insurers typically deny claims. Claims can be denied for a variety of reasons. Not every denial will apply to each form of insurance.","completion":"Some common reasons for denial include incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the policyholder, failure to properly file the claim, the incident not being covered by the policy, exceeding benefit limits, and non-payment of premiums. To effectively dispute an insurance claim denial, it is crucial for policyholders to familiarize themselves with the specific terms and conditions of their insurance policy, as well as the company's claims process, in order to pinpoint the cause of the denial and address the issue accordingly. First and foremost, carefully review the denial letter from the insurance company. This letter typically contains information regarding why the claim was denied and provides specific steps or actions needed to rectify the situation. It's essential to thoroughly read and understand this letter, as it will serve as a valuable guide in resolving the issue. If anything in the letter is unclear, do not hesitate to reach out to the insurance company for clarification. Next, gather all necessary documentation related to your claim, such as medical records, photos of a damaged property, or police reports in case of an accident. This information can be crucial in supporting your case should any discrepancies exist between your records and the insurer's findings. Additionally, having all pertinent documents organized and readily accessible will expedite your appeal process. If you believe that your insurance claim was denied due to an error on the insurer's part or a misunderstanding of the situation, contact your insurance company's claim representative immediately to discuss your concerns. Be calm, polite, and assertive in presenting your case, as this will increase the likelihood of reaching a satisfactory resolution. Provide additional information or documentation to support your claim, if necessary. In some cases, it might be beneficial to consult with an insurance professional, such as an agent or broker, who can offer insights into the industry's best practices and guide you in resolving the denial. They may be able to identify specific areas where your claim could be strengthened or may even intervene on your behalf by contacting the insurance company directly. If all attempts to resolve the claim denial through direct communication with the insurer remain fruitless, policyholders can choose to file a formal appeal with the insurance company. This process typically involves submitting a written request detailing the reason for the dispute, and providing all relevant documentation to substantiate your claim. Additionally, it's crucial to keep track of all communication with the insurance company, including emails, letters, and notes from phone conversations, as well as copies of submitted documents, to have a well-documented history of the dispute process. Lastly, if the dispute fails to yield a satisfactory outcome, policyholders might consider taking legal action, such as hiring an attorney who specializes in insurance claims and pursuing litigation. Keep in mind, however, that this option can be time-consuming and financially taxing, so it should be used as a last resort to challenge a claim denial. In summary, disputing an insurance claim denial requires a thorough understanding of the insurer's reasons for the denial, careful review of the policy's terms and conditions, consistency in gathering supporting documentation, and persistence in communication with the insurance company. By taking a proactive and well-informed approach, policyholders can increase their chances of successfully disputing a claim denial and securing the coverage they rightfully deserve."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Why would you be unable to use a basketball?

Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - A snipe is any of about 25 wading bird species in three genera in the family Scolopacidae. They are characterized by a very long, slender bill and crypsis, or camouflage, plumage. The \\"Gallinago\\" snipes have a nearly worldwide distribution, the \\"Lymnocryptes\\" snipe is restricted to Asia and Europe and the \\"Coenocorypha\\" snipes are found only in the Outlying Islands of New Zealand. The three species of painted snipe are not closely related to the typical snipes, and are placed in their own family, the Rostratulidae. - The woodcocks are a group of seven or eight very similar living species of wading birds in the genus Scolopax . Only two woodcocks are widespread , the others being localized island endemics . Most are found in the Northern Hemisphere but a few range into the Greater Sundas , Wallacea and New Guinea . Their closest relatives are the typical snipes of the genus Gallinago . - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

Turkish authorities have detained American activist and freelance journalist Jake Hess in the southeastern, predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. At a court appearance Sunday, a prosecutor charged Hess with \\"taking orders from a terrorist organization\\" and called for his immediate deportation from Turkey, witnesses said. Turkish officialdom regularly refers to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, as a terrorist organization. U.S. diplomats say Hess rejected their offer of assistance after he was taken into custody. \\"We have spoken with him on the phone regarding his situation, and he specifically asked us not to share any information on his case,\\" said Deborah Guido, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. \\"He did not sign a privacy waiver. We can take an oral privacy waiver [by phone], and it was his choice. He did not want to be helped.\\" Asked why he rejected the American offer, Hess answered that \\"the U.S. is an imperialist country, and I disagree with U.S. policy towards Turkey and the Kurds. It would be hypocritical to support an American journalist who is persecuted for human rights journalism while at the same time supporting the Turkish policy of criminalizing Kurdish political activists.\\" Hess spoke with CNN by telephone on Monday from the detention center in Diyarbakir. He said he was initially detained by a Turkish anti-terrorist police unit on August 11. \\"I am being targeted for criticizing the Turkish government and criticizing human rights abuses,\\" he said. \\"The prosecutor accused me of waging a smear campaign against the Turkish republic.\\" Turkish officials in Diyarbakir and in the capital, Ankara, have declined to comment on Hess' case. The 25-year old American said he hoped his detention would focus attention on the arrest of hundreds of ethnic Kurds in recent years, including elected mayors from Turkey's Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), a Kurdish nationalist political party. \\"Some of these people have been in custody since April 2009 without trial,\\" he said. \\"It's an absolutely unbelievable and outrageous injustice.\\" Hess is a native of New Hampshire who studied at Suffolk University and Brown University. He said he previously volunteered as an activist with several Kurdish activist organizations in Europe and in Turkey. After moving to Diyarbakir more than a year ago, Hess volunteered with the Human Rights Association (IHD), a local non-governmental organization that has reported extensively on abuses committed against ethnic Kurds during Turkey's quarter-century long war with PKK guerrillas. More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. Hess had also begun writing as a freelance journalist with the online Inter Press Service news agency, filing a report this month from Iraqi Kurdistan about periodic Turkish and Iranian artillery bombardment of Kurdish villages on the Iraqi side of the border. Hess denied charges that he was an active accomplice to the PKK, which is formally classified by the Turkish and U.S. governments as a terrorist organization. \\"The only relationship I had with the PKK was maybe two months ago, when I went to northern Iraq and interviewed a PKK spokesman there,\\" Hess said. Media watchdog organizations are demanding Hess's release. \\"We call for Hess's immediate release. Neither placing him in pre-trial detention nor deporting him are appropriate solutions,\\" said the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders in a statement. \\"Kurdish media and journalists who cover the consequences of Turkish policy towards the Kurds are too often the target of harassment, which the authorities clumsily try to justify as a necessary part of their efforts to combat terrorism.\\" Turkish police also briefly detained several other residents of Diyarbakir in connection with Hess's case, including Yilmaz Akinci, a respected Kurdish journalist who has worked with Reuters, National Public Radio, ABC News and CNN, and who is now a producer with Al Jazeera's Arabic language service. Akinci said Hess approached him in June, looking for work. \\"He had been applying for jobs everywhere,\\" Akinci said. \\"He came to me and said, 'I want to be a journalist.' \\" Turkish police detained Akinci at his family's home in a predawn raid Sunday. He said he later learned that security forces had secretly photographed him during his earlier meeting with Hess. Akinci said he was released later Sunday, after authorities learned that he was a journalist. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

To isolate 't', we need to move +20 to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 20 from both sides. This gives us -5*t = -20, because 0 - 20 equals -20. Step 3: Solve for 't'.

Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside.

As the chisel bit into the wood, small shavings curled away from the surface, revealing the fresh wood beneath. This process continued as the carpenter used the sharp chisel to shape intricate designs and patterns into the wood, transforming it from a simple piece of raw material into a functional and beautiful object. The sharpness of the chisel was essential to achieve such intricate cuts and grooves in the wood, as a blunt or dull chisel would have led to frustration and a lack of precision, thereby compromising the finished product's overall aesthetic and function. Proper maintenance of the chisel, including steady sharpening and oiling to prevent rust, was vital to ensure it remained sharp and ready for use. In addition to the sharp chisel, the carpenter also relied on his years of experience and skill, carefully selecting the appropriate type and thickness of wood for the project. The wood needed to be sturdy and strong, yet able to bend and flex as required under the craftsman's touch. Each piece of wood was unique, with its natural grain patterns and imperfections adding character and charm to the finished work. The choice of wood also had a direct impact on the final product's appearance, as different woods offered distinct colors, densities, and workability. The carpenter's ability to use a sharp chisel to cut the wood was not only a testament to the quality of the tools he utilized but also the skill and mastery of his craft. The knowledge and understanding of how to wield the chisel and work with the wood played a crucial role in the successful completion of his wooden masterpieces. In conclusion, the carpenter could use a chisel to cut the wood because the chisel was sharp, enabling him to make precise and accurate cuts that showcased his exceptional woodworking abilities.

They are subtracted, so perform the operation to simplify: -315 - 522 equals -837. Thus, the equation simplifies to: 1179 = 56*t - 837 To isolate the term with 't' (which is 56*t), the number -837 should be moved from the right side to the left by performing the opposite operation. Since -837 is subtracted on the right side, it will be added when moved to the left: 1179 + 837 = 56*t Calculate the sum of 1179 and 837, which equals 2016: 2016 = 56*t Now, to solve for 't', the coefficient alongside 't' should be isolated. Since 56 is multiplying with 't', it should be divided on both sides of the equation to isolate 't': 2016 / 56 = t Calculate the quotient of 2016 and 56, which equals 36: t = 36 Thus, the solution to the equation 1179 = 56*t - 315 - 522 is t = 36."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: The parents of a former Seneca Valley High School student claim in a federal lawsuit filed this week that their teenage son was terrorized by false accusations made by five \\"Mean Girls\\" at the school. Michael J. and Alecia Flood of Zelienople, Butler County, the parents of a teenage boy identified in the lawsuit as T.F., seek unspecified civil damages against the girls' parents, the school district and Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger's office. The lawsuit alleges that the girls \\"conspired in person and via electronic communication devices to falsely accuse T.F. of sexual assault on two occasions.\\" Neither Goldinger nor Seneca Valley school officials returned calls seeking comment. The 26-page lawsuit -- filed in Pittsburgh on the eve of Mean Girls Day -- alleges that T.F. \\"was forced to endure multiple court appearances, detention in a juvenile facility, detention at home, the loss of his liberty and other damages until several of the girls reluctantly admitted that their accusations were false\\" this summer. The lawsuit contends that T.F. was bullied on multiple occasions by classmates. In one example, the lawsuit said students last year placed masking tape with the word \\"PREDATOR\\" written on it on his back without his knowledge during choir practice. The lawsuit alleges that the boy was further damaged by \\"gender bias\\" by school officials and Goldinger's office, which even after learning the girls' accusations were false \\"did not take any action against the females involved,\\" said attorney Craig Fishman of Pittsburgh, who represents the Floods. \\"(T.F.) was basically being tortured in school by the other students and investigators, but the administration was only focused on protecting the girls who were lying,\\" Fishman said. \\"Once the allegations were proven false, they really didn't care one bit about T.F. and there has been absolutely no repercussions against the girls.\\" The teen boy is being home-schooled, Fishman said. According to the lawsuit, the first allegation occurred in July 2017 at an area swimming pool where T.F. worked as a lifeguard with then Seneca Valley High School graduate Megan Villegas, who is the only teenage defendant named in the lawsuit. The others are minor and are referred to only by initials, Fishman said. Villegas could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit contends that T.F. was charged with sexually assaulting a girl identified in the lawsuit at K.S. on the pool premises, and Villegas corroborated K.S. claim by saying she was present during the alleged assault. \\"T.F. was fired at the pool,\\" Fishman said. In tape-recorded interview with school officials in 2017, the lawsuit alleges that K.S. said she made the sexual assault claim against T.F. because \\"I just don't like him.\\" \\"I just don't like to hear him talk ... I don't like to look at him,\\" K.S. reportedly disclosed in the recorded interview obtained by Fishman. On Oct. 2, 2017, K.S. told fellow students \\"that she would do anything to get T.F. expelled ... and accused T.F. of sexual assault\\" with school officials, the lawsuit states. T.F. was subsequently charged in juvenile court with indecent assault and two counts of harassment. The Floods eventually agreed in late 2017 to a consent decree where he would not admit guilt, but was required to stay out of trouble for six months and report to the county probation department. In March, another girl -- identified as C.S. and a friend of K.S. -- reported to a school counselor that the boy had walked into her home uninvited and sexually assaulted her. The allegations were supported by information from two other girls, identified as E.S. and H.R., according to the lawsuit. On April 9, Zelienople police charged T.F. with indecent assault, criminal trespass and simple assault. \\"On April 10, T.F. was removed from class at Seneca Valley High School and placed in leg and wrist shackles by the Jackson Township Police with the assistance of Juvenile Probation Officer Michael Trego,\\" the lawsuit said. Trego testified at a hearing that T.F. was a threat to the community and the teenager had to spend nine days in a juvenile detention center before being released on home-electronic monitoring. \\"After 28 days, T.F. was only allowed out of his home to mow his lawn,\\" the lawsuit contends. During the case, T.F. was told by school officials he could not play baseball \\"because every time he was wearing a Seneca Valley jersey, he was representing a school.\\" According to the lawsuit, the criminal complaints against the boy began unravelling in May when three of the witnesses admitted they lied. On Aug. 30, Goldinger's office sought an order dismissing all charges against T.F. filed for the March allegation due to the false reports, according to court documents. On Sept. 10, the charges in connection with swimming pool incident in 2017 also were ordered closed, according to the lawsuit. \\"The Butler County District Attorney's office promised to file a petition to expunge the record of T.F. in September, but has not yet done so, providing further evidence of gender-based discrimination. The (district attorney) has refused to file criminal charges against K.S., Villegas, C.S., E.S. and H.R. due to gender-based discrimination,\\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also claims school officials have repeatedly refused to mark the academic records of the girls who lied about the assaults. \\"T.F. has had psychological trauma because of all this. He's had to see a psychologist to deal with the physical symptoms which are the direct result of being accused of something when when he did not do anything wrong,\\" Fishman said. ||||| Sign up for one of our email newsletters. The Seneca Valley student section wore blue Friday to honor seniors on the football field, in the band and on the cheerleading squad. But some students at NexTier Stadium in Harmony for the game against Hempfield Area High School also used the night to publicly show support for a former classmate who, according to a lawsuit filed by his parents, was wrongly accused of sexual assault. Referred to only as “T.F.” in court documents, the former Seneca Valley High School student was accused of assaulting two female classmates last year. Now, Michael J. and Alecia Flood of Zelienople, Butler County, have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that their son was terrorized by five “mean girls” — a phrase used in the lawsuit — who made those accusations. Several student fans wrote or taped phrases such as “We Stand 4 Flood” on the back of their shirts. Similar phrases were also used on Twitter to show support. “We wanted to get behind them and show that we support them,” Zach Brown, 18, a Seneca Valley senior, said of students’ efforts to support the teen and his family. Brown said he runs the Seneca Valley Student Section Twitter account, where a call to support the family was posted Thursday. “Reading this story makes me sick to my stomach,” the post said, linking to a Trib story from Wednesday describing the lawsuit filed by the Floods. “This Friday we will show our support for the entire Flood family by putting #WeStand4Flood on the back of our Blue Out Shirts to support this amazing family!! #WeStand4Flood.” The account description for the student section, which posts from the Twitter handle @SVStudntSection, says the account is led by students and not affiliated with Seneca Valley High School. Brown and classmate Adam Baer, 18, also a senior, said students also are using the hashtag #SupportTheTruth in an effort to tap into national conversations around the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Several women have publicly accused Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court nominated by President Trump in July, of sexual assault. The Senate is expected to vote on his confirmation this weekend. “We want to get to the bottom of it, regardless of what the outcome is,” said Baer, who added that he hopes the public will not jump to conclusions about the allegations of assault made against T.F. “We’re not picking sides over ‘he said, she said,’” Brown said. The 26-page lawsuit filed in Pittsburgh alleges T.F. “was forced to endure multiple court appearances, detention in a juvenile facility, detention at home, the loss of his liberty and other damages until several of the girls reluctantly admitted that their accusations were false.” The Floods seek unspecified civil damages against the girls’ parents, the school district and Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger’s office. Mya Orgovan, 18, a senior at Seneca Valley High School, taped “Justice 4 Flood” to the back of her shirt Friday night. “I’ve always known him to be such a sweet guy,” Orgovan said. Orgovan said that she’s talked about the lawsuit and assault allegations with her friends. She hopes that T.F. is treated fairly. Hempfield fans react Fans in the Hempfield Area visitors’ section also weighed in on the lawsuit as well as bullying in their school community. Robin Highlands, a Hempfield Area graduate and special education teacher at Logan Elementary School in the East Allegheny School District, read about the lawsuit. “It’s sad if the boy was innocent and the girls truly made this story up,” she said, adding that she would be sick if her nephews were blamed for something they didn’t do. “His name is still defamed, and that’s not fair to him.” She said the girls should face some type of punishment if, as they are accused in the lawsuit, the accusations they made are untrue. Sarah Hayden, 16, a Hempfield Area sophomore, said some kids may get picked on for their clothes or if they’re in different groups, but she’s never heard of anything like what was alleged to have happened at Seneca Valley. “For some kids it is rough,” she said. “Whether the way they dress or the way they look, they’ll just get picked on for no reason besides the fact that someone doesn’t like something about their appearance or their personality. They’ll nitpick little things. They’ll get their friends, and once one person in a friend group doesn’t like a person, everyone doesn’t like them, and you’re (excluded) from it.” She said her school has a tip line and other programs to address bullying. If someone makes up stories about another student, she thinks that they should get punished. Sarah’s mother, Amy Hayden, a 1987 Hempfield Area graduate, said bullying has gotten worse since she was in school, in part because of the internet. “Social media’s the downfall,” she said. Sarah’s aunt, Janice Manley, a 1986 Hempfield Area graduate, also thinks times have changed. “I don’t remember anyone being as mean as they are now,” she said. “It’s completely different.” Jamie Martines and Mike DiVittorio are Tribune-Review staff writers.

Options are: (A). yes; (B). no;","completion":"(A). Yes, the statement you provided is indeed the correct answer. In September 1828, Chopin, then a student, visited Berlin along with a family friend named Feliks Jarocki, who was a zoologist. During his time in Berlin, Chopin had the opportunity to enjoy operas directed by Gaspare Spontini. Spontini was an Italian composer and conductor, who was particularly famous during the late 18th and early 19th centuries for his operas. In fact, Gaspare Spontini was one of the highly influential composers in Europe at that time. In addition to attending Spontini's operas, Chopin also had the chance to attend concerts by other notable figures in the music world, such as Carl Friedrich Zelter and Felix Mendelssohn. Carl Friedrich Zelter was a German composer, conductor, and teacher, who was both a significant character in and essential contributor to the choral music culture in Berlin. Felix Mendelssohn, another acclaimed composer and pianist from Germany, was a leading figure of the Romantic period whose works are widely performed and appreciated today. Chopin's exposure to the artistry of these prominent musicians in Berlin certainly played a role in shaping his own musical development, contributing to the rich and emotional style that would come to define his future compositions. This exposure could have had an impact on his creativity and understanding of various aspects within the realm of music. Consequently, this visit to Berlin can be seen as a valuable learning experience for Chopin as he continued to cultivate his skills as a composer and pianist."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Austin gave candy to people around him at school because he got too much at his birthday.

Observers say his comments reflect acknowledgment of the lack of progress in defeating the militant group. Separately, Iran says it is considering whether to attend international talks in Vienna this week on Syria's war. Earlier, the US said Iran - an ally of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad - was being invited to the talks for the first time. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said \\"Iran's participation is under discussion\\", Iranian news agencies reported. Mr Carter's comments, made to the Senate Armed Services Committee, come a week after US-Iraqi forces rescued dozens of hostages held by IS in Iraq. Russia's intervention in Syria has changed the military and diplomatic dynamic in the crisis and left Washington struggling to catch up. Whatever the inconsistencies in Moscow's own policies, it has highlighted the deficiencies in Washington's approach - not least the collapse of its ailing train-and-equip programme for Syria that was largely going nowhere. US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter wants a more active US strategy, but this inevitably runs counter to the prevailing mood in the White House. Barack Obama, after all, has cast his presidency as one that will withdraw US troops from foreign wars, not engage in new ones. There is talk of deploying a small number of Apache attack helicopters to Iraq. That could involve hundreds of extra US personnel. But US success still requires effective local allies on the ground and they are in short supply. \\"We won't hold back from supporting capable partners in opportunistic attacks against ISIL or conducting such missions directly, whether by strikes from the air or direct action on the ground,\\" Mr Carter said, using an alternative acronym for IS. \\"We expect to intensify our air campaign, including with additional US and coalition aircraft, to target ISIL with a higher and heavier rate of strikes,\\" he said. \\"This will include more strikes against ISIL high-value targets as our intelligence improves.\\" A US-led coalition began air strikes against IS positions in Iraq and Syria last year. President Barack Obama said the objective was to \\"degrade and ultimately destroy\\" IS. Although President Obama has not committed ground forces to Iraq, the US has about 3,500 troops in the country who have been helping to train Iraqi forces and also have a limited combat role. Russia started its own air strikes in Syria at the end of last month, saying it wants to help President Bashar al-Assad defeat IS and other extremists. But Washington has strongly criticised the Russian campaign, arguing that it has been focused on rebel opposition fighters and that it will only fuel more extremism. Mr Carter said the fight against IS would now concentrate mostly on Raqqa, the militants' declared capital in Syria, and Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province in western Iraq. He did not divulge the circumstances under which the US might carry out operations on the ground on its own. \\"[But] once we locate them, no target is beyond our reach,\\" he said. Foreign ministers from the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are due to meet in Vienna on Thursday evening, a Russian diplomatic source said, with Iran possibly joining further talks on Friday. Friday's talks could also include officials from Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called for a \\"widening of the dialogue\\" on Syria, when he spoke to reporters on Wednesday. Iran is believed to have spent billions of dollars over the past four years propping up President Assad's government, providing military advisers and subsidised weapons, as well as lines of credit and oil. It is also thought to have been influential in the decision of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement to send fighters to Syria to assist pro-Assad forces. Syria's Western-backed opposition and the US's Gulf Arab allies have long opposed Iran's role in the Syrian war. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says that while Washington is certainly not welcoming Iran to the Syria talks, it will now tolerate Tehran's involvement. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \\"moderate\\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. What's the human cost? More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.

Nabeel Rajab published on his Facebook page images of a man identified as Ali Isa Saqer. The man in the picture has multiple cuts on his front and back and heavy bruising across his body and face. Saqer, 31, died at a detention center Saturday, according to the general director of Muharraq Governorate Police. He was being held on charges of attempted murder of policemen while trying to run them over with his car on March 13. The government confirmed","completion":"Saqer's death, but claims that the injuries displayed in the photograph were not a result of abuse while in custody, and have accused Rajab of fabricating and disseminating false information to tarnish the authorities' reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: In the 11th century, Gascony in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony . The Angevin kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous. At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine. For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword. Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration. Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court. Who provided intelligence on the French court?","completion":"Robert III of Artois provided intelligence on the French court."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a premise: I looked at the next tube along. Here is a hypothesis: I was anxious to see who was in the next tube. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, let's examine the statements step by step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states, \\"I looked at the next tube along.\\" This implies that the speaker is directing their attention to the next tube, presumably to observe its contents or understand something about it. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"I was anxious to see who was in the next tube.\\" This implies that the speaker had a heightened sense of curiosity or concern about the tube's contents, specifically, the person or entity inside. Step 3: Analyze the connection between the premise and hypothesis In this case, the premise describes an action (looking at the next tube) while the hypothesis explains a potential motivation for that action (anxiety about the contents). The hypothesis could be the reason behind the action taken in the premise, but it isn't the only possible explanation. Step 4: Test if the premise can lead to the hypothesis conclusively The act of looking at the next tube might be motivated by various reasons, such as curiosity, concern, or even boredom. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine that the speaker's anxiety was the sole reason for looking at the next tube. There could be other emotions or factors at play. Conclusion: While it is possible that the hypothesis is true, we cannot definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, as there are other potential explanations for the action described in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Beyonce Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine \\"Tina\\" Knowles (nee Beyince), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyonce's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyonce's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former back up dancer for Destiny's Child. Context: Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \\"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\\". Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonce's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\\" Beyonce's music is generally R&B, but she also incorporates pop, soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonce's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonce recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonce was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez. She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \\"Independent Women\\" and \\"Survivor\\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \\"Cater 2 U\\". Beyonce has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers. In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards. Beyonce was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\\"Irreplaceable\\", \\"Grillz\\" and \\"Check on It\\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles. (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \\"I Was Here\\" for 4.) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonce at number 17 on their list of the \\"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift. Question: did anyone else have anything to say about her voice? good or bad. Answer:","completion":"Beyoncé's voice has been widely praised by both critics and her peers in the music industry, although there might be some who may have differing opinions, the overall consensus is that her voice is extraordinary. In addition to the comments mentioned in the context provided, several other critics and musicians have also expressed admiration for her vocal abilities. Celebrated singer and songwriter Adele once referred to Beyoncé as “Jesus F****** Christ” in awe of her performance at the Grammys and shared that her album \\"Lemonade\\" was \\"so monumental.\\" Stevie Wonder, an iconic musician himself, has called Beyoncé's voice \\"amazing\\" and said, \\"She's just a beautiful woman with a great voice, and she deserves all the accolades that she gets.\\" Vocal coach and author James Lugo shared his professional insight, stating that Beyoncé has \\"an iron larynx\\" and is an \\"amazing vocalist with tremendous technique and control.\\" Rolling Stone has also ranked Beyoncé as one of the greatest singers of all time, positioning her at number 33 out of 100 on their list. In terms of criticism, some have argued that Beyoncé's voice might not be as emotionally expressive or distinctive as other singers. Music writer James Masterton, for instance, described her voice as \\"emotionally brittle\\" in comparison to another powerhouse vocalist, Adele. However, such detractors are in the minority, and the general consensus among critics and musicians alike is that Beyoncé's voice is exceptionally powerful and versatile. In conclusion, the majority of people who have commented on Beyoncé's voice, including music critics, vocal coaches, and fellow musicians, have praised her vocal capabilities. There might be a few dissenting opinions out there, but they are overshadowed by the numerous positive remarks on her unique and powerful voice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th C. not enough information D. After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment Answer:","completion":"B.

What is the answer: What is the lowest note on a common traditional four-string mandolin?","completion":"The lowest note on a commonly used traditional four-string mandolin can be determined by considering the standard tuning and finding the pitch of the lowest open string. The standard tuning for a traditional four-string mandolin is G3-D4-A4-E5. This tuning follows a pattern of fifths, which is typical for many stringed instruments. Here, G3 represents the lowest string (the one closest to the player's face when the mandolin is held correctly), D4 is the second-lowest, A4 is the third-lowest, and E5 is the highest string. Given these pitches, the lowest note on a traditional four-string mandolin in standard tuning is G3. This particular G note is the G that lies just below Middle C (C4) on a piano keyboard and has a frequency of approximately 196 Hz. This tuning allows the mandolin to play within a range of just over three octaves and cover a variety of musical styles, particularly those found in traditional European and American folk music. Of course, it's worth noting that alternative tunings exist for the mandolin, and some players may elect to deviate from the standard G3-D4-A4-E5 in order to achieve different tonal characteristics or facilitate specific techniques. However, in the context of common traditional mandolin usage and standard tuning, G3 is the lowest note that can be played on the open strings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces. Which candidate is Troy less likely to vote for? Answer:","completion":"Troy is less likely to vote for Mark Hampton. The reason is that Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes taking care of the Earth is the top priority. Mark Hampton's proposal focuses on boosting the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, which would increase carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, Jeffrey Lindell's proposal aims to implement solar panel farms to generate electricity and reduce carbon emissions, which aligns better with Troy's environmental values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once at the heart of the Silk Road trade route, Herat in western Afghanistan has a long tradition of producing silk used to weave carpets and silk.

Still going strong: An Afghan worker holds cocoons collected from dried mulberry leaves in Zandajan district of Herat province. The once flourishing silk trade that it was so proud of has been threatened by cheaper foreign imports which threatened generations of silkmaking families. Supply routes and exports of silk were effectively cut off during the Afghan-Russian war of 1979-89, and the industry was further diminished under the Taliban, which refused women access to factory work and education. However, the Department of Agriculture has now offered the families of Herat a lifeline - by providing some 5,050 silkworm boxes to several districts to revive silk production in the region. Some 42,500 women and their families are involved in the project which aims to provide a means of subsistence and potentially lead the international market access for silk producers in the country.

Tabor and his wife, Elizabeth McCourt, better known as \\"Baby Doe\\". Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \\" _ \\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \\"grub\\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \\"grub\\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took 17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \\"Pittsburgh Mine,\\" made 1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his 17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for 117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding 35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew....

Since Dan lives in the Northern Hemisphere, he experiences more sunlight during the summer months of May, June, and July, with August still typically offering extended daylight hours due to the hemisphere's position and Earth's axial tilt. This is because the Northern Hemisphere is facing the Sun, resulting in the Sun being higher in the sky and an overall increase in solar flux during these months. In contrast, Bill lives in the Southern Hemisphere in Tasmania. During August, the Southern Hemisphere is in its winter season, and November, December, and January are the warmer months with more direct sunlight because that's when the hemisphere faces the Sun.

Q: Question: How many copies were sold of Stout's second novel that received critical acclaim? Passage 1:The Philadelphia Phillies–Florida Marlins game began at 7:13 p.m. on May 29, 2010, to a crowd of 25,086 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. The home plate umpire was Mike DiMuro, the first base umpire was Tim Welke, the second base umpire was Jim Reynolds, and the third base umpire was Bill Welke. Roy Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history, retiring all 27 batters, and allowing no hits, no runs, and no errors. Although he is known as a ground ball pitcher, he struck out 11, his most of the year and the most by a Phillies pitcher at that point in the season. The opposing pitcher, Josh Johnson, allowed seven hits, one walk, and an unearned run in seven innings. The unearned run came in the top of the third, when Chase Utley's line drive bounced off the glove of Florida center fielder Cameron Maybin, allowing Wilson Valdez to score from first. This was the deciding factor in the game, for Josh Johnson did not allow another run for the duration of the game. Passage 2:Vida Blue, Kent Mercker, Kevin Millwood, and Cole Hamels are the only pitchers to start both a complete game no-hitter and a combined no-hitter. Vida Blue no-hit the Minnesota Twins on September 21, 1970, while pitching for the Oakland Athletics. He combined with Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie Fingers to no-hit the California Angels on September 28, 1975. While with the Atlanta Braves in 1991, Mercker, Mark Wohlers and Alejandro Peña no-hit the San Diego Padres in the National League's first combined no-hitter. Mercker threw a complete game no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 8, 1994. In addition to the game above in which Millwood and the Seattle Mariners tied the record by using six pitchers in a no-hitter, Millwood previously threw a complete game no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on April 27, 2003, while with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both Mercker and Blue were All-Stars in the seasons of their combined no-hitters, and Blue also won the Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player Award during his career. Passage 3:Strout's first novel, Amy and Isabelle (1998) met with widespread critical acclaim, became a national bestseller, and was adapted into a movie starring Elisabeth Shue. Her second novel, Abide with Me (2006), received critical acclaim but ultimately failed to be recognized to the extent of her debut novel. Two years later, Strout wrote and published Olive Kitteridge (2008), to critical and commercial success grossing nearly 25 million with over one million copies sold as of May 2017. The novel won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The book was adapted into a multi Emmy Award-winning mini series and became a New York Times bestseller. Five years later, she published The Burgess Boys (2013), which became a national bestseller. My Name Is Lucy Barton (2016) was met with international acclaim and topped the New York Times bestseller list. Lucy Barton later became the main character in Strout's 2017 novel, Anything is Possible. A sequel to Olive Kitteridge, titled Olive, Again, was published in 2019.

The scene unfolded in the cozy, dimly-lit dining room of the Browley's home, where the scent of a delicious home-cooked meal still lingered in the air. Good friends had gathered, filling the space with laughter and conversation that made everyone feel as though they belonged. As Hanna disappeared through the door, her face flushed and apologetic, the rest of the group continued their discussions. Mrs. Browley, a kind and experienced mother of three, reached over and patted Chris's hand. \\"No need to worry, dear. It's perfectly normal. I remember my pregnancies, and I had to make a run for the washroom more times than I can count.\\" Chris smiled weakly in response, although his concern was still evident. His eyes followed the direction in which Hanna had left, his mind racing with silent prayers for her comfort and well-being. He knew, thanks to Mrs. Browley's reassurance, that this phase of pregnancy was relatively common among expectant mothers, but he couldn't help but worry. Mr. Browley chimed in, taking a swig from his beer before speaking. \\"Remember, Chris, she's a tough one. Pregnant or not, she'll get through this with flying colors. All you can do is be there for her and support her along the way.\\" \\"Yes, just as you've always been,\\" added Mrs. Robinson, another member of the group who had been friends with Chris and Hanna since their college days. Amy, the youngest in the room and recently engaged, listened intently to the conversation. She respected the others' opinions and cherished their advice, knowing that she would soon embark on her journey into motherhood as well. She wondered if she could handle pregnancy as gracefully as Hanna was attempting to do. As they carried on with their conversations, passing around food and drinks, everyone maintained a small, unspoken vigilance for Hanna, attentively listening for her return. The air was filled with sincerity and support, a strong testament to the bond shared among the friends. When Hanna finally re-emerged, her face still holding a tinge of red from embarrassment, the warm smiles and understanding glances that welcomed her back into the fold immediately put her at ease. She knew that she was in the company of people who genuinely cared about her and her family, and this thought brought her a sense of comfort. As the evening continued, the group grew even closer, sharing stories about their experiences and offering advice or a kind word when needed. The atmosphere enveloped them in a blanket of love and trust, reminding everyone just how important these friendships were in their lives. Afterward, when the guests had gone, and the last dish had been washed and put away, Chris found Hanna in their bedroom, lying down and resting her eyes. As he lay beside her, he whispered softly, \\"You did great tonight, and I am here for you always, just as our friends will be.\\" For Hanna, this reminder, though small, carried immense meaning. It was a reassurance that she was not alone in her journey, and no matter the challenges that may lie ahead, they would face them together, bolstered by the love and support of their friends. And with that thought warming her heart, Hanna could finally drift off to sleep, feeling deeply grateful and incredibly loved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. and a hint : Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Please answer this question : Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Answer:","completion":"Case A would have faster air flow above it than case B. In case A, the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing, where the shape of the wing causes the air to flow more quickly above the wing, resulting in lower air pressure. This difference in air pressure generates lift that allows the airplane to fly. In contrast, case B involves air flow like that of a race car spoiler. The shape of the spoiler causes the air to flow more slowly above it, resulting in greater air pressure. This increased air pressure pushes the car downward, providing better traction for the wheels on the track. So, comparing both cases A and B, case A exhibits faster air flow above it, while case B has slower air flow and increased air pressure above it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday Movie plot: In 1630 Russia, Princess Asa (Barbara Steele), a beautiful, dark-haired, young woman is condemned for practicing witchcraft. The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket. Leaving the driver to repair the damage, the pair decide to investigate an old ruined chapel nearby, where they discover the witch's coffin in the crypt below. Kruvejan is suddenly attacked by a large bat, and when he beats it to death in his cane, he accidentally smashes the stone cross position over the window. The fragments from the cross smash the glass, enabling Kruvejan to pull away the witch's mask. Her face is sunken and decayed, but is otherwise intact. Gorovek convinces his friend to leave before the driver becomes overly anxious, but unbeknownst to both, blood from a small cut on Kruvejans hand is already working to revive Asa.Outside the chapel, the two doctors are startled by Princess Katia (Barbara Steele in a dual role), the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani).

A: A:","completion":"The intermolecular structure of ice has spaces that are not present in liquid water. Ice has a unique and ordered arrangement of water molecules due to the hydrogen bonding among them. When water freezes and solidifies into ice, its molecules organize themselves into a hexagonal lattice structure. This structure creates open spaces within the ice crystal, which are not present in liquid water. In liquid water, the water molecules are in constant motion and form transient hydrogen bonds with one another. The molecules do not have a fixed arrangement, and they continuously break and reform hydrogen bonds. This constant motion and the lack of an ordered structure cause liquid water to have a denser molecular arrangement and fewer open spaces compared to ice. The presence of open spaces in ice is responsible for a number of unique properties that ice exhibits, such as its lower density compared to liquid water. It is also the reason why ice floats on water, as the open spaces make ice less dense. Moreover, these spaces within the hexagonal lattice structure influence other physical properties of ice, such as its thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and refractive index. Overall, the intermolecular structure of ice is characterized by a well-defined hexagonal lattice with open spaces, while liquid water has a more random and close-packed arrangement of molecules. These structural differences result in a variety of unique properties and behaviors exhibited by ice in comparison to liquid water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question Why is Manji content with sleeping for awhile now ? Answer:","completion":"Manji is content with sleeping for awhile now due to several reasons, primarily stemming from the recent acquisition of a bundle of gold coins. This newfound wealth has directly and indirectly influenced his state of mind and sense of security, allowing him to feel comfortable enough to take an extended period of rest. Here are a few key factors contributing to his contentment: 1. Financial stability: Obtaining a significant amount of gold coins has alleviated any pressing financial concerns for Manji. With these funds, he can afford essential needs such as food, shelter, and clothing without having to worry about running out of money. This financial stability provides a strong foundation for his peace of mind, as he no longer has to live hand-to-mouth or worry about where his next meal will come from. 2. Reduced stress: With his financial situation resolved, Manji has experienced a substantial decrease in stress levels. The constant pressure that comes with financial insecurity can be mentally and physically exhausting. But now that he has secured a sufficient amount of wealth, Manji can focus on other aspects of his life without being burdened by the persistent stress of monetary concerns. 3. Opportunity for self-care and recovery: Manji's statement, \\"I could sleep for a week,\\" suggests that he is in dire need of rest and recovery. Having acquired a source of financial security, Manji can now afford to take some time off, tend to his health, and recuperate from any physical or emotional exhaustion he may have experienced. In this period of respite, Manji can focus on self-care, restoring his energy levels, and improving his overall well-being. 4. Enhanced optimism and outlook on life: Manji's comment, \\"No cash problem now, for sure - things are lookin' up\\", illustrates an improved outlook on life due to the acquisition of gold coins. With greater financial security and reduced stress, Manji's optimism has grown. This positive outlook can have a tremendous impact on his mental health, allowing him to approach challenges and future endeavors with a more proactive and optimistic mindset. 5. Reflection of personal values and priorities: Manji's willingness to take possession of the gold coins and his subsequent contentment with sleeping for an extended period may indicate that he values financial stability over strict adherence to moral or societal norms. Rin's criticism of Manji's actions in acquiring the money highlights this potential deviation from accepted ethical behavior. Nevertheless, Manji appears to prioritize his own well-being and comfort above societal expectations, contributing further to his sense of contentment. In conclusion, Manji's contentment with sleeping for awhile now is a direct result of the security and relief brought about by his acquisition of gold coins. This financial windfall has enabled him to secure his basic needs, reduce stress, engage in self-care, and adopt a more optimistic outlook on life, ultimately allowing him to enjoy a period of well-deserved rest and rejuvenation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level.

Does it follow that \\"The fall of Pol Pot is encouraging.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does follow. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and justification: 1. Understand the Meaning: The first step is to understand what the user is trying to convey. In the given statement, we can understand that the user finds the \\"rejection\\" of Pol Pot heartening. Pol Pot was a political leader known for his autocratic rule and the severe human rights abuses that happened under it. Heartening refers to something providing encouragement or comfort. 2. Identify the Synonyms: In the statement \\"The fall of Pol Pot is encouraging,\\" the word \\"fall\\" corresponds with the \\"rejection\\" from the first sentence. Similarly, \\"encouraging\\" corresponds with \\"heartening.\\" Both pairs of words share similar meanings: \\"fall\\" and \\"rejection\\" are about losing power and \\"encouraging\\" and \\"heartening\\" denote positive moral support or upliftment. 3. Draw Inferences: The fall of a leader usually implies the end of their reign which is closely related to the term \\"rejection\\". Likewise, the terms \\"encouraging\\" and \\"heartening\\" suggest a sense of relief or a potential improvement, thereby generating a positive emotional response. 4. Conclude: Since both sentences convey a similar sentiment - the end of Pol Pot's rule providing a sense of positive feeling - it can be concluded that \\"The fall of Pol Pot is encouraging\\" follows from \\"The rejection of Pol Pot is heartening.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also...

As the television's constant drone slowly faded into the background, the Parrot's song took center stage in the room, transporting James into a realm of tranquility and harmony, where his anxieties and stress gradually dissipated like raindrops evaporating under a warm, golden sunlight. In that moment, the symphony of chirrups, whistles, and tweets emanating from the Parrot enchanted James, reminding him of the beautiful intricacies of nature and the power that simple, uninhibited joy can have in elevating one's spirit. As the Parrot continued to fill the space with its vibrant serenade, James found his thoughts drifting away from the trivial distractions of daily life, and instead focusing on the present moment – a moment he found himself increasingly grateful for. At the same time, the Parrot's song awakened in James a sense of connection to something greater than himself. It wasn't just a melodious soundtrack playing in the background, but rather a life force, sustaining and nourishing the very essence of his being. As the television's incessant chatter faded further into the distance, James found himself enveloped by a feeling of profound oneness with the world around him – the lush greenery of the trees outside his window, the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind, and, of course, the magnificent, awe-inspiring Parrot who had captured his heart with its transcendent song. With each note that the Parrot sang, James felt his connection to the world, and to himself, deepening; he realized that he was no longer merely a passive listener to the Parrot's song, but rather a participant in a cosmic dance, joining the Parrot and all of creation in a harmonious celebration of life. As the Parrot's melodies continued to ring through the air, every cell in James' body seemed to hum with energy and vibrate with the joy of being alive, his spirit soaring on the wings of the Parrot's song, towards the sun-drenched horizon that lay just beyond the limits of his imagination. Ultimately, James' decision to lower the volume of the television opened up a world of infinite possibility and boundless beauty, as he discovered the innate power that lay hidden in the Parrot's song. In doing so, he not only deepened his appreciation for the wonders of nature, but also connected to a wellspring of inner peace, tranquility, and self-awareness that would remain with him long after the final notes of the song had disappeared into the ether. And as the television continued to flicker silently in the background, the radiant echoes of the Parrot's song enveloped James in a cocoon of pure, unadulterated joy that would forever linger in the depths of his soul."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees.

We can combine these terms by adding their coefficients: 0 = (674 - 1318)n + 12236 0 = -644n + 12236 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'n'. To isolate 'n', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. To achieve this, we can first subtract 12236 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 12236 = -644n + 12236 - 12236 -12236 = -644n Now, we need to get rid of the coefficient -644. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -644: -12236 / -644 = (-644n) / -644 19 = n So, the solution to the equation 0 = 674n - 1318n + 12236 is n = 19."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Based on the provided information that cells that divide uncontrollably may form a tumor or an abnormal mass of cells, and that cancer begins when a cell starts dividing uncontrollably, the best answer from the given choices would be: cancer. However, it is essential to understand that the term \\"cancer\\" encompasses a wide range of diseases that involve uncontrolled cell growth. While cancer is indeed a possible cause of tumor formation, it is worth discussing the other factors that may contribute to the development of tumors. 1. Cancer: As mentioned above, uncontrolled cell division leading to the growth of abnormal cells forms tumors. Cancerous (malignant) tumors can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream and lymphatic system. 2. Parasites: Some parasites are known to cause tumor formation in some cases. For example, the parasitic flatworms, Schistosoma species, can cause bladder cancer in infected individuals. 3. Pesticides: Long-term exposure to certain harmful chemicals, including pesticides, has been linked to an increased risk of developing various types of cancer, including tumors. Many pesticides are known carcinogens, promoting the uncontrolled growth of cells. 4. Radiation: Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as the radiation emitted by x-rays, radon, and nuclear materials, increases the risk of developing cancer. This form of radiation can cause damage to cellular DNA, leading to mutations that may result in tumor formation. 5. Genetic predisposition: Inherited genetic mutations can increase an individual's risk of developing tumors. For instance, mutated genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. It is crucial to realize that multiple factors often contribute to the development of tumors – environmental factors, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle choices, to name a few. Although cancer is the best answer among the given choices, it is vital to consider all potential contributing factors when studying tumor formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Answer the following question: Article: Bicycle sharing systems are also known as yellow bicycle programs, white bicycle programs, public bikes, or free bikes. They are increasingly popular in Europe now. Paris has the world's largest urban cycle rental system. This is a bike rental station in Paris. The worker is showing how to use a new self-service bike. They say that Paris will become \\"a green capital of bikes\\" and they plan to park 20,000 bicycles at 1,600 stations. Paris created this plan to improve the city traffic environment and reduce the waste gas displacement . At a rental station, you only have to put your credit card into the machine to rent a bike. It provides French, German, English and Chinese services. If you ride the bike for only 30 minutes to relax, you needn't pay for it. A two-hour bike rent only costs you 4 euros. These stations work for 24 hours every day, so a bike is rented for 10 to 14 times a day. In this way there are 200,000 people using bikes a day, In the past few years, Paris has encouraged its people to ride bikes, but something unhappy has happened now and then. Some people break the traffic rules during rush hours. Some park their bikes everywhere. So how to park bikes is a problem that Paris will face.

Purchase a Vittsjo laptop desk from IKEA and assemble it according to the instructions, then turn the desk onto its side. Screw in industrial casters on the bottom of the feet so that the desk will roll when it is stood upright. Option A is the better solution for transforming a Vittsjo laptop desk into a bar cart. By assembling the desk according to the instructions and turning it onto its side, you can create a suitable foundation for a bar cart. Adding industrial casters to the bottom of the feet allows for easy movement and supports the weight of the items on the bar cart. Option B is incorrect because screwing the casters on the top of the desk will not be functional when the desk is stood upright.

A 22-year-old gunman killed six people in an Isla Vista rampage that began with a 140-page manifesto and an apartment stabbing and ended with a crashed BMW and an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. \\"It all has to come to this,\\" Elliot Rodger stated during a nearly seven-minute \\"Retribution\\" video uploaded to YouTube on May 23. He later added: \\"After I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I'll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there.\\" Rodger, who died of a gunshot wound in the BMW, is the son of Hunger Games second unit director Peter Rodger. He had been a student who attended Santa Barbara City College classes sporadically since 2011. REPORT: Santa Barbara Shooting Suspect's Parents Tried to Find Him During Killing Spree The Santa Barbara sheriff's office had made contact with Rodger three times prior to the mass shooting, including an April 30 incident where deputies followed up on a request from a family member who asked that police check on his welfare. \\"The deputies contacted the suspect, at the time found him to be polite and courteous, he downplayed the concerns for his welfare and the deputies cleared the call,” stated Sheriff Bill Brown at a Saturday evening press conference carried live on local stations and cable broadcasters. The first three victims in the later rampage were \\"stabbed repeatedly with sharp objects\\" in Rodger's apartment, the next two were shot outside the Alpha Phi sorority and the last victim was killed at a local deli, the sheriff stated. Thirteen people were injured during the shootings, including multiple bicyclists that authorities said were hit with Rodger's vehicle. Rodger was armed with multiple handguns, all legally purchased. Three 9-mm semi-automatic handguns were found in his vehicle. \\"It would appear as though he took his own life,\\" Sheriff Brown said. Peter Rodger's attorney, Alan Shifman, earlier confirmed by phone to The Hollywood Reporter that the family had contacted police about Elliot several weeks prior to the shooting. Shifman also said that the college student had been seeing a social worker and therapists recently. The Associated Press earlier quoted Shifman saying that police were contacted after YouTube clips were uploaded \\"regarding suicide and the killing of people.\\" The 140-page manifesto is titled \\"My Twisted World The Story of Elliot Rodger.\\" The shooting on Friday occurred in 10 different crime scene areas in the college town located near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Late Saturday, the Santa Barbara sheriff's office issued an updated statement piecing together how the deadly incident ended. Black BMW shown at the scene of a drive-by shooting. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \\"Witnesses report he drove at a high rate of speed and struck another bicyclist. This victim was thrown onto the hood of Rodger’s car and caved in the windshield,\\" read the updated statement. \\"The suspect’s vehicle then collided with several parked cars and came to a stop. Responding deputies immediately removed Rodger from the car and handcuffed him. They discovered Rodger was dead with an apparent gunshot wound to the head.\\" The license plate of the crashed vehicle matches the plate of a BMW seen in a photo on Elliot Rodger's Facebook page that shows the student sitting in the driver's seat of the car with sunglasses on. The shooting, described by the sheriff's office as \\"a premeditated mass murder,\\" followed a video titled \\"Elliot Rodger's Retribution.\\" In the clip, Elliot Rodger describes a scenario in which he takes \\"revenge\\" by exacting violence on the \\"streets of Isla Vista.\\" \\"This is my last video,\\" Elliot Rodger said in the clip, which appears to be filmed in the front seat of his BMW. \\"Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity.\\" A screenshot of a video titled \\"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\\" that was uploaded to YouTube (since taken down). In the video clip, Elliot Rodger then lists a number of perceived injustices related to his college experience. \\"I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you, you'll finally see that I'm, in truth, the superior one, the true alpha male,\\" he said in the clip. \\"After I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I'll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there.\\" A YouTube channel page for Elliot Rodger shows numerous videos with titles like \\"Being lonely on Spring Break sucks\\" and \\"Why do girls hate me so much?\\" along with clips headlined \\"My morning drive to school\\" that show the student alone and driving a BMW sedan on Santa Barbara area roads. \\"I can't enjoy life in this world anymore,\\" Rodger said in a May 23 YouTube video that was titled \\"Elliot Rodger, Lonely Vlog, Life is so unfair.\\" In addition to his work on The Hunger Games, Elliot Rodger's father, Peter, had directed Oh My God, a 2009 documentary that explored theological questions. For the 2012 Lionsgate tentpole, the director had helped create \\"the propaganda film for the fictional 'Capitol' in the story,\\" according to the filmmaker's website. In the manifesto, Elliot Rodger makes reference to attending The Hunger Games premiere in Los Angeles with his father. While Rodger had been a student at Santa Barbara City College, he wasn't currently enrolled, the school said on Saturday. He \\"had registered at SBCC at various times during the last three years but had either stopped attending or withdrew from all courses,\\" the SBCC statement read. \\"Before that, in 2011, he completed three courses.\\" Henry T. Yang, the chancellor for the University of California, Santa Barbara, located nearby Isla Vista, issued a Saturday statement mourning the victims of the shooting. \\"We grieve for the precious lives lost, and we share in the heartbreak of their families, friends, and classmates,\\" Yang wrote. By late Sunday the sheriff's office had released the names of all six shooting victims: Katherine Breann Cooper, 22; Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19; Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20; Cheng Yuan Hong, 20; George Chen, 19; Weihan Wang, 20. All six victims, the last three of whose names were released late Sunday, were all UCSB students, the sheriff's office said. The final three who were named were found with multiple stab wounds in Rodger's apartment. Hong and Chen were listed on the lease for the apartment as tenants, along with Rodger, the sheriff's office said, indicating they were his roommates. The sheriff's office is still trying to determine whether Wang was also a roommate or was visiting the apartment. \\"Our son Christopher Martinez and six others are dead. Our family has a message for every parent out there: you don't think it will happen to your child until it does,\\" said Richard Martinez, the father of a 20-year-old shooting victim, in a press conference aired on CNN. On Saturday night, thousands of people reportedly attended a candlelight vigil on the UCSB campus. Hilary Lewis contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A long time ago, there was a sad and angry 22-year-old named Elliot Rodger. His dad, Peter Rodger, helped make movies like the Hunger Games. Elliot felt very lonely and upset because he thought people didn't like him and girls didn't want to be friends with him. One day, he decided to do a very bad thing. He wrote a long story about his feelings and made a video where he said he would hurt many people. Elliot then went on a rampage, which means he hurt many people on purpose, near the UC Santa Barbara campus in a place called Isla Vista. He used a car and guns. Elliot did something very wrong and in the end, 6 people lost their lives and 7 others got hurt. After doing all these bad things, Elliot also lost his life. People in the town and college were very sad and came together to remember the ones who were hurt and lost. Everyone learned that it's important to pay attention to how people feel and to help them if they are feeling lonely or upset to prevent such bad things from happening."},{"prompt":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim.

A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - Ladakh (\\"land of high passes\\") (Ladakhi: \\"la'dwags\\"; ) is a region in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that currently extends from the Kunlun mountain range to the main Great Himalayas to the south, inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent. It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Jammu and Kashmir and its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks.

The answer is: a). negative. The sentence in the movie review states that the reviewer had not walked out on a movie in 13 months and 295 preview screenings, which seems to imply that they have a high tolerance for movies and typically give them a chance. The fact that they decided to walk out on this particular movie suggests that it did not meet their expectations or they found it so unenjoyable that they could not endure watching the entire film. Walking out on a movie is generally seen as a strong indicator of a negative response towards the film. It is important to note that the reviewer does not explicitly mention anything positive about the movie, and the emphasis on the long streak and high number of screenings prior to this movie further reinforces their disappointment. Had the movie been seen positively, the reviewer would have likely continued their streak without the need to walk out. Additionally, the focus on breaking this streak due to the current movie highlights how bad it was to the reviewer. In conclusion, walking out on the movie after not doing so for such a significant period suggests a substantial negative reaction from the reviewer towards the film. The answer to the question is a) negative, as it demonstrates disapproval and dissatisfaction with the movie experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a premise: \\"A man stands in the midst of bike wheels.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A bike technician is looking for a wheel to replace on a broken bike.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise, \\"A man stands in the midst of bike wheels,\\" provides a scene in which a man is surrounded by bike wheels. However, it does not give us enough information to determine whether the hypothesis, \\"A bike technician is looking for a wheel to replace on a broken bike,\\" is true or not. There are several possible scenarios that could occur in this context, and while the hypothesis is one of them, it is not the only one. To analyze further, let's break down the information provided by the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Premise: The man is surrounded by bike wheels. 2. Hypothesis: The man is a bike technician, and he is trying to find a suitable replacement wheel for a broken bike. It's important to note that while the premise gives us insight into what is happening in the scene (a man is among bike wheels), it does not provide any information about the man's occupation, intentions, or motivation (i.e., whether he is a bike technician or whether he is looking for a wheel to replace on a broken bike). We can come up with alternative scenarios that would also fit the premise without supporting the hypothesis. For example, the man could be: 1. An artist who is creating an art installation using bike wheels. 2. A curious passerby who has wandered into a bike shop or a recycling center with various bike parts. 3. A person clearing out a storage room containing old bike parts. 4. A bike enthusiast who is admiring a collection of vintage or rare bike wheels. While the hypothesis is certainly a plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise, there is not enough information in the premise alone to conclude that the hypothesis is true or false. We would need more context, such as information about the man's profession, his actions, or his environment, to adequately determine the accuracy of the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true, as there are various other scenarios compatible with the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, there are two ways to help make those spots go away: 1. Get a special medicine called a vaccine. This is like a superhero shield that protects your body from the chickenpox. If you get this vaccine, you may not get chickenpox at all or you might get just a very mild case of it.

Answer:","completion":"Ratchet is one of the two main characters from the popular video game series Ratchet & Clank, which was first released in 2002 by the American company Insomniac Games. He is a Lombax, a fictional species in the universe of the game, known for their intelligence and mechanic abilities. Ratchet's species distinguishes him as he is portrayed to be the last of his kind in the main series, giving him a more unique and compelling character background. Ratchet is depicted as being anthropomorphic, meaning he has human-like characteristics, even though he is from a different species. He is unique with a tanned fur cover, an upright posture and humanoid form, and he possesses heights of dexterity allowing him to use a wide range of weapons and equipment. Ratchet is popular for his trademark arsenal, which includes a wrench used for both melee combat and manipulating the environment, as well as a diverse assortment of upgradeable firearms. Despite his powerful weapons, Ratchet's personality is marked more by his wit, intelligence, and determination. He displays exceptional skills as a mechanic, which play a crucial role in the game as it involves solving puzzles and building his own weapons. He is quick to dive headfirst into danger driven by a desire to explore, and his bravery interspersed with a bit of recklessness make him a formidable character in the game. In terms of characterization, he was initially depicted as young and somewhat immature but possessing a strong sense of heroism and justice. As the series developed, Ratchet matured emotionally, showing depth in his understanding of right and wrong, and willingness to take responsibility for his actions. Clank, Ratchet's sidekick and best friend, is also a critical part of Ratchet's character. Clank is a small sentient robot who often acts as Ratchet's conscience and helps him to make morally right decisions. Their chemistry throughout the game series forms a significant part of their appeal. In terms of gameplay, playing as Ratchet offers players the opportunity to engage in combats, puzzle-solving, and exploration of diverse, colorful game worlds. Ratchet's abilities improve as you progress through the levels, making the gameplay more involving and enjoyable. In addition to the games, Ratchet & Clank have also starred in a feature film adaption in 2016 and a short-lived comic book series. In all these media, Ratchet is consistently portrayed as a lovable, brave Lombax with a strong sense of adventure and justice, making him a well-rounded and endearing character."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

Question: Where does Hondo get into a fight with a stranger? Title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: If you are moving to France, you’ll want to spend some time learning at least a little bit of the French language. You’ll need to be able to talk to people when you rent a property, find a job, order food in a restaurant, and in almost every other aspect of your life in France. Learning the language is crucial. Try hiring a French tutor, taking a class at a university, using an online program like Rosetta Stone, or a fun learning app like Duolingo. If you move to a major metropolitan area like Paris, it is likely that you will encounter people who speak English quite regularly. However, if you are moving to a more rural area, you will need to speak French to get by in your day-to-day life. The location you move to in France may depend on your job, or it may be a little more open to selection for you. If you can choose, think about where you would like to go to in France. If you want to live in a city with more job opportunities and that may be easier for a foreigner to integrate, consider Paris, Toulouse, or Lyon. If you want a more quaint French countryside experience, consider moving to a more rural location with a smaller population. You may wish to stay in furnished housing, or if you are shipping some items you may prefer to get an unfurnished flat. There are many options for places to live in France, so consider which one will be the best for you. The Internet can be a good source of accommodations, especially sites that cater to those emigrating to France. Try searching on sites like SeLoger, PAP, or Lodgis. If you want to find a traditional apartment in France, be aware that there are some things to consider. For example, if you don’t earn an income that is three times the rent, you will be asked to provide a guarantor (like a co-signer on a loan) who will be legally responsible to pay for you if you aren’t able to pay your rent. This person must be someone who earns income in France – so it can’t be your parents back in your home country – which can cause problems for people initially moving to a new country. If you are planning on living in France for a shorter period of time (a matter of months, rather than years), you may want to consider renting a place on a website like AirBnb. This option might be a bit more expensive than obtaining a traditional apartment, but it will save you the hassle of searching for an apartment in person when you arrive in France, securing a guarantor, signing up for renter’s insurance, activating utilities in your home, furnishing your apartment, etc. Search for flights on the Internet and try to find the best deal. Spend some time looking and consider all of your options. You could also go through a travel agent if you are not comfortable booking the flight yourself. When booking your flight, consider things like layovers and travel time. If you are checking a bunch of bags, the more layovers you have the more likely it is that all of your bags won’t arrive with you. If you are bringing a pet with you on the aeroplane, you may want to pay a little extra for a direct flight to limit your travel time. Keep in mind that return flights are almost always less expensive than one-way flights. So, even if you don’t plan to return to your country of origin, you might want to consider purchasing a return ticket anyway. Ship valuables that you cannot take with you on the plane ahead to France. There are many shipping services you can utilize, but be aware of French governmental restrictions on shipping personal items. These restrictions may vary, but as of 2010 include: Firearms, ammunition, meat, dairy products, plants, narcotics, psychotropic substances, pets, medicine, precious metals, cash, counterfeit items, and wild animals. If you want to bring your family pets with you to France, you will have to make sure your pet’s vaccinations (especially rabies) are up to date, have your vet complete a health clearance travel form (and possibly get this form stamped by your country’s import/export authority), and ensure that your pet has been microchipped. France may require additional measures to be taken for pets being imported from certain countries. Before shipping any items to France, check with the French Consulate to be sure that you have the updated shipping restrictions. What is a summary?","completion":"Moving to France involves several crucial steps. First, learning the French language is essential for communicating in day-to-day life, through tutors, classes, or online programs like Rosetta Stone or Duolingo. Next, consider your preferred location in France based on job opportunities and lifestyle preferences. When searching for accommodation, make use of websites like SeLoger, PAP, or Lodgis, and be prepared to provide a guarantor if your income is not three times the rent. Short-term stays can consider AirBnb as an alternative. When booking flights, evaluate travel time, layovers, and whether a return ticket is more cost-effective.

Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the earth core cools happens, how will it affect less magma cools to form new crust. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The described perturbation hypothesis involves the Earth's core cooling down, which would affect the formation of magma and, in turn, the formation of new crust. To fully understand the potential effects of this hypothesis, it is crucial to explore the details of the process and both the direct and indirect effects it may have on crust formation and the overall geological landscape. Firstly, let's briefly review the process of magma formation and how it leads to the creation of new crust: 1. Magma generation: Magma is formed through the partial melting of the Earth's mantle, triggered by factors such as changes in pressure or the introduction of volatiles. As the mantle melts, magma rises due to its lower density compared to the surrounding material. 2. Plate movement and stress: The Earth's lithosphere, which consists of the crust and upper mantle, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are in constant motion, driven by forces generated by the circulation of molten material in the Earth's mantle. As plates interact, they create stress and cracks in the Earth's crust. 3. Magma ascent: Magma takes advantage of these cracks and weak points to ascend through the Earth's crust. 4. Volcanic eruption: When the pressure in the magma chamber overcomes the overlying rock strength, it results in the explosive release of magma, ash, and gases, forming a volcanic eruption. 5. Lava cooling and crust formation: The lava produced during the eruption cools and solidifies, creating new crust material. This process happens repeatedly over time, eventually leading to the formation of volcanic landforms. Now, let's consider the proposed perturbation hypothesis and its effects on this process: Should the Earth's core cool down significantly, it could lead to a reduced heat flow from the core to the mantle. This, in turn, would impact the mantle's temperature and its ability to generate magma. Fewer magma sources would result in less magma ascending through the cracks in the Earth's crust, thereby leading to fewer volcanic eruptions. Direct effects of this perturbation on the process: 1. Magma production: A cooler core would potentially decrease magma production, leading to a decline in volcanic activity. This would affect the generation of new crust material, slowing down the process. 2. Tectonic plate movement: A cooler core may also indirectly influence the dynamics of tectonic plate movement. The reduction in heat from the core might weaken the mantle convection, altering the forces that drive plate motion. Indirect effects of this perturbation on the process: 1. Geological consequences: A reduction in volcanic activity could lead to changes in a region's topography, affecting landscapes and ecosystems. Moreover, decreased volcanic activity might influence the distribution of mineral resources, as many valuable minerals are associated with volcanic and hydrothermal processes. 2. Climate implications: Volcanic eruptions release gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, which can have an impact on climate. A reduction in volcanic activity may cause a decline in the release of such gases and aerosols, potentially affecting global climate patterns. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of the Earth's core cooling would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the process of magma production and new crust formation. As the core cools, the overall generation of magma could decline, leading to fewer volcanic eruptions, slower crust formation, and various implications to the Earth's geological and climate systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: Where can one find multiple closets? Options: - hotel - apartment building - bedroom - school - house The answer is \\"house\\" because A:","completion":"A house is the most likely place where one can find multiple closets for several reasons, as compared to the other options provided: 1. Residential purpose: A house is primarily designed as a dwelling unit for families or individuals, providing ample space for living, bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and storage. This calls for the need to have multiple closets to meet the storage needs of the people residing in the house. Each bedroom typically has at least one closet, in addition to various other closets scattered throughout the house for storing items like coats, linens, and cleaning supplies. 2. Customization and design variety: Unlike apartments, which often have more standardized floor plans and design layouts, houses can be customized based on the homeowner's preferences. This allows for more creative placement and allocation of storage spaces, resulting in the likelihood of multiple closets being integrated into the house's design. The homeowner may opt for walk-in closets, built-in closets, or separate closet rooms depending on their storage requirements and available space. 3. Size and capacity: In general, houses possess more overall square footage as compared to apartments and hotel rooms, allowing for a larger number of closets to be fit comfortably into the space. With more rooms comes the need for more storage spaces, making the probability of finding multiple closets in a house greater than that in other options. 4. Family needs: Houses are usually designed to accommodate families, which results in more bedrooms and spaces tailored to suit various age groups and family dynamics. A family would have more belongings, clothes, and accessories, thus requiring more storage spaces such as closets to keep everything neatly organized. 5. Long-term residency: Unlike hotels, which are temporary accommodation solutions, and schools, which serve educational purposes, houses are purchased or rented for long-term stays. As people spend more time in a house, they accumulate more belongings and require more storage spaces. Therefore, having multiple closets is an essential and common aspect of a house. Comparing this to the other options: - Hotels typically provide only one closet within a room, as it caters to short-term guests who may not require extensive storage space for their belongings. Moreover, hotels are designed for temporary stays and emphasize convenience and ease rather than storage capacity. - Apartment buildings might contain multiple apartments, each with a few closets, but individual apartments usually have fewer closets than a house due to limited space and standardized designs. - A bedroom might have one or two closets, but it is just a single room within a dwelling unit. The question is asking about where one can find multiple closets, and it is more reasonable to assume that a house, which would contain multiple bedrooms and living spaces, would have multiple closets. - Schools primarily cater to educational and social needs. While they might have some storage spaces like lockers or supply closets, their main purpose is not residential, and thus, they are less likely to have multiple closets designed for personal use. Therefore, considering all of the factors and comparisons, the answer is \\"house,\\" as it provides the most suitable environment to find multiple closets due to its residential purpose, design variety, size, family accommodation, and long-term residency characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: When rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings didn't work for Eddie Freas, he sought another way to kick his 20-year drug and alcohol addiction. Eddie Freas fights drug addiction by putting all his energy into training for triathlons. He swam 2.4 miles. He biked 112 miles. He ran 26.2 miles. The Pennsville, New Jersey, resident found relief in triathlons. \\"I feel better when I'm working out,\\" said Freas, 33. \\"It does wonders for the mind. The reason I started running -- it was a switch that went off in my head. I started feeling positive and feeling great about myself.\\" Freas spent his youth in pursuit of drugs. At the age of 13, he snuck bottles of Amaretto and rum from his mother's liquor cabinet. He also developed a taste for marijuana and cocaine. By his senior year of high school, Freas was kicked off the wrestling and football teams after failing a drug test. Then in 2007, after a three-day binge, \\"I came home and was crying,\\" Freas said. \\"I was so depressed. I turned on the TV.\\" The set was tuned to ESPN, which was airing a story about a former drug addict who competed in triathlons. The program's subject was Todd Crandell, who had lost a college hockey scholarship because of a drug addiction. After 13 years of using drugs, Crandell started competing in Ironman races and championed finding positive ways to fight addiction through his program called Racing for Recovery. \\"Having an athletic background, I was drawn to getting back in shape,\\" Crandell said. \\"It makes you turn intellectually and spiritually fit. Exercise is essential. It decreases addiction, depression and you use it as part of the recovery.\\" Freas was entranced by the parallels. \\"His whole story seemed like mine,\\" Freas said. \\"That's why it hit me so much. It was my story but it happened to somebody else. I knew I had to get back into fitness.\\" He took a bus to Racing for Recovery's office in Sylvania, Ohio. There, Freas said he learned to \\"stay clean and use other things -- fitness, instead of drugs.\\" On his first day, Freas pushed himself to run 10 miles. \\"It killed me,\\" Freas said. \\"I was just motivated. I was sore for a week and I gradually got into it. As soon as I started including fitness into my everyday lifestyle, it made it so much easier. It kept me busy and because of the physical fitness, it was making me feel better about myself.\\" He pushed himself to run farther and raced in his first Ironman competition in 2008. \\"It's different when you use drugs, you temporarily feel good and afterwards, you feel like doing more drugs,\\" Freas said. \\"When you go for a long run and do physical fitness, you feel good doing it.\\" Research in animals and humans show that exercise can be a mild antidepressant. \\"It isn't a huge surprise when you consider many positive effects exercise can have with regards to the brain chemistry: dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, epinephrine -- these are all associated with mood altering effects,\\" said Dr. Cedric Bryant, the chief science officer for the American Council on Exercise. \\"If they're able to get this natural high, through a natural endeavor such as exercise, it allows them to replace the means to achieve that high with a more positive approach.\\" One study showed that women trying to quit smoking were more successful when they exercised. And the National Institute on Drug Abuse held a conference last year to explore the possible role of physical activity in substance abuse prevention. \\"The thought centers around the release of mood-altering brain chemical, mainly endorphins,\\" Bryant said. \\"It gives you euphoria or what you call 'runner's high.' \\" Crandell said some people who battle drug addiction \\"want something more than sitting in support groups filled with smoke, complaining about drinking.\\" \\"I've had some of my naysayers from other programs who say you've taken one addiction and replaced it for another,\\" Crandell said. \\"I've taken addiction and put into a new focus that includes exercise. Exercise for me is essential to my recovery and well-being.\\" The purpose of Racing for Recovery is not to turn everyone into an athlete, but to focus on positive pursuits in a person's life. \\"Whatever you lost during your addiction, that should be your Ironman, not just running,\\" Crandell said. \\"If your goal is to become a teacher, let that be your Ironman.\\" After Freas spent six months in Ohio, he returned to his hometown. \\"I didn't want to come back home, because this was where I did all the dirt, all the partying and stuff,\\" Freas said. \\"As time went on, I had to come back here. My life is turned around. I got to help people in my hometown.\\" Back in New Jersey, Freas helped train Dustin Deckard, 19, a former high school star wrestler, who is recovering from a four-year heroin addiction. Deckard wanted to get clean after a near-fatal overdose. \\"I have to be clean the rest of my life,\\" Deckard said. \\"Sometimes that overwhelms me. I just feel that sometimes it's not fair that other people can go out and have fun and drink and do whatever at a party. But me -- if I do anything -- it's off. I can't stop. I definitely have troubles with that.\\" Freas and Deckard have developed a brotherhood. \\"I know how he was feeling, being down, not wanting to use drugs,\\" Deckard said. \\"I just relate to him in every way. We both used. He's also into sports and into wrestling like I was. That's what's cool.\\" This Sunday, Freas and Deckard head to Racing for Recovery's half triathlon at Monroe, Michigan where the teen will race for the first time. Highlights:","completion":"1. Eddie Freas, a former drug and alcohol addict, turned to training for triathlons as a way to overcome his addiction after rehab and AA meetings failed to help. 2.

He is currently special assistant to the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. He had the winning hit in the 1992 World Series with the Blue Jays over the Atlanta Braves. After the 1992 season, Winfield was granted free agency and signed with his hometown Minnesota Twins, where he continued to perform at a high level of play despite advancing age. He batted .271 with 21 home runs, appearing in 143 games for the 1993 Twins, mostly as their designated hitter. On September 16, 1993, at age 41, he collected his 3,000th career hit with a single off Oakland Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley. During the 1994 baseball strike, which began on August 12, Winfield was traded to the Cleveland Indians at the trade waiver deadline on August 31 for a player to be named later. The 1994 season had been halted two weeks earlier (it was eventually canceled a month later on September 14), so Winfield did not get to play for the Indians that year and no player was ever named in exchange. To settle the trade, Cleveland and Minnesota executives went to dinner, with the Indians picking up the tab. This makes Winfield the only player in major league history to be \\"traded\\" for a dinner (though official sources list the transaction as Winfield having been sold by the Minnesota Twins to the Cleveland Indians). Winfield, who was now the oldest MLB player, was again granted free agency in October but re-signed with the Indians as spring training began in April 1995. A rotator cuff injury kept him on the disabled list for most of the season; thus he played in only 46 games and hit .191 for Cleveland's first pennant winner in 41 years. He did not participate in the Indians' postseason. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How was he traded for a dinner?","completion":"David Winfield was traded for a dinner when, during the 1994 baseball strike, he was traded from the Minnesota Twins to the Cleveland Indians.

They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Oligocene is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present (to ). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"oligos\\", few) and (\\"kainos\\", new), and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs. The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period. The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene. Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands, and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt. - Analectis pala is an extinct lamprid of the Family Turkmenidae . Its fossils are found from Late Oligocene strata from what is now Turkmenistan . Analectis , as with the other members of Turkmenidae , was a close relative of the opahs . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Turkmenistan (or ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Opahs (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish (not to be confused with Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: \\"Lampris\\" (from the Greek \\"lamprid-\\", \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus \\"Lampris\\" and the other in the monotypic \\"Megalampris\\", are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'taxon rank'. Answer:","completion":"The subject entity in this case is the family Turkmenidae, and the object entity is the taxon rank of 'family'. Turkmenidae is an extinct family of lamprids from the Paleogene of Turkmenistan. They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs (family Lampridae). The taxon rank of 'family' is a classification in biological taxonomy, used to categorize a group of related species, in this case, the Turkmenidae and its relation to other lamprids. Taxonomy is the system and procedure of classification of organisms based on their evolutionary relationships and natural characteristics.

Garcia appeared in his first concert at the age of nine , and since then he performed alone or with his aunt and uncle in all parts of France . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these sentences convey the same overall meaning despite having slight structural differences. Both sentences provide the information that Garcia began his concert appearances at the age of nine and has performed either solo or alongside his aunt and uncle in various locations throughout France. Here is a further breakdown of the two sentences: 1. \\"At the age of nine, he appeared in his first concert and since then he joined alone or with his aunt and his uncle in all parts of France.\\" The first sentence begins by mentioning the age at which Garcia started participating in concerts. It then proceeds to explain how he continued his performances, either as a solo act or accompanied by his aunt and uncle, touring various regions of France. 2. \\"Garcia appeared in his first concert at the age of nine, and since then he performed alone or with his aunt and uncle in all parts of France.\\" In the second sentence, the structure is modified slightly, yet it still covers the same essential information. This sentence starts by mentioning Garcia's name, followed by his first appearance in a concert at the age of nine. It maintains the same narrative about his later performances and their collaborative nature with his family members. To conclude, both sentences effectively communicate the same key details about Garcia's first concert appearance and the trajectory of his performances in France, albeit with minor differences in their structure and syntax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

From the given options, \\"dirt\\" is indeed a correct choice as it provides the necessary nutrients and support for the apple tree to grow. Additionally, \\"seeds\\" are also a correct choice, as they contain the genetic material of the apple tree and initiate the growth process when planted in suitable conditions. Although \\"South Africa\\" and \\"park\\" can have suitable environments for apple trees to grow, they are not universally necessary conditions. \\"Paradise\\" is an abstract concept and not directly related to the growth of apple trees."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -25*f + 75*f = -40*f + 1530 for f.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step, like a puzzle. We have this equation: -25*f + 75*f = -40*f + 1530 First, let’s look at the left side of the equation (before the equal sign). We see two \\"f\\" terms there: -25*f and 75*f. We can add these two terms together. -25*f + 75*f = 50*f (It's like if you had -25 apples and then got 75 apples, you'd have 50 apples.) Now the equation looks like this: 50*f = -40*f + 1530 Next, we want to gather all the \\"f\\" terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -40*f from the right side to the left side. To do this, we can add 40*f to both sides of the equation. 50*f + 40*f = -40*f + 40*f + 1530 90*f = 1530 (Now, we have all the \\"f\\" terms on the left side.) Now we need to \\"isolate\\" \\"f\\" by getting it all alone on one side of the equation. Since we have 90 times \\"f\\" (90*f), we'll divide both sides of the equation by 90. 90*f / 90 = 1530 / 90 f = 1530 / 90 Now, we just need to solve for the value of \\"f\\". 1530 divided by 90 equals 17. So, f = 17. That means the solution to the math problem is f = 17! Good job solving the puzzle!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Hello little friend! Let's break it down. A premise is like a starting idea or fact. In this case, the idea is: \\"I left the cockpit, venturing outside.\\" A hypothesis is like a guess we make. In this case, the guess is: \\"I sat down in the cockpit and waited.\\" Now, you're wondering if the starting idea (premise) being true means the guess (hypothesis) is also true, right? Well, the first idea talks about leaving the cockpit and going outside. The second idea talks about sitting in the cockpit and waiting. They are like two different stories because they talk about two different things happening. So, no, even if the premise (starting idea) is true, it does not mean the hypothesis (guess) is true.

When moving to America, Michael got his citizenship before Nick because pick from the following. (A). Michael was better at civics.; (B). Nick was better at civics.;","completion":"When moving to America, Michael got his citizenship before Nick because (A) Michael was better at civics. The process of obtaining American citizenship involves not only the completion of paperwork and meeting the residency requirements but also passing the civics test as part of the naturalization interview. Being better at civics allowed Michael to have a smoother journey through the naturalization process compared to Nick. As an important aspect of American society and government structure, civics encompass knowledge about the U.S. Constitution, historical events, and government functions. Michael's stronger grasp of civics allowed him to understand the values, principles, and rights and responsibilities associated with becoming an American citizen. This understanding and proficiency also enabled Michael to better prepare for the necessary exams and interviews required by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Although Nick, on the other hand, was described as being better at civics in option (B), the chosen answer implies that Michael had the advantage. This indicates that it was Michael's superior civics knowledge that made a difference in the timeline of their respective journeys to U.S. citizenship. Despite Nick's civics abilities, there might have been other factors such as lack of adequate preparation, language barriers, or individual circumstances that contributed to the delay in obtaining his citizenship. Moreover, the naturalization process tests not only the applicants' civics knowledge but also their ability to communicate effectively in English. Michael's better civics knowledge may have directly contributed to his overall language proficiency and ability to understand and convey complex ideas related to the American government and history. By being better at civics, Michael had a solid foundation for successfully completing the various stages of the citizenship process. He was not only able to pass the required test but also likely impressed the immigration officers with his sincere interest to integrate into American society, through knowledge of the country's democratic principles and values. In conclusion, Michael's superior civics knowledge played a vital role in expediting his path to American citizenship. His understanding of American history, government, and principles facilitated smoother navigation through the naturalization process in comparison to Nick, who faced a longer journey to obtain his citizenship despite his own civics abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Ali Adil Shah II was a leading hoffigur during the reign of the Bijapur Sultanate of Afzal Khan . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not convey the same information. There are subtle differences between the two sentences that result in distinct meanings. Let's examine each sentence and understand these differences. Sentence 1: During the reign of Ali Adil Shah II of Bijapur Sultanat, Afzal Khan was a leading figure of the court. This sentence mentions two historical figures: Ali Adil Shah II and Afzal Khan. Ali Adil Shah II was the ruler of the Bijapur Sultanate, and during his reign, Afzal Khan was a notable figure at his court. The main focus of this sentence is Afzal Khan and his position during the reign of Ali Adil Shah II. Sentence 2: Ali Adil Shah II was a leading hoffigur during the reign of the Bijapur Sultanate of Afzal Khan. This sentence has some confusion in its wording. It introduces Ali Adil Shah II as a leading \\"hoffigur,\\" presumably meaning a high-ranking figure, during Afzal Khan's reign as the ruler of Bijapur Sultanate. The main focus of this sentence is Ali Adil Shah II and his position during Afzal Khan's rule. However, historically, it was Ali Adil Shah II who was the ruler, and Afzal Khan was the prominent figure in the Bijapur Sultanate's court, not the ruler. Thus, this sentence mixes up the historical context compared to the first sentence. In conclusion, the two sentences do not convey the same information. The first sentence correctly presents the historical context of Afzal Khan being a leading figure during the reign of Ali Adil Shah II, ruler of the Bijapur Sultanate. In contrast, the second sentence incorrectly reverses the roles of the two historical figures, leading to confusion and a different overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
