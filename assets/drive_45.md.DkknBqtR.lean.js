The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital. After reading the above, is \\"Japanese scholars\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Japanese scholars\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\". Based on the information provided, it was the Taira and Minamoto armies who were involved in the conflict related to Kyoto, not the Japanese scholars. The text states that after rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage a four-year war. This conflict marked the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, who controlled the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies, which were based in the Kanto province east of the capital. Therefore, a more suitable answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\" would be \\"The Taira and Minamoto armies\\", and the outcome was that the Taira defeated the Minamoto. However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly say that either army \\"invaded\\" Kyoto. The text instead talks about a struggle for control over the throne. The word \\"invaded\\" is typically used to describe a military incursion by a foreign power, while this conflict appears to have been an internal power struggle within Japan. Thus the word \\"invaded\\" may not be the best descriptor for what happened in this instance based on the provided information. But again, without more context or details about the specific historical events referred to, this interpretation could be subject to change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

Given the question: Q: What is caused by human actions that releases chemical substances and particles into the air? Choices: - CFO pollution - Improper Emissions - heavy pollution - air pollution A: The answer is:","completion":"- air pollution Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that affects both developed and developing nations across the world. It is primarily caused by human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the air, thereby degrading the quality of the environment and causing various negative effects on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Several factors are responsible for the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, including: 1. Industrial processes: Industries, such as power plants, manufacturing centers, and chemical plants, are significant contributors to air pollution. These facilities release a range of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 2. Transportation: The combustion of fossil fuels in motor vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, produces a significant amount of harmful emissions, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and hydrocarbons. Moreover, air travel and shipping also contribute to air pollution through the release of exhaust fumes. 3. Agriculture: The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in farming contributes to air pollution by releasing ammonia and other harmful substances into the air. Additionally, agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and open burning of crop residues, emit methane, particulate matter, and other pollutants. 4. Residential and commercial activities: Burning of solid fuels like wood, coal, and charcoal for cooking and heating purposes, particularly in developing countries, adds to the burden of air pollution. Residential and commercial buildings may also emit VOCs from materials used in their construction, furnishings, and other household items. 5. Waste disposal: The improper handling and disposal of waste, such as open burning of garbage and emissions from landfills, can introduce hazardous pollutants into the air. 6. Deforestation and forest fires: The loss of forests due to human activities, such as logging and agriculture, is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, forest fires contribute to air pollution by releasing massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter into the atmosphere. 7. Natural events: Although not directly caused by human actions, certain natural events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires can exacerbate air pollution levels. Air pollution has numerous adverse effects on the environment and human health. It can cause respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and other health problems, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Air pollution also harms ecosystems, leads to reduced crop yields, and contributes to climate change. To address these problems, various mitigation strategies and policies have been implemented by governments worldwide, including air quality standards and regulations, public transportation initiatives, and the promotion of cleaner, renewable energy sources. Additionally, increasing public awareness and individual actions to reduce emissions can also help in tackling air pollution. In conclusion, air pollution is caused by various human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the atmosphere. It poses a significant threat to global environmental health and has far-reaching implications on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Therefore, continuous efforts must be made to combat air pollution and mitigate its adverse effects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An agricultural farm is giving prizes for the person who makes the largest homegrown project. Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference).

The fall was said to have been due to recent housing options and homelessness prevention actions offered by councils. There was also a reduction in the number of households with children in temporary accommodation. And the number of people made homeless or threatened with homelessness fell by a 10th to 7,649. The statistics showed that the number of people in temporary accommodation increased slightly over the year to June (0.3%) to 10,494 but was about 6% lower than the peak period in early 2011 when temporary placements were in excess of 12,000. The 2,821 households with children in temporary accommodation was a decrease of 472 households (14%) from the previous year. These households contained a total of 4,574 children, a decrease of 727 children (14%). The number of children in bed and breakfast accommodation halved to nine. However, the statisticians said there had not been a major change in the underlying drivers of homelessness. Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess welcomed the \\"continued fall in homelessness across Scotland\\", which she said built on the Scottish government's \\"historic achievement\\" in meeting the homelessness 2012 target. She added: \\"Over the past few years councils have been developing services in which staff assist households to consider their range of housing options to address their individual housing needs in order to help prevent homelessness before it occurs. \\"Alongside this we want to increase housing supply to ensure settled accommodation can be accessed by households as quickly as possible and avoid them spending too much time in temporary accommodation. \\"Increasing the supply of affordable housing is a vital part of our efforts to build a better and fairer Scotland.\\" The Scottish government aims to deliver 30,000 affordable homes - including 20,000 for social rent - over the life of the current parliament. It is also to make Â£900m available for affordable housing over the next three years. The Scottish Conservatives said the number of people in temporary homeless accommodation had increased from 8,523 to 10,494 since the SNP came to power in 2007. The party claimed a failure by the Scottish government to build new houses had contributed to the issue. Scottish Conservative housing spokesman Alex Johnstone said: \\"There will always be a need for temporary accommodation in Scotland. \\"However, the use of B&Bs and hotels should be absolutely discouraged, because this is not suitable accommodation for anyone. \\"Some families and individuals can be in these settings for long periods of time, a situation which is anything but temporary.\\" Scottish Labour welfare spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \\"Whilst the number of households with children in temporary accommodation is decreasing, the fact that there are a thousand more such households now than a decade ago raises significant questions about how the SNP government is trying to tackle homelessness. \\"It can be no surprise that the numbers have remained stubbornly high after the SNP withdrew millions from the house building budget, which has seen a collapse in the number of new homes for rent.\\" Graeme Brown, director of housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: \\"It is good news that 11% fewer families and individuals are experiencing the trauma of homelessness. \\"However, homelessness in Scotland is still too high and we cannot afford to be complacent or lose sight of the fact that over 7,649 households found themselves homeless in just three months.\\" He added: \\"The root cause of homelessness is a housing crisis which has seen the housing safety net stripped apart after decades of under-investment. \\"The only way forward is for the Scottish government to build at least 10,000 new social homes a year to bring hope to the 155,100 on local authority housing waiting lists and much-needed jobs to the construction sector.\\" David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the ongoing reduction was down to the strong emphasis in Scottish government policy placed upon homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment. But he added: \\"We are concerned that, with the rollout of the UK coalition government's welfare reforms, come some serious challenges to homelessness service provision which could undermine some of the excellent homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment work carried out by social landlords and others here in Scotland.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a decrease in the number of homeless people in Scotland.

The high-flying lawyer, married to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family. Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores, with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons. Miriam Clegg insisted she does not want to 'have it all', but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life. Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow. In a surprise intervention at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mrs Clegg spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'. But speaking to Sky News, she made clear that the decision to choose Mr Clegg as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations. And she said she had been fortunate to be able 'naturally' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg was speaking during a visit to a Glasgow college to address female students as part of the Inspiring Women campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models. Asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can 'have it all', Mrs Clegg told Sky News: 'I never understand what people mean when they say 'having it all'. I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. 'Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. 'There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. 'But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with.' Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband Nick does his share of the household chores, and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons. Nick and Miriam Clegg visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow. Nick Clegg has looked to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday. She made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was ready to share housework with her, and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. 'There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children,' she said. 'If you look across society and across different countries, certainly in the Western world, women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and I certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day's work at home, and when they get home there is the other half to do. 'That doesn't happen to me. It is not an issue for people like you and I who can get help. It is an issue for those who can't get help, who don't have the money or circumstances to get help. Asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high-flying careers with a family life, she said: 'Life is all about compromises. 'There is always a certain equilibrium and in my case, we found it naturally, but I do understand that there are people who plan. I'm just not very good with plans. 'We tend to share it very naturally. We make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage.' Mrs Clegg said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life, and felt it was important to give girls the self-confidence to aim high in the world of work. 'I think we have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little bit more progress to make,' she said. 'I think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them. 'I haven't come across open discrimination against me. In terms of a little hidden sexism, I think there are lots of women who do face that.' Mrs Clegg yesterday joined her husband on a visit to Castlehill Primary School, Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Clegg said that when speaking to young women around the UK, 'something I have really noticed that I don't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self-confidence'. She added: 'I wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there, and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects. 'I do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys.' Asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls, Mrs Clegg said: 'Not necessarily. I go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you. 'If you really want to summarise what I hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain, I hope it is that.' Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband's question-and-answer session.

David brings his eight-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and Norton to a grocery store, where the patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Moments after a panicked and injured man, Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn), runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren. A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on the windows and pterodactyl-like animals attack them, breaking the glass and allowing the creatures to begin fighting inside the store. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors. A trip to the neighboring pharmacy to gather medical supplies goes horribly wrong and two people are killed by giant spiders. Mrs. Carmody's faction now contains most of the survivors.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the common English name of the animal that has eight subspecies?, using the article: The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The common English name of the animal with eight subspecies, as described in the article, is the hartebeest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Early breakaway riders Thomas de Gendt, Wilco Kelderman and Cyril Gautier were caught with 200 metres remaining. Britain's Froome, 30, remains two minutes and 52 seconds ahead of second-placed Tejay van Garderen. American Van Garderen, who finished 10th but with the same time as Froome, had few opportunities to make up ground on the yellow jersey holder on a stage that lacked drama until the final minutes. Froome, having showed his resilience in the previous stage by holding off attacks from his general classification rivals, had a more straightforward time in the peloton on a day when temperatures of up to 38C proved the most troubling factor for riders. The steep finish on Saturday's 178.5km route to Mende may offer slight grounds for optimism to Froome's prospective GC contenders. \\"We already saw on a 500m climb like today gaps opening up, so tomorrow on a climb like Mende at 3km and more than 10%, I definitely think the general classification guys will be fighting to gain time,\\" said Froome. Stage 13 came agonisingly close to being won by a breakaway rider, but Belgian De Gendt, Dutchman Kelderman and France's Gautier, having led the field for the whole day, were overhauled by the peloton on the streets of Rodez with the finish line in sight. The final incline allowed the peloton to catch them with BMC rider Van Avermaet, 30, claiming his first Tour stage win by finishing stronger than Sagan, who has not won a Tour stage in two years. \\"I was dead, really dead,'' said Van Avermaet. \\"I thought I'd caught second. I pushed for the line and was so happy he didn't overtake me.\\" The result takes Tinkoff-Saxo rider Sagan's number of second-place finishes in his Tour career to 15, compared with just four victories. Sagan, 25, who keeps hold of the green points jersey, told ITV4: \\"It's not about luck. It was my mistake for waiting too long. \\"I was pushing in the saddle and then sat down.

Please write a short summary for the following article: For Health Care for All chief, a spiritual shift Chris Morris for the boston globe Amy Whitcomb Slemmer is on track to be ordained in June. After eight years as executive director of Boston-based Health Care for All, Amy Whitcomb Slemmer (right) is passing the baton — and as of next year her new title may be “The Rev. Amy Whitcomb Slemmer.” While leading the nonprofit advocacy group, Slemmer, a lawyer, has been studying to become an Episcopal priest. She is now enrolled in her final seminary class and on track to be ordained in June, contingent on the approval of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, Alan M. Gates. But she is confident enough in her path to the priesthood that she has submitted her resignation from Health Care for All, effective Oct. 15, although she’s not yet sure what her new religious life will be or if she’ll remain in Massachusetts. “I am deciding and figuring out my next professional adventure,” said Slemmer, noting that she does not feel drawn to parish ministry. “I know I am most excited when I get to work on issues of social justice, and I am positive that whatever my next job is will include the intersection of my faith and my pull to work on social justice.” Slemmer, 52, has felt the tug of the priesthood since she was a teenager, but delayed pursuing that aspiration because she was a single mother and wanted to focus on raising her daughter, who is now in her 20s. During Slemmer’s tenure at Health Care for All, the organization helped implement Massachusetts health care reform, enrolling thousands of people in health insurance. She was previously executive officer of American Red Cross Biomedical Services in Washington, D.C. Following Slemmer’s departure, Health Care for All’s interim executive director will be its founder, Rob Restuccia, who is now executive director of Community Catalyst, a Boston nonprofit that advocates for affordable health care. — SACHA PFEIFFER Early findings from the city of Boston’s groundbreaking gender wage project are starting to come in, as Mayor Marty Walsh and local CEOs meet on Friday to dissect the data. The information comes from the first batch of about 70 companies that have volunteered to participate in the project so they can better understand why pay disparities exist. Over 160 companies — including Partners Healthcare, State Street, Putnam Investments, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals — have agreed to report pay data to the city. Since the data collection is at an early stage, the numbers won’t be released publicly. About 200 executives and managers are expected to attend the event with roundtable discussions led by 18 CEOs. Among those expected include Staples CEO Shira Goodman, Massachusetts General Physicians Organization CEO Thomas Lynch, Children’s Hospital CEO Sandra Fenwick, and Babson College president Kerry Healey. “We are so appreciative to have the leadership of these 160 companies to engage in this very important dialogue on how we go beyond legislation and change culture to close the gender wage gap in Boston,” said Meg Costello, executive director of Mayor Walsh’s office of women’s advancement. — SHIRLEY LEUNG Houghton Mifflin Harcourt may have shown Linda Zecher the door, but the company isn’t eager to let her management team walk away. Zecher resigned from her job as chief executive at the Boston-based publisher last week, following a rocky year for the company’s stock. The board appointed former Wall Street Journal publisher L. Gordon Crovitz to be interim CEO while the search for a new chief executive is underway. Crovitz has been a board member at HMH since 2012. Crovitz is currently a partner in NextNews Ventures, which invests in early-stage news startups. Meanwhile, HMH offered cash retention bonuses to chief financial officer Joe Abbott, executive vice president Lee Ramsayer, chief content officer Mary Cullinane, and general counsel William Bayers. They’ll be payable in two installments: The execs will get one half if they stay on for a full year, and they’ll get the rest after two years. Bayers’s bonus is 250,000 while the others would get 500,000. Larry Fish, the former Citizens Bank CEO who is now HMH’s chairman, issued a statement praising Zecher for her work. He also gave props to Zecher’s top lieutenants, calling them “world class.” Public praise, of course, can help employee morale, and do wonders for executive retention. But extra money doesn’t hurt, either. — JON CHESTO It’s official: Governor Charlie Baker will head to Israel in December for his first overseas trade mission. Boston business leaders have long expected Baker to participate in the upcoming trade mission, although Baker’s aides didn’t confirm it until Wednesday. The governor is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Dec. 9 and to depart on Dec. 14, returning home early on Dec. 15. The trade mission will focus on the cybersecurity and digital health sectors. One goal: encouraging Israeli companies that are seeking their first US outpost to pick Massachusetts. “I want Massachusetts to be a place that companies and researchers and investors in Israeli enterprises in this space choose to partner with, as opposed to going to Silicon Valley or New York,” Baker said. Roughly a dozen state officials will attend the trip, including: Katie Stebbins, assistant secretary of innovation and technology; Louis Gutierrez, executive director of the Mass. Health Connector; and Mark Nunnelly, executive director of the state’s information technology office. The administration is still lining up private-sector participants; nearly 40 are expected to attend. The New England-Israel Business Council is playing a key role. No public funds will be used for the upcoming Israel visit. Instead, it will be funded by Combined Jewish Philanthropies, much like the June trip. (Business leaders typically pay their own way.) “They came back from that [June trip], saying there’s a tremendous opportunity,” Baker said. “If they came back from that trip and said, ‘There really aren’t a lot of possibilities here,’ we wouldn’t be doing this.” — JON CHESTO Summary:","completion":"Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, the executive director of Boston nonprofit Health Care for All, is set to resign on October 15th to become an Episcopal priest.

Title: The White Ribbon Movie plot: The action takes place in a German village in the fifteen months that precede World War I.Among the people who live there are a baron, who is a large landowner and a local moral authority, his estate manager, a pastor with his many children, a widowed doctor and a schoolteacher who is thinking of getting married. It is he who, many years later, tells this story.Though everything seems to be quiet and orderly, as it always has been, with the seasons following each other, and good harvests following bad ones, suddenly some strange events start to occur. If some appear to be quite ordinary, even accidental -- a farmer's wife dies falling through rotten floorboards -- others are inexplicable and may well be malevolent.Thus, a wire placed at knee-height has brought down the horse being ridden by the doctor, who is severely wounded.There's more of the same: an unknown hand opens a window to expose a newborn baby to the intense cold of the winter. A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip. A barn belonging to the manor is set on fire. A farmer hangs himself. A midwife's handicapped child is found tied to a tree, in a forest, seriously beaten, with a threatening message on his chest speaking of divine punishment.The village is worried, and at a loss as to what to do. The baron whose wife will soon leave the village to go to live in Italy makes a speech in the church, but it has no effect. The pastor, a particularly strict character, had since the beginning of the events, tied a white ribbon to the arm of his two eldest children, a boy and a girl: it is to remind them permanently of their duties to purity.

The answer is:","completion":"Al Capone, the infamous American gangster, went to jail at multiple locations during his notorious criminal career. However, his most famous stint in prison took place at the United States Penitentiary, Alcatraz Island, more commonly known as Alcatraz or \\"The Rock.\\" Capone's criminal activities came under increasing scrutiny by federal authorities, especially for his involvement in the illegal liquor trade during the Prohibition era. Nevertheless, it was tax evasion charges that eventually brought Capone down. He was indicted by the federal government on various charges in 1931, and on October 17, 1931, he was convicted of five counts of tax evasion and two of failure to file tax returns. Initially, Capone was incarcerated at the Cook County Jail in Chicago while awaiting sentencing. On October 24, 1931, he was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison, fined 50,000, charged 7,692 for court costs, and required to pay an additional 215,000 plus interest in back taxes. This was one of the harshest punishment ever handed down in a tax evasion case up to that point. Capone began serving his term on May 4, 1932, at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. However, Capone's status started causing trouble in the prison, as he managed to gain special privileges and smuggle in luxuries. In response, the authorities decided to transfer him to a more secure, escape-proof, and highly disciplined institution – Alcatraz. On August 22, 1934, Al Capone was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, where he would serve almost five years of his sentence. Alcatraz was notorious for its high level of security and strict rules, and Capone would not receive any special treatment. During his time on the island, he struggled with health issues. He battled with paresis, a complication resulting from late-stage syphilis, and his physical and mental condition began to deteriorate. In January 1939, Capone was transferred to another federal prison, Terminal Island, in Southern California, as his condition worsened, and he required further medical attention. He was finally released on November 18, 1939, after serving approximately seven and a half years of his initial 11-year sentence. In summary, Al Capone served time in multiple jails: Cook County Jail in Chicago, the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, and finally, Terminal Island in Southern California. However, it was his stay at Alcatraz that remains the most famous and emblematic of his time in incarceration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Brad and Henry were two old friends in their 70's. Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol. But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. What is an answer for this question: Which friend takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Answer:","completion":"In the given situation, Brad and Henry are two old friends in their 70's, with Brad having very high levels of cholesterol while Henry has normal cholesterol levels. From the provided background information, we know that individuals with high cholesterol often take a specific type of drug called a statin. Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These drugs work by inducing the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. Increased levels of LDL receptors lead to increased catabolism of plasma LDL, effectively removing cholesterol from the plasma and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Considering this information, it would be reasonable to infer that Brad, who has very high cholesterol levels, is the friend that takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This is because Brad's high cholesterol levels make him more susceptible to atherosclerosis, and thus, he requires medical intervention to help manage his cholesterol levels. By taking a statin, Brad can potentially lower his cholesterol, as the drug promotes the increased expression of LDL receptors and the removal of cholesterol from his plasma. On the other hand, Henry has normal cholesterol levels and is generally healthier. It is likely that he does not require a statin to manage his cholesterol levels, as his body is already maintaining an appropriate balance. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of statins can vary among individuals due to different genetic backgrounds and factors related to pharmacogenomics. The varying responses to the drug among individuals are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms, which contribute to the uniqueness of each person's genetic makeup. As a result, different versions of statins exist, allowing healthcare professionals to identify and apply the most effective combination of drugs for each individual. In summary, it is likely that Brad, who has high cholesterol levels, is the friend who takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This medication is designed to help him manage his cholesterol levels and prevent atherosclerosis, while Henry's normal cholesterol levels likely do not necessitate the use of such a drug."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Well, for the never fear the heart of the snake part, it'll take a little while. Oh, yeah: as soon as the snake is out of the jar, it starts growing. And growing. And growing. From this point on, it's a pretty paint-by-number story: the sheriff doesn't believe the story that Les is saying, the mayor doesn't want to stop the local fair the whole city will attend as they didn't have anything better to do, two bizarre hunters who live in the woods want to get the snake \\"their way,\\" a bunch of sheriff's assistants with no name hang around waiting to become snake nibbles, and so on and so forth. But when Les' ex-ex-girlfriend (Siri Baruc) gets swallowed whole by the mega snake, Les understands the never fear the heart part, and literally delves inside the matter, solving the problems from within. Overall, silly. Answer:","completion":"The rules Les has to follow are: don't let the snake out of the jar, don't let it eat anything living, and never fear the heart of the snake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both sentences convey the same information—the source of the information (Iranian state news agency PressTV), the organization that conducted the poll (The Doha Debates), and the key finding of the poll (55% of Syrian respondents did not want Assad to resign). Although the sentences are worded differently, they communicate the same message. Sentence (1) uses the word \\"poll\\" whereas Sentence (2) uses the word \\"survey\\" – both terms typically refer to a method of collecting opinions or information from a sample of people, usually to generalize about a larger population. So, in this context, they can be considered synonyms. Additionally, both sentences use the term \\"respondents\\" to describe the individuals who participated in the poll or survey. This term refers to the people who provided their opinions or responses, and it is a standard term used in polling and survey research. As such, the sentences convey the same meaning with respect to the participants in the poll/survey. In summary, there is no meaningful difference in the information conveyed by these two sentences. Both provide a summary of the poll results as reported by the Iranian state news agency, PressTV, and conducted by The Doha Debates.

The answer is:","completion":"No, OK Go and Ozma were not from the same city. OK Go is an American alternative rock band which was originally formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998, while Ozma is an American rock band that was formed in Pasadena, California, in 1995. Let us delve deeper into the background and history of each band. OK Go's founding members include Damian Kulash (vocals, guitar), Tim Nordwind (bass, vocals), Dan Konopka (drums, percussion), and Andy Ross (guitar, keyboards, and vocals). The band originally was formed based on Kulash's and Nordwind's friendship since their pre-college years. During their time at the Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan, they bonded over their shared love for music and formed the foundation of what would later become OK Go. The name \\"OK Go\\" is derived from an art teacher's verbal cue, which the duo found amusing, and they adopted it as their band name. The band gained popularity primarily for their innovative and creative music videos, which often feature intricate choreography and unconventional cinematography. Some of their most notable works include the music videos for \\"Here It Goes Again,\\" which features the band members performing on treadmills, and \\"This Too Shall Pass,\\" which showcases a Rube Goldberg machine. On the other hand, Ozma, which was formed by Ryen Slegr (vocals, guitar), Jose Galvez (guitar, vocals), Patrick Edwards (drums, percussion), Daniel Brummel (bass, vocals) and Star Wick (keyboards, vocals), drew its name from the mythical Queen Ozma of Oz, a character from L. Frank Baum's Oz books. Ozma's sound is a fusion of various musical styles, including rock, alternative, power pop, and new wave, often characterized by catchy melodies and strong guitar hooks. The band is perhaps best known for their album \\"Rock and Roll Part Three,\\" which includes popular tracks like \\"Domino Effect\\" and \\"Natalie Portman.\\" Although both bands hail from different cities and have distinct musical styles, they do share some similarities, such as the usage of catchy hooks, innovative ideas, and strong fan bases. Additionally, OK Go and Ozma have both toured together and shared the stage on multiple occasions, further solidifying their connection in the American rock and alternative music scene. In conclusion, OK Go and Ozma do not come from the same city – OK Go originated in Chicago, Illinois, while Ozma was formed in Pasadena, California. Although their geographical locations are different, their shared passion for music, sense of innovation, and collaboration in the music scene have brought them together in various instances, making them relevant and influential names in the world of alternative and rock music over the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet is heading towards the earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the earth. On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out. Will we meet the same end? Question: Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The northern half of the earth can't escape for long because of the global consequences of the comet's impact. After the explosions, the sun gets hidden by the clouds of dust produced from the impacts, causing temperatures around the world to fall to almost zero.

Possible answers: [1]. no; [2]. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. They both revolve around the impact of alcohol on health, with Question 1 asking if alcohol is good for health and Question 2 inquiring about the potential positive or negative effects of drinking alcohol on health. Although the wording is slightly different, the core inquiry of both questions remains the same. The impact of alcohol on health can be quite complex, and it can be both good and bad depending on the amount consumed, individual factors, and the type of alcohol being consumed. Studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, particularly of wine, can have some benefits for certain individuals in terms of heart health, digestion, and stress reduction. However, these benefits should be weighed against the potential negative effects of alcohol consumption. On the other hand, excessive alcohol consumption has been clearly associated with several health issues, including liver damage, addiction, a weakened immune system, increased risk of certain cancers, and psychological disorders. It can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and interfere with certain medications. Binge drinking is particularly harmful and can lead to severe health issues, as well as accidents and injuries. It is essential for individuals to assess their personal risk factors and the potential benefits and drawbacks when considering their level of alcohol consumption. Some people may have a higher risk of developing health problems due to alcohol than others, and factors such as family history, age, existing health conditions, and individual reactions to alcohol should all be considered. In some cases, it might be advisable to avoid alcohol entirely. In conclusion, while alcohol can have some health benefits when consumed moderately and responsibly, it can also have serious negative effects on an individual's health if consumed irresponsibly or excessively. It is crucial for people to be aware of their personal risk factors and to understand the potential consequences of their alcohol consumption habits, in order to make informed decisions about their health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. The answer is:","completion":"Ethan Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the paragraph The relevant information can be found in the sentence: \\"He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.\\" Step 2: Determine the context of the surrender demand From the same sentence, we understand that the surrender demand was made by a person whose first name is asked.

Kashe, an electrical engineer from Diamond Bar, California, seeks unspecified damages of at least 10,000 plus attorney fees. His attorney, Larry Weinsteen, said Kashe and his wife were big Stewart fans who traveled to Las Vegas primarily for the concert. The lawyer said his client was treated by a hotel medic and filed an injury report with Caesars before being left with 'substantial' injuries including an impaired sense of smell. Stewart is known for hits including 'Maggie May' and 'Tonight's the Night.' The 69-year-old London-born rocker also is a longtime soccer fan and club league player. He frequently kicks autographed balls into the audience at his shows. Family man: Rod pictured with his wife Penny Lancaster this week in Beverly Hills.

Mostafa says he has lingering injuries and wants money to help pay for them. This lawsuit is a way for Mostafa to ask the people involved in the concert, like Rod Stewart, the promoter AEG Live, and Caesars Entertainment Corp., to take responsibility for what happened and help him out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \\"blueblood\\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \\"blue blood\\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \\"blue\\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels stood out appearing blue.

Background: Elizabeth of York (11 February 1466 - 11 February 1503) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death. As the wife of Henry VII, she was the first Tudor queen. She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III, and she married the king following Henry's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses. She was the mother of King Henry VIII. Context: Elizabeth's mother made an alliance with Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII, who had the closest claim to the throne of those in the Lancastrian party. Although Henry Tudor was descended from King Edward III, his claim to the throne was weak, due to an act of parliament passed during the reign of Richard II in the 1390s, that barred accession to the throne to any heirs of the legitimised offspring of Henry's great-great-grandparents, John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford. Despite this, his mother and Elizabeth Woodville agreed Henry should move to claim the throne and, once he had taken it, marry Elizabeth of York to unite the two rival houses. In December 1483, in the cathedral in Rennes, Henry Tudor swore an oath promising to marry her and began planning an invasion. In 1484, Elizabeth of York and her sisters left Westminster Abbey and returned to court when Elizabeth Woodville was reconciled with Richard III, which may suggest that Elizabeth Woodville believed Richard III to be innocent of any possible role in the murder of her two sons (although this is unlikely owing to her involvement in Henry Tudor's failed invasion of October 1483). It was rumoured that Richard III intended to marry Elizabeth of York because his wife, Anne Neville, was dying and they had no surviving children. The Crowland Chronicle claimed that Richard III was forced to deny this unsavoury rumour. Soon after Anne Neville's death, Richard III sent Elizabeth away from court to the castle of Sheriff Hutton and opened negotiations with King John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joan, Princess of Portugal, and to have Elizabeth marry their cousin, the future King Manuel I of Portugal. On 7 August 1485, Henry Tudor and his army landed in Wales and began marching inland. On 22 August 1485, Henry Tudor and Richard III fought the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard III, despite having the larger army, was betrayed by one of his most powerful retainers, William Stanley, and died in battle. Henry Tudor took the crown by right of conquest as Henry VII.

Write an article using the following points: Danny Purdy saved up £7 of his own money for a haircut like his hero. The nine-year-old had his hair styled like that of Arsenal star Olivier Giroud. However, he arrived home in tears after teachers told him off about the cut. He will be isolated at his Bedfordshire school until his hair is 'rectified' Article:","completion":"Title: 9-Year-Old Danny Purdy Faces Isolation Over Haircut Inspired by Football Hero Olivier Giroud Introduction: Danny Purdy, a nine-year-old boy from Bedfordshire, was excited to finally get a haircut modeled after his football hero, Arsenal star Olivier Giroud. After saving up £7 of his own money, Danny got his dream haircut, only to be left in tears when his teachers took issue with the style. Step 1: Establish the significance of the story This incident of a young boy being reprimanded for emulating his hero highlights the ongoing debate surrounding strict school dress codes and how they may affect students' self-expression and identity development. Step 2: Describe the specific haircut Danny Purdy carefully saved up his pocket money to get a haircut resemlling that of his favorite football player, Olivier Giroud. The hairstyle features a distinctive undercut, with shorter sides and a longer top, giving it a bold and unique look that has become a signature style for the Arsenal star. Step 3: Discuss the school's reaction Upon arriving at school with his new haircut, Danny was met with disapproval by his teachers. They deemed the style inappropriate and informed him that he would be isolated from his peers until the haircut was 'rectified.' This left the nine-year-old devastated and in tears. Step 4: Consider the impact on the child The condemnation of Danny's haircut by his school has raised concerns about the potential emotional impact on the young boy. The tears shed by Danny upon returning home suggest that the school's response has already taken a toll on his self-esteem and enthusiasm for expressing himself through his appearance. Step 5: Analyze the broader implications of dress code enforcement Danny's story raises the question of whether strict enforcement of school dress codes, including hairstyles, is appropriate or fair to students. While schools may argue that such policies promote a sense of unity and professionalism, critics contend that they may hinder creativity, individuality, and self-expression in children. Conclusion: The case of young Danny Purdy and his Olivier Giroud-inspired haircut serves as a reminder of the delicate balance that must be struck between upholding school dress codes and respecting students' personal identities. In light of Danny's emotional response to the school's demands, it may be time for a broader reconsideration of school policies that prioritize conformity and uniformity over individuality and self-expression."},{"prompt":"Question: Title: Not worth the 30 bucks Product review: This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history.

Summarize this article: A top producer of “The View” has been fired by ABC brass for brashly berating former host Rosie O’Donnell in front of the show’s entire staff, Page Six has exclusively learned. Jennifer Shepard-Brookman, a senior producer who has worked at the ABC daytime show for over eight years, was “profoundly and publicly disrespectful” to O’Donnell in front of the whole staff at a production meeting in early February, show insiders told us. Shepard-Brookman’s behavior towards O’Donnell was so brutal, we’re told that staff, including O’Donnell herself, complained to ABC’s human resources department. Shepard-Brookman, 45, was initially suspended in mid-February, but was fired from “The View” last week, multiple sources confirmed. One show insider said: “During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, ‘If you have something to say, say it to my face!’ So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match. Jennifer was loud, and profoundly and publicly disrespectful to Rosie.” The source continued, “You have to be mindful of your role and the pecking order. Producers cannot be publicly disrespectful to the talent, no matter how much you disagree. You have to know your place. It was so shocking, Rosie and other members of staff told the HR department about Jennifer’s behavior — she was suspended and then she was fired.” Other sources say the internal investigation into the on-set skirmish reported its findings all the way up to Ben Sherwood, now the president of Disney/ABC Television Group. The daytime drama took place just before O’Donnell announced she was leaving “The View” to take care of her kids amid her divorce from wife Michelle Rounds, and to focus on her health. Her farewell show was on Feb. 12. Cindi Berger, spokeswoman for O’Donnell, said, “There are so many behind-the-scenes stories at ‘The View,’ this is yet another.” A rep for the program sniffed, “We don’t comment on rumor, speculation or gossip.” Brookman didn’t get back to us. ||||| Rosie O’Donnell is a total bully who intimidated staff when she was co-host of ABC’s “The View” — and even got a producer fired for suspected media leaks, a new lawsuit charges. O’Donnell targeted senior producer Jennifer Shepard-Brookman for shifting coverage of the ISIS beheading of US journalist James Foley to co-host Whoopi Goldberg, according to Brookman’s defamation suit filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court. During the September 2014 incident, O’Donnell went on a tirade while getting right in Shepard-Brookman’s face, the suit says. “My client started crying. She was scared of Rosie and thought she was going to be assaulted,” said Shepard-Brookman’s attorney, Brian Kennedy. O’Donnell also got Shepard-Brookman fired out of spite, the suit alleges. O’Donnell’s lawyer, Nicolle Jacoby, called the claims “baseless.” ||||| Rosie O’Donnell and her ex, Michelle Rounds, were in court on Wednesday to determine custody of their 2-year-old daughter, Dakota. When the hearing was over, the former couple left with an agreement for joint custody. Outside the courtroom, ET caught up with Rounds’ attorney, who said that his client was happy with the agreement, while O'Donnell joked to reporters that, \\"There's peace in the Middle East.\\" \\"It's done,\\" the 53-year-old TV personality said in a statement to ET. \\"We’ve settled. We’re both very happy about the outcome.\\" Rounds spoke to ET earlier this year about the custody battle, saying that she would \\"walk away' from the couple’s prenuptial agreement if O’Donnell, who filed for divorce in February, would give her full custody of their daughter. \\"I made my first million before the age of 39, that was before I met Rosie. I don't need Rosie's money,\\" Rounds, a former IT consultant, said at the time. \\"I don't want Rosie's money. Nothing was in my name. The prenup money means nothing to me.\\" Rounds stressed that, in seeking full custody, she was looking to provide a \\"healthier\\" and \\"way more protective\\" environment for her daughter. The couple adopted Dakota as an infant in January 2013, after marrying in June 2012. \\"I just want my child to have the best possible environment to grow up in, a normal life,” Rounds told ET. “Right now she's got 24/7 nannies over there at Rosie's house. I don't want my child to have a 24/7 nanny.\\" \\"[Rosie] leaves the baby overnight with nannies,\\" O’Donnell’s ex also alleged. \\"She has the monitor in the nanny's room.\\" Rounds added that the couple’s parenting style was a major source of conflict in their marriage. ||||| Jennifer Shepard-Brookman says the former 'View' host told producers she leaked negative stories to the media. A former senior producer of The View has sued Rosie O’Donnell, claiming the former co-host of the ABC daytime program got her fired by slandering her in front of the show's other producers and staff. Jennifer Shepard-Brookman claimed she was fired in 2015 after having worked on The View since 2001. Her complaint, filed Thursday in New York state court, states that O’Donnell resented long-standing moderator Whoopi Goldberg and wanted to unseat her from the moderator spot. Shepard-Brookman claimed O'Donnell \\"accused Ms. Brookman of teaming with Ms. Goldberg to undermine Ms. O'Donnell.\\" For instance, Shepard-Brookman said O'Donnell thought she conspired to shift the coverage of the Islamic State group's beheading of journalist James Foley from O’Donnell to Goldberg. \\"At that time, Ms. O'Donnell intimidated Ms. Brookman by screaming that she 'owned' the story and was upset that Ms. Goldberg covered the story, and by grabbing the arms of the chair in which Ms. Brookman was sitting, leaning very close to her face and prohibiting her from leaving,\\" states the complaint. In the year following O’Donnell’s return to The View, Shepard-Brookman said, \\"Numerous stories appeared in the media\\" about O'Donnell's \\"acrimonious\\" relationship with the producers, other hosts and staff. (O'Donnell left the show in February citing personal reasons.) The complaint states that O'Donnell \\"publicly accused Ms. Brookman of betraying professional and personal confidences and leaking certain sensitive information to the media\\" in a meeting in January with producers including View executive producer Bill Wolff (who himself left in August). O'Donnell continued to spread the false accusations after the meeting, said Shepard-Brookman. \\"To be clear, Ms. Brookman denies that she ever leaked any such information about the show to the media,\\" states the complaint. Her complaint only states one cause of action, slander per se, which she says \\"caused [her] to suffer intense emotional distress … destroyed her professional reputation and led to her termination of employment.\\" Shepard-Brookman seeks unspecified damages.

Both sentences are about a person named Jessica Lynch who was a prisoner of war. She was captured by people from Iraq. Both sentences also talk about Jessica and the bad thing that happened to her while she was captured - she was raped, which means someone hurt her in a very bad and private way. But, the sentences aren't exactly the same: In the first sentence, some doctors from Iraq who took care of Jessica say that what is written in her life story book about her being raped is not true. They don't believe that it happened. In the second sentence, people from her hometown are feeling very proud of Jessica because she was brave enough to share the difficult story of her being raped by those Iraqi people who captured her.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: Where can we most probably read this passage?

The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then. - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games. - Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA), in which competitors are subject to only limited restrictions on their swimming stroke, affording the swimmer great freedom in style. Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances reaching 1500m (1650 yards). The stroke used almost universally in freestyle races is the front crawl, as this style is generally the fastest. For this reason, the term \\"freestyle\\" is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for \\"front crawl\\" when in fact it means one is mostly free to choose a style. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states.

Answer the following question: Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The text refers to the category of \\"plant.\\" In specific, Eureiandra balfourii is a species of plant in the Cucurbitaceae family, which is endemic to Yemen and found in subtropical or tropical dry forests. The Cucurbitaceae family, also known as the gourd family, consists of about 975 species in around 98 genera. Some well-known plants belonging to this family include cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash. Eureiandra balfourii's natural habitat represents the ecological environment where it is commonly found, which is in subtropical or tropical dry forests. These dry forests are characterized by a seasonal climate with a lengthy dry season and a short wet season. The flora and fauna in these regions have adapted to withstand periods of limited water availability. Such adaptations in plants may include deep root systems that can access water deep in the soil, the ability to store water in various plant tissues, or physiological mechanisms for water conservation. Endemism, in the context of the plant species Eureiandra balfourii, means that the plant is native only to a specific geographic region—in this case, Yemen. Often, endemic species are the result of long-term isolation that enabled unique evolutionary development in a particular area, ultimately becoming distinguishable from other species in the same family or genus. Due to their limited range, endemic species can be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss, climate change, and human interference. As a result, their conservation becomes a critical concern for maintaining botanical and ecosystem diversity. In summary, the text refers to Eureiandra balfourii, a plant species belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. This species is endemic to Yemen, growing in subtropical or tropical dry forests unique to that region. The categorization of Eureiandra balfourii falls under the category of \\"plant,\\" shedding light on its characteristics, native habitat, and ecological implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Moon and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Moon. This astronomical event can only happen during a Full Moon when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned. The rarity of this specific lunar eclipse is due to its length, making it a special event for stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts in Maryland and other regions with clear visibility. In this instance, the topic falls under the Science/Tech category because it involves celestial bodies, astronomical phenomena, and the observation of such events. It is important to note that the occurrence of lunar eclipses and understanding, forecasting, and observing them is a scientific practice conducted by experts in the field of astronomy. Lunar eclipses can be total, partial, or penumbral, depending on the extent to which the Earth's shadow covers the Moon. During total lunar eclipses, the Moon may appear reddish due to the Earth's atmosphere filtering sunlight and only allowing certain wavelengths to reach the Moon. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering and is the same reason why sunrises and sunsets have a reddish hue. Lunar eclipses are significant for scientific research, as they provide opportunities for astronomers to study the Earth's atmosphere, the Moon's surface, and other celestial phenomena. Furthermore, the alignment of celestial bodies during a lunar eclipse allows researchers to analyze the dynamics of our solar system more accurately. In conclusion, the rarity of this particular lunar eclipse and its unusual length are of particular interest in the Science/Tech field. It presents an opportunity for astronomers, researchers, and enthusiasts to witness a fascinating celestial event while gaining valuable knowledge about the functioning of our solar system, the Earth's atmosphere, and the Moon's surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Feeling too ill to sit in class, Baker had sought refuge in the office of her father, then the head of the lower school at Forsyth Country Day, where she was a student. “This is so bad, one of the worst stories ever,” she said. “I was on his email and an email popped up from my pediatrician saying the diagnosis.” Her parents, Norris and Kimberley, sat down with her that night to discuss the disease. By then, she had typed “Crohn’s” into an internet search and had read what she called “horrible stories” about people having to have their intestines cut out. “It was the worst feeling in the world,” she said, pausing to wipe away tears. “I love swimming more than anything in the entire world, and I thought my swimming career was over.” The next year was a blur of doctors’ offices and medical tests and illnesses, including whooping cough and a broken rib sustained during a violent coughing episode. The first Crohn’s treatment she was put on involved a daily regimen of more than a dozen pills, but it was ineffective. Eighth grade was a nightmare, Baker said. Already thin, she lost more than 10 pounds, prompting her mother to feed her a cheeseburger and a 500-calorie piece of cheesecake each night to try to keep her weight up. “For years afterward,” Baker said, “I could not eat those foods because I hated them so much.” When people at school or at swimming commented on her weight loss, Baker told them she was dealing with stomach problems. “I didn’t want to be known as that sick kid,” she said. Her health began to stabilize after her treatment was changed to incorporate monthly intravenous infusions that consumed most of two days, including one for recovery. But after a few years, the infusions ceased to be effective, and Baker began a regimen she continues to follow that includes giving herself biweekly injections in the abdomen. As Baker sought to manage the disease, training through bouts of stomach cramps, nausea and diarrhea, her parents and older sister, Rachel, strained under the weight of her struggles. Kimberley Baker sometimes excused herself to take a shower just so she could release the tears that she held back in her daughter’s presence. Rachel, who swims at Washington & Lee University, struggled to understand why the disease had targeted her sister and not her. “Of course, I’ve thought ‘why not me?’” Baker’s sister wrote in an email. “It’s hard to watch someone you love suffer, but especially in this case, since we’re close in age, do the same sport, and she was so good while I was never going to go to the Olympics. So it seemed like I should be the sick one, not her.” Baker’s determination sometimes makes her a difficult patient. It was with great reluctance that she agreed to limit her training to one pool practice a day. Her parents, doctors and coaches have all grown exasperated trying to persuade her to back off during training, or to forgo it altogether, when she is experiencing Crohn’s flare-ups. “It was always very challenging to get Kathleen not to swim,” said Dr. Clifford, her pediatrician. “It felt like punishment to her.” Despite spending, as Baker described it, “a lot of high school and my childhood in doctors’ offices,” she steadily climbed the competitive ladder. She won four medals at the 2013 world junior championships and finished second in the 200-meter backstroke at the senior nationals the next summer. That qualified her for the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships and the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, Russia. In March, as a freshman at the University of California, Baker placed second in the 200-yard individual medley at the N.C.A.A. Division I championships but struggled to manage the cumulative stress from the Pacific-12 Conference championships and the N.C.A.A. meet. As a result, she chose to skip the 200 backstroke at the trials and concentrate on the 100. The eight-contestant field in the final included the 2012 Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin and Natalie Coughlin, a former world-record holder in the event. Baker set a personal best of 59.29 seconds to finish 27-hundredths of a second behind the winner, Olivia Smoliga. When Dr. Kappelman, in North Carolina, found out that Baker had made the Olympic team, he said he called his wife and his parents and then stepped outside his office and announced the news “as if an amazing thing had happened to my own child.” Baker’s experience on other international trips has made her adept at filling out the medical forms required by the World Anti-Doping Agency and packing her medical kit, including syringes and extra dosages of her medicine in case of emergency. The super bacteria in the waters off Rio do not worry her; Baker knows from gastrointestinal disorders. “There’ve been times where I’ve said, ‘There’s no way I’m going to go on an international team,’ but somehow it’s worked out,” said Baker, who reported this week to a pre-Olympic training camp in San Antonio. “I’ve gotten healthy enough to swim well.” Well enough to grace the biggest international stage in sports. “What this means to me,” Baker said, tearing up again, “is on a whole ’nother level.” A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2016, on page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Crohn’s Disease Fails to Stop U.S. Olympian. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the inspirational story of a young swimmer named Kathleen Baker, who overcame Crohn's Disease to become an Olympian.

A former Arab League observer in Syria has decried the organisation's monitoring mission to the country as a \\"farce\\", as the UN Security Council heard security forces had stepped up the killing of protesters after the observers' arrival. Anwar Malek, an Algerian member of the monitoring team, told Al Jazeera he resigned because of what he saw, and said that the mission was falling apart. \\"What I saw was a humanitarian disaster. The regime is not just committing one war crime, but a series of crimes against its people,\\" he said. \\"The snipers are everywhere shooting at civilians. People are being kidnapped. Prisoners are being tortured and none were released.\\" He said that security forces did not withdraw their tanks from the streets, but just hid them and then redeployed them after the observers left. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has addressed a large gathering of his supporters in the Syrian capital, Damascus. Assad, in his second speech in as many days, reiterated his accusations that the \\"homeland was reeling under the brunt of conspiracy\\". The president also said: \\"We will triumph over this conspiracy. It is dying; it’s end of their plot.\\" In a speech on Tuesday, his first public address since June, the Syrian President made some promises of reform, but no sweeping concessions that might placate an opposition determined to end more than four decades of domination by the Assad family. French journalist killed In the central city of Homs, a French journalist was among several people killed on Wednesday, becoming the first Western reporter to have died in 10 months of unrest in the country. French journalist Gilles Jacquier is the first Western reporter to have died in Syria since the uprising bagan [Reuters] Syria's state-sponsored Addounia TV, which gave a total death toll of eight, said a Dutch journalist was among 25 people wounded. France 2 television confirmed its journalists had been killed. \\"France 2 television has just learned with a great deal of sorrow the death of reporter Gilles Jacquier in Homs,\\" the channel said in a statement, adding it did not have details of the circumstances of his death. According to an AFP news agency reporter at the scene, a shell exploded amid a group of journalists covering demonstrations in the city. The United Nations has said more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since protests against Assad began last March. Assad says \\"terrorists\\" have killed 2,000 members of his security forces. Killing 'accelerated' A senior UN official told the Security Council on Tuesday that Syria had accelerated its killing of pro-democracy demonstrators after Arab League monitors arrived, according to Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations. \\"The under-secretary-general noted that in the days since the Arab League monitoring mission has been on the ground, an estimated 400 additional people have been killed, an average of 40 a day, a rate much higher than was the case before their deployment,\\" Rice said. Rice was speaking after Lynn Pascoe, UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, briefed the 15-nation Security Council behind closed doors on Syria and other major crises. \\"That is a clear indication that the government of Syria, rather than using the opportunity ... to end the violence and fulfil all of its commitments [to the Arab League], is instead stepping up the violence,\\" Rice said. Assad made scathing remarks about the Arab League, which suspended Syria in November and whose monitors are trying to check Syria's compliance with an Arab peace plan. \\"The Arab League has failed for six decades to take a position in the Arab interest,\\" he said. Attacks condemned The League condemned an attack on Monday in which 11 of its monitors were hurt by demonstrators in the port city of Latakia, saying Syria had breached its obligation to protect them. Syria said it was continuing to provide security for the observers and condemned any act that obstructed their work. Patrick Seale, author of several books on Syria, discusses Assad's speech on Tuesday But Malek told Al Jazeera that the government was not assisting observers with their requests. \\"The regime didn't meet any of our requests, in fact they were trying to deceive us and steer us away from what was really happening, towards insignificant things.\\" He said that those who were supposedly freed and were shown on TV, were actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the street. \\"They were detained for four or five days in tough conditions and later released as if they had been real prisoners.\\" Malek also said that he had seen snipers on top of buildings: \\"On one, there were even army officers in front of the building, while snipers were on the roof. \\"Some on our team preferred to maintain good relations with the regime and denied that there were snipers.\\" He said that Assad's government \\"has gained a lot of time that has helped it implement its plan ... Therefore I've decided to withdraw from this mission.\\" The Arab League has not responded to Al Jazeera's requests for a reaction to Malek's comments. ||||| Anti-government protesters carry the coffin of Muhammad Khaled Al-Kaheel, who protesters say was killed in earlier clashes with government troops, during his funeral in Qudsaya near Damascus January 9, 2012. CAIRO (Reuters) - An Arab observer delegation in Syria is running into further difficulties, with two members either quitting or threatening to do so within 24 hours because their mission is proving ineffectual in ending the suffering of civilians. An observer who declined to give his name said on Wednesday he was ready to walk out, exposing rifts in an Arab peace effort a day after Anwar Malek, an Algerian observer, told Al Jazeera TV he had quit Syria because the peace mission was a \\"farce.\\" Both men, clearly appalled by what they had seen, spoke of continued violence, killings and torture, saying the bloodshed had not abated as a result of the presence of the Arab League mission. Both described Syrians' suffering as \\"unimaginable.\\" Malek's departure was a blow to the mission, already criticized by Syria's opposition as a toothless body that only served to buy President Bashar al-Assad time. Its work has already been hampered by an attack on monitors in the western port of Latakia this week that lightly wounded 11 and prompted the League to delay sending new observers to Syria to join about 165 already there. Another resignation would further undermine its credibility. Asked if he agreed with Malek's characterization of the mission as a failure, the monitor said: \\"It is true, it is true. Even I am trying to leave on Friday. I'm going to Cairo or elsewhere... because the mission is unclear.... It does not serve the citizens. It does not serve anything.\\" \\"The Syrian authorities have exploited the weakness in the performance of the delegation to not respond. There is no real response on the ground.\\" The monitor, speaking by telephone from Syria, asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. \\"The military gear is still present even in the mosques. We asked that military equipment be withdrawn from the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq mosque in Deraa and until today they have not withdrawn.\\" The Arab League monitoring mission began work on December 26. Its task is to verify if Syria is complying with an agreement to halt a crackdown on 10 months of protests against Assad in which the United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed. OPPOSITION ALARMED A U.N. official told the Security Council on Tuesday that Syria had accelerated its killing of protesters after the Arab monitors had arrived. Assad mocked the Arab League in a speech in which he said that it had failed for six decades to promised to take a position in Arab interests. He said he would strike down a revolt he slammed as foreign plot. The choice of a Sudanese general to head the mission had already alarmed opposition activists who say Sudan's own defiance of a war crimes tribunal means the monitors probably will not recommend strong action against Assad. The unnamed monitor said the Syrian authorities had shown little genuine willingness to comply with the plan while the observers lacked the expertise to do their mission justice. \\"There is oppression. There is strong oppression and there is suffering, a lot of suffering, more than you imagine,\\" he said, describing one part of the central city of Homs he had visited. \\"This is a very big problem and it is related firstly to the general will of the Syrian authorities to cooperate with the delegation in a genuine manner and without maneuvering,\\" he said. \\"Secondly, it is related to the expertise of the delegation... It needs experts in the fields of monitoring, of diplomacy, of international law.\\" While an Arab League meeting on Syria said on Sunday it remained committed to the mission, the observer said that individual monitors were thinking of quitting, either fearing for their lives or frustrated at failing to make a difference. Malek said Syrian authorities had not withdrawn their tanks from the streets, but had simply hidden them. \\"The snipers are everywhere shooting at civilians. People are being kidnapped. Prisoners are being tortured and no one has been released,\\" the Algerian former observer said on Al Jazeera. \\"Those who are supposedly freed and shown on TV are actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the streets.\\" Earlier, a posting by Malek on Facebook was taken down, but his words were quoted on the page of Adib Shishakly, a member of the opposition Syrian National Council. \\"Bloodshed in Syria hasn't stopped,\\" Malek reportedly said. \\"Every day, we see bodies in conditions that are unimaginable. Violence is increasing and we are unable to do anything for the victims of snipers, bombardments and assassinations. \\"Kidnapping continues, and torture has exceeded all boundaries. Syria is headed towards destruction and civil war.\\" He said the monitors were \\"ruled by restrictions imposed by their governments,\\" but did not go into details. \\"I am now clearing my conscience to the heroic people of Syria... The truth is gone and the right path is gone. And the sun of the Arabs has set in the alleyways of sad Syria.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the League monitoring mission in Syria could not continue indefinitely. Adnan Khodeir, head of the League's monitoring operations room, said the observers could resume work on Thursday after not going out for two days following the Latakia attack. \\"All the monitors are well, and there are no problems,\\" he said. PROMISES NOT MET Under the Arab peace plan, Syrian authorities were supposed to stop attacking peaceful protests, withdraw troops and tanks from the streets, free detainees and open a political dialogue. The unnamed monitor said those promises had not been met, with the Syrian military still present in cities, even in residential areas, while it was difficult to verify, for instance, if political prisoners had genuinely been released. \\"There are lots of detainees who are not detained officially. Are they with air force security? Are they with military security? Are they with political security?\\" he said. Malek accused Syria of war crimes and torturing prisoners. The Arab League, which suspended Syria in November for failing to halt the crackdown, disputed Malek's account, saying illness had stopped him carrying out his work. The unnamed monitor said Malek may have had contacts with Syrian opposition members, but they had visited Homs together. Monitors had been allowed to visit any area they chose, but Syrian authorities had refused to accompany them in particularly tense neighborhoods, forcing them to make a decision to either stay away or take the risk of going in alone, the monitor said. He arrived in Syria on December 27 and has visited Homs, Damascus and Deraa. The Bab Amr area of Homs was in a particularly dire way, he said. Syria has barred most independent media, making it difficult to verify conflicting accounts of events on the ground. The country says it is facing a wave of terrorism by Islamists and conspirators who are armed and manipulated from abroad and have killed 2,000 members of the security forces. But the monitor said he had seen no evidence of this. \\"We did not feel afraid or threatened while talking to them. In all the areas we went to, we did not meet any gunmen, unless they had hidden their guns,\\" he said. \\"What we found were citizens in their homes who spoke of their suffering.\\" (Additional reporting by Ayman Samir in Cairo and Alistair Lyon and Dominic Evans in Beirut.

A spokesman for the Nigerian military said the attack failed. Acting President Goodluck Jonathan was approved for the role Tuesday. Article:","completion":"Title: Joint Revolutionary Council Claims Pipeline Attack in Niger Delta; Nigerian Military Disputes Success The Joint Revolutionary Council (JRC), a militant group in the Niger Delta, has claimed responsibility for an attack on a pipeline in the region. In a statement released by the JRC, they announced that one of their units had attacked and \\"exploded\\" the Tura manifold, a crucial component in the pipeline system. However, a spokesman for the Nigerian military has disputed the success of the attack, claiming that it had ultimately failed. The JRC, known for its activities in the Niger Delta region, often carries out such attacks on pipelines and oil infrastructure, which they see as symbols of injustice and exploitation by the Nigerian government and foreign oil corporations. Through these attacks, the JRC aims to disrupt the functioning of the oil industry and bring attention to the plight of the people in the Niger Delta, who have long suffered from the environmental and social consequences of oil exploration and production. Despite the JRC's claims, the Nigerian military has attempted to downplay the impact of the attack, asserting that the explosion at the Tura manifold was unsuccessful. The military's statement on the matter seeks to reassure both domestic and international stakeholders that the security situation remains under control in the oil-rich region, even as reports of increasing militant activities continue to surface. The attack comes as Nigeria's Acting President, Goodluck Jonathan, was approved for the role on Tuesday. As the leader of Nigeria, Jonathan will need to address the ongoing unrest in the Niger Delta and find ways to balance the competing interests of the various stakeholders, such as the local residents, the Nigerian government, and the international oil companies operating in the country. In conclusion, while the JRC has claimed responsibility for the pipeline attack and boasted about the destruction of the Tura manifold, the Nigerian military contends that the attack was unsuccessful. Regardless of the outcome, this incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing instability and unrest in the Niger Delta, a situation that will undoubtedly require the attention and action of the newly appointed Acting President, Goodluck Jonathan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, before doing anything else, they took a few moments to look around carefully so they wouldn't bump into anything or trip and fall. They noticed there were small round tables and chairs scattered around the room, and in the middle of the bar, there was a long counter where a man was standing behind it. This man was the bartender - kind of like a waiter, but he served drinks instead of food.

Solve 205*n - 4653 = -25358 for n.","completion":"The math problem to solve here is an algebraic equation with one unknown variable, n. To find the value of n that makes this equation true, we will isolate the variable n by performing some mathematical operations, as follows: 205 * n - 4653 = -25358 First, let's move the constant term (-4653) to the right side of the equation. This can be done by adding 4653 to both sides of the equation: 205 * n - 4653 + 4653 = -25358 + 4653 205 * n = -20695 Now we have an equation of the form 205 * n = -20695. To isolate the variable n, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is 205: (205 * n) / 205 = -20695 / 205 n = -101 Thus, the solution to the math problem 205 * n - 4653 = -25358 for n is n = -101."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy at all for Paul Keller's plight and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little.

Information: - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas. - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the Armenian diaspora communities around the world. As a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries.

Summarize this article: Photos from a homeless advocate show the injuries of George Grayson, 37, one of many St. Petersburg homeless men who said they were paid 25 to 50 to be beaten by women for a fetish site. A lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction to stop the beatings, saying the men were vulnerable and desperate for money. ST. PETERSBURG — It sounded like a good idea to George Grayson: Get 50 for submitting to a 12-minute videotaped beating by an attractive female. A homeless man, Grayson needed the money. So he followed the recruiters to a St. Petersburg townhouse on seven different occasions over the last few months, he said, and let five different women use his body and face as a punching bag. Grayson, 37, became one of many St. Petersburg homeless men allegedly targeted by recruiters from Shefights.net, a locally operated website that sells for as much as 900 videos of scantily clad or semi-nude women beating up men, according to a lawsuit. \\"I'm still in a little bit of pain from a couple of weeks ago,\\" Grayson said last week. \\"I'm just trying to deal with it mentally right now.\\" Local homeless advocate G.W. Rolle said for months he noticed men walking around Williams Park with black eyes, split lips and limps before he finally got someone to tell him about the \\"beatdowns,\\" as they have come to be known among the homeless. He began interviewing and photographing several men with similar stories and injuries, and attorneys representing two of the men have filed a lawsuit against Jeff Williams of Shefights.net, J.P. Florida Productions, \\"Cindy Doe\\" and \\"Jane Does 1-5.\\" Southern Legal Counsel, which has represented St. Petersburg's homeless in the past, filed the suit seeking an injunction to stop the beatings, saying the men were vulnerable and desperate for money. It also seeks damages for medical costs and emotional distress. \\"I was shocked when I found out what was really going on,\\" Rolle said. \\"It's incredible what people will do to each other.\\" Williams, of Shefights.net, said Rolle coaxed and bought the testimony of Grayson and 20-year-old Kyle Shaw, the two plaintiffs in the suit. He said he plans to countersue, claiming the men and their advocates lied and have damaged his reputation. \\"These men are crack addicts and will say anything for money,\\" Williams said. He said Grayson and Shaw were featured in some of the videos, but he said they signed liability releases and knew what they were doing. \\"They've come back many times, which makes it pretty consensual,\\" Williams said. Citing the case, he declined to speak about the videos or other specifics. The homepage of the Shefight.net site features women in sports bras punching or kneeing doubled-over men. It reads, \\"We offer semi-competitive and competitive wrestling, MMA, and kickboxing sessions, as well as beatdowns (which we really love!). We also make custom videos to your specifications. We are located in Saint Petersburg, FL.\\" Previews of the videos describe scenarios such as, \\"This is the second part of Julie's domination beatdown of Army Guy. In this final part, she whips her biggest admirer with a crop, tramples him, puts him in bondage, spits on him, and totally humiliates and dominates him while also displaying her usual array of kicks and punches. This is a Julie very few have seen before.\\" In some of the featured clips, the women are topless. The site offers custom videos, made for the buyer's specifications, starting at 600. Rolle digitally recorded hours of homeless men describing similar experiences of being recruited on the street and taken to a townhouse on First Avenue S between 16th and 17th streets. Some described the beatings happening in a garage, some say they were beaten in a back yard in front of spectators. The men say they were offered 25 to be whipped and 50 to be beaten by the women. They were not allowed to fight back, they say, and did not get paid if they quit before the 12 minutes expired. The lawsuit filed against Shefights.net alleges that Shaw suffered broken ribs, a dislocated jaw, back injuries and a dislocated arm on two different visits to 73 16th St. S. Grayson, the suit says, sustained bruises and multiple lacerations. Jail records show Shaw in the past has been charged with theft, criminal mischief and simple battery. Grayson has been charged with burglary, robbery and dealing in stolen property. Williams, 58, of Shefights.net, has no criminal record. Many homeless people have criminal records, Rolle said. But they also have mental disorders and health problems, which is why they should not be beaten in a garage with no regulation or medical supervision, he said. The two men listed in the suit are too easily coaxed into doing the wrong thing, he said. Grayson has autistic tendencies and has a hard time following logic, he said, and Shaw has an extremely low IQ. Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report.

PETERSBURG — A local website hawking videos of half-naked women pummeling homeless men has caught the attention of St. Petersburg police. Police say they are investigating Shefights.net to see if those arranging, filming and selling the fights — and paying the homeless to be assaulted — are doing anything illegal. \\"Anything involving bodily harm to someone invites scrutiny to see if any laws have been broken,\\" said police spokesman Mike Puetz. The investigation has been going on for months. The St. Petersburg Times on Tuesday published a story about a lawsuit that has been filed against Shefights.net. The Southern Legal Counsel filed the suit on behalf of two homeless men who appeared in videos. The suit alleges that the organizers recruited and paid homeless men to be tied and beaten on camera by women dressed in skimpy athletic tops and bottoms — or in the more expensive videos, even less clothing than that. The men said they were paid 25 to be whipped and 50 to be beaten. They could not fight back and had to sign releases, they said. The suit seeks damages and a court order to stop the fights. Neil Chonin, director of litigation for the Southern Legal Counsel, said the website is another in a series of setbacks suffered by the city's homeless. In 2007, the city came under fire for slashing homeless tents. Last year the City Council banned panhandling on street corners. \\"All around the county, but particularly in St. Petersburg, they get trespassed, they get their property taken — in my mind, it's a further extension of how homeless people are being exploited,\\" Chonin said. \\"Nobody cares about them. According to the suit, 20-year-old Kyle Shaw was homeless when he agreed in January to let a woman beat him for 12 minutes for 50. He did it again in February. Both times, he said, his hands were bound. Shaw said he suffered broken ribs, a dislocated arm and a dislocated jaw. He said he didn't know the video of his assault would be sold online and in one case he wasn't even paid. Another homeless man, 37-year-old George Grayson, alleged in the suit that he was offered the same deal: 12 minutes of violence for 50. Grayson, who has Asperger's syndrome, said he was desperate for money. Homeless advocates fear the website is exploiting the most vulnerable — mentally, physically and economically. \\"(They've) found people who were so vulnerable that the act of making this decision was compromised by a disability,\\" said National Coalition for the Homeless executive director Neil Donovan. \\"That's pretty sick.\\" The civil suit was filed against Jeff Williams of Shefights.net, J.P. Florida Productions, \\"Cindy Doe\\" and \\"Jane Does 1-5.\\" Williams told the Times that he plans to countersue. A message on Shefights.net said media accounts of the website are inaccurate. \\"We won't be intimidated,\\" the message said, \\"and these allegations against us will be disproved.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"A lawsuit has been filed against Shefights.net, a fetish website that allegedly paid homeless men in St. Petersburg, Florida, between 25 to 50 to be beaten by women.

When baking, by what primary means does the heat reach the food? Convection, conduction, or radiation?","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the primary means of heat transfer in baking: convection, conduction, and radiation, and analyze which one is most prevalent. 1. Convection: This heat transfer method occurs when a fluid (in this case, air) moves around and carries thermal energy from the heat source to the food. In baking, hot air circulates around the food, and this plays a significant role in the cooking process, especially in convection ovens. 2. Conduction: This involves heat transfer through direct contact. In baking, conduction happens when the heat from the hot surface of the baking pan, for example, is transferred to the food touching it. 3. Radiation: This heat transfer occurs through electromagnetic waves, primarily infrared radiation. In baking, the food absorbs radiant heat from the oven's walls and heating elements. After considering these methods, it's clear that the primary means of heat transfer in baking is convection. Convection allows the heat to be distributed more evenly and efficiently, leading to faster and more uniform cooking. Moreover, in convection ovens, the presence of a fan helps to circulate the hot air around the food, further enhancing the convection process. Conduction and radiation also play a role, but convection is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in baking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now a new Channel 4 series takes viewers behind the scenes, meeting the auctioneers who would sell their own grandmother - and the customers so desperate for a bargain they'd probably buy her. Every week, valuer Andrew Mackay gets on his push-bike to visit some of west London's wealthiest homes. One lady had paid £30,000 for two corner sofas, he recalls. Andrew Mackay heading off to do a valuation. She got bored with them after six months, put them into storage costing £1,000 a month for three years - by which time they'd cost her £66,000 - and was delighted when they fetched £1,500 each at auction. 'We're lucky here because the vendors aren't selling because they're skint. We get lots of celebrities... They don't want to sell on eBay or have strangers coming to their house - this is a lot more anonymous.' Andrew points to a nondescript leather armchair and footstool.

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name. - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. - The Blue Carpet is a piece of Public Art in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, designed by Thomas Heatherwick.

Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century. - Charles William Mitchell ( 1854 -- 1903 ) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle . A contemporary of John William Waterhouse , his work is similar in many ways . His one famous piece was Hypatia , shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the Charles Kingsley serialized novel Hypatia or New Foes with an Old Face . This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery . - The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is a department of the United Kingdom government, with responsibility for culture and sport in England, and some aspects of the media throughout the whole UK, such as broadcasting and internet. - The Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, is located on New Bridge Street. The gallery was designed in the Baroque style with Art Nouveau elements by architects Cackett and Burns Dick and is now a Grade II listed building.

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819 23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist. He is particularly associated with Christian socialism, the working men's college, and forming labour cooperatives that failed but led to the working reforms of the progressive era. He was a friend and correspondent with Charles Darwin. - The Working Men's College (or WMC), is among the earliest adult education institutions established in the United Kingdom, and Europe's oldest extant centre for adult education. Founded by Christian Socialists, at its inception it was at the forefront of liberal education philosophy. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general.

Here are the choices: - metabolism - enzyme respiration - peristaltic hydrolysis - enzymatic hydrolysis Now, I will examine each choice individually: 1. Metabolism: This is a broad term that refers to the chemical processes that occur within a living organism to maintain life. While metabolism includes processes that release fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids, it is not specific enough for this question. 2. Enzyme respiration: This term is not widely used in the context of releasing fatty acids and other components. Respiration generally refers to the process of exchanging gases, like oxygen and carbon dioxide, in living organisms. 3. Peristaltic hydrolysis: Peristalsis is the process of muscle contractions that help move food through the digestive system. Although peristalsis aids in digestion, it does not directly release fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids. 4. Enzymatic hydrolysis: This is the process through which enzymes break down complex molecules, such as fats and phospholipids, into simpler substances like fatty acids. This choice is the most specific and relevant to the release of fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory.

And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

This prolonged absence of Christ resulted in the feeling that He had left the world, and their religion became a sadder one, especially for those who were most holy and longed for His return."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

California Penal Code Section 261.5 defines statutory rape as sexual intercourse involving a minor under the age of 18 and an adult who is not more than three years older or three years younger than the minor. Statutory rape is a \\"wobbler\\" offense, which means that it can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the age difference between the individuals and the circumstances of the case. Here are some key points and legal provisions regarding the age of consent in California: 1. Close-in-age exemption (also known as a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" law): California's age of consent law allows for a close-in-age exemption in cases where the younger individual is at least 16 years old and the older individual is no more than three years older or younger than the minor. In such situations, consensual sexual activity between the two individuals is not considered statutory rape. However, if the age difference is greater than three years, the law may apply, and charges can be filed. 2. Age of consent in same-sex relationships: The age of consent laws in California apply equally to same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. Both heterosexual and homosexual relationships are subject to the same age of consent and statutory rape provisions. 3. Emancipated minors: In some situations, a juvenile under the age of 18 may be legally emancipated, which means they are treated as an adult under certain circumstances. However, emancipation does not affect the age of consent laws. Even if a minor is emancipated, they must still be 18 years old to legally consent to sexual activity in California. 4. Marriage exemption: California law also allows for a marriage exemption to statutory rape charges. If the individuals in question are legally married to each other, they may engage in consensual sexual activity even if one of them is under the age of 18. 5. Mandatory reporting: Under California law, professionals such as doctors, teachers, and therapists who suspect that a minor is involved in underage sexual activity are obligated to report this information to the appropriate authorities. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences for the reporting party. As with any legal matter, it is essential to remember that the age of consent and statutory rape laws are impacted by numerous factors, including the specific facts of a situation and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. If you have questions or concerns about the age of consent laws in California, it is essential to consult with a knowledgeable attorney who can provide guidance and assistance tailored to your particular situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No snow, everything frozen stiff, grey and uninviting. Show me some nice sunny views! Linda: Tanya: How wonderful! This being... Linda: The area is called Riviera Maya. It has fantastic beaches, as you can see, but no easily accessible coral reefs. We've done some snorkeling though, just in front of our hotel's beach that has an artificial reef. Not bad at all! Tanya: What the hell is an artificial reef?! Linda: Rows of clay half-round structures, open at the top. After some time they become so overgrown that they nearly look natural. Fish don't seem to mind. Linda: Linda: Not very best these photos but you can see what I mean. Water temperatures are 24-26 C, so perfect for us to swim. There are also natural coral reefs along the coast here. We can even see them - Arrecife de Puerto Morelos - but they are either nature reserve or you have to be taken there by boat.

Linda: Even if I go for a walk alone, he becomes fidgety after 20 mins.

Tanya: Don't make too many sacrifices. Linda: Tanya: A paradise as artificial as those coral reefs. Linda: Spot on! Being here you just switch off any critical thinking about environment, social justice, all that crap. More food wasted here in one day that people eat in some neighbouring village in a week. Kilograms of foodstuffs used solely as decoration. Hectolitres of water pumped through enormous swimming pools... Tanya: Heated, I presume. Linda: Oh no!

Linda talks about snorkeling in an artificial reef created by clay structures near their hotel's beach.

Now share your opinion. The hard work starts here for Mauricio Pochettino. Firing Tottenham into the Champions League positions next season will be no mean feat. But truth be told, the Argentine has already overcome a sizeable task in becoming Daniel Levy's latest managerial acquisition. The potential appointment of Ajax manager Frank de Boer was the prospect that really got Tottenham supporters' mouths watering. When the Dutchman publicly revealed. Tottenham's interest in him last month, it seemed the start of the road. towards De Boer's appointment. In fact, it was the beginning of the end of his chances of replacing Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. Dawn of a new era? Mauricio Pochettino has signed a five-year-deal to become Tottenham manager. In the dugout: Pochettino resigned from Southampton on Tuesday to join the White Hart Lane outfit. Second best: Ajax manager Frank de Boer was also in the running for the Tottenham job. Levy insists on private club business staying private, particularly when it concerns something as delicate as a managerial appointment. De Boer's decision to go public with Spurs' interest riled certain figures at White Hart Lane, and, ironically, worked in Pochettino's favour. As Sportsmail revealed, Carlo Ancelotti was always Levy's dream managerial choice. But the chances of luring the Italian away from Real Madrid looked remote at best. Overlooked: De Boer's public talk of the Spurs job, irked the board who wanted it to remain confidential. Decision maker: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has appointed three Tottenham managers since December. With that in mind, Levy made his move for Pochettino. Work towards the South American's appointment has been ongoing behind the scenes for over a fortnight. Fears over Pochettino's grasp of English were soon allayed as Spurs chiefs discovered, despite his decision to use an interpreter for his press duties, that he communicates freely and confidently in English. As a result, he will be expected to conduct his public speaking in English, without the use of an interpreter. But just as Tottenham were laying the groundwork for the arrival of Pochettino, Southampton were just as busy; attempting to keep their highly-rated boss at St Mary's. The offer of a new three-year contract and the promise of a healthy transfer kitty were made, providing Pochettino with somewhat of a dilemma. But in his heart-of-hearts Pochettino's mind was made up; a chance of moving to a club the size of Tottenham does not come around often. Even last week, however, when Pochettino looked nailed on to replace Sherwood, things could easily have turned out differently. It is understood further contact between Tottenham and De Boer took place at the start of last week as decision time loomed for Levy and Co. Deposed: Tim Sherwood was sacked as Spurs boss in May despite signing an 18-month contract in December. Winning smile: Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti was Levy's dream candidate for the Tottenham hotseat. Going into the weekend it was virtually neck-and-neck between Pochettino and De Boer. 'Pochettino has a 51 percent chance, De Boer 49,' said one source. And when Real Madrid lifted their 10th European crown in Lisbon on Saturday night, thus ending any hope of luring Ancelotti back to the capital, Levy knew it was time. Pochettino or De Boer? The former Espanyol manager's five-year deal at White Hart Lane seems a strong commitment given Levy's penchant for hiring and firing. Familiar face: Pochettino could raid former club Southampton for striker Jay Rodriguez. And it's hiring and firing that will take up much of Pochettino's time between now and the start of the season. He will be given a healthy transfer budget to strengthen the Spurs squad, with Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez among the early contenders to follow him from St Mary's. But last summer's splurge on over £100million worth of talent will mean there is not another blow out. Pochettino will be expected to coax the best out of his star-studded squad; in particular £30million misfit Erik Lamela. Last hurrah? Emmanuel Adebayor (right) could be leaving Tottenham following Pochettino's appointment. The Argentine will look to supplement his transfer budget by offloading a clutch of players: Emmanuel Adebayor, who is a target for Monaco, Roberto Soldado and Michael Dawson are among those who could go. Similarly, Pochettino will seek talks with unsettled duo Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris, who are both keen on moves to Champions League club's this summer. It's already been a busy summer for Pochettino; and it's about to get busier. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"- Mauricio Pochettino appointed as Tottenham manager with a five-year-deal - English language concerns dispelled as Spurs chiefs discover Pochettino speaks English confidently - Pochettino will be given a healthy transfer budget and may target Southampton player Jay Rodriguez - Tottenham may offload players like Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado, and Michael Dawson - A busy summer ahead for Pochettino as he focuses on transfers and preparing Spurs for next season's Champions League"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kennedy’s killer was moved to a new prison in California on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Kennedy’s brother, President John F. Kennedy. Sirhan Sirhan, 69, was transferred Friday from the Corcoran prison in central California to the Richard J. Donovan prison in San Diego, more than 250 miles south. The move was routine, said Deborah Hoffman, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. “This transfer had been planned, and the date of the move is simply an unfortunate coincidence.

Kennedy on June 5, 1968, as he was leaving the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The senator had claimed victory in California’s Democratic presidential primary just moments earlier. Sirhan was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to life in prison in 1972. He has since spent time in several California prisons. Sirhan was denied parole in 2011 at a hearing where he said he had no memory of shooting Kennedy. His lawyers have claimed that Sirhan was framed in a conspiracy.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.

In the case of Vatero, it is a part of the larger city of Kozani, functioning as a distinct area, with its own population of approximately 1,100 people. Villages like Vatero contribute to the cultural and social fabric of the region and the country as a whole. They often possess their own unique local customs, traditions, and practices that distinguish them from other communities in the area. Additionally, villages like Vatero are vital elements in understanding the historical background and development of the broader region, in this case, the city of Kozani, the West Macedonia region, and Greece as a whole. The relationship between Vatero and the concept of a village is evident in its function as a smaller, distinct community within the larger city of Kozani. The term \\"village\\" is a way to categorize and understand the structure and significance of Vatero within the broader social, cultural, and historical context of the region it belongs to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Try holding the baby in your arms and slowly swinging the baby back and forth, or holding the baby securely while walking around with a bouncy step, or rocking in a rocking chair. If the baby won't go to sleep, gently lift the baby up and lay the baby in its crib. Never leave a baby in its crib on its back with its bottle in its hands because the baby could choke. After the baby is asleep, sit in the baby's room with it and wait to make sure the baby will stay asleep, and that the baby's sleep environment is safe -- Make sure there is nothing that the baby could play within the crib. It could distract the baby and it won't want to go to sleep. Also, soft toys should never be in a crib, because a baby could suffocate. Keep big, fluffy blankets or pillows out of the crib. Babies don't really need them and they are actually dangerous. Keep bed covers away from baby's face. Do not lie a baby on its tummy, ever, even if the parent tells you too. Always place it on its back. Placing it on its tummy is very dangerous, and potentially fatal. (If the baby is old enough to flip itself over on its tummy by itself, though, it's okay if he flips himself over). Keep checking on the baby as it sleeps. This is very important as it is your babysitting duty to make sure that the baby is safe, is not fussing, is not too hot or cold and does not have a dirty diaper. Baby monitoring is fine if the parents are fine with it, if they don't have a baby monitor, or grant you permission to use them, check on them every 15 minutes. Summary:","completion":"Babies are all different and need gentle rocking to help them sleep. Make sure the baby is safe in its crib, with no toys or soft things that could be dangerous. Always lay a baby on its back, and check on them while they sleep to make sure they are safe and comfortable.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: be done with Remy B: accept the apology C: be pardoned A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, answer B: accept the apology, best answers the question regarding Jordan's reaction. When Remy realized their mistake, they took responsibility and sincerely apologized to Jordan. While it's not guaranteed that Jordan will accept the apology, considering that the context highlights Remy's remorse and admission of the mistake, it is most likely that Jordan will appreciate the gesture and accept the apology. This would encourage positive communication between them and potentially repair any damage that has been done to their relationship. Answer A: be done with Remy, seems quite negative and does not align well with the context provided as it assumes that Jordan will not accept Remy's apology and choose to end their relationship. Answer C: be pardoned, is not the most accurate choice as it involves forgiving Remy, but the question asks what will happen to Jordan, not Remy.

The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble. Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the night before driving to Iraq. Flights are not permitted into Iraq. Hall is to return to Washington on April 22.

News article: GLOBAL FOOD WASTE NOT, WANT NOT Feeding the 9 Billion: The tragedy of waste By 2075, the United Nations’ mid-range projection for global population growth predicts that human numbers will peak at about 9.5 billion people. This means that there could be an extra three billion mouths to feed by the end of the century, a period in which substantial changes are anticipated in the wealth, calorific intake and dietary preferences of people in developing countries across the world. Such a projection presents mankind with wide-ranging social, economic, environmental and political issues that need to be addressed today to ensure a sustainable future for all. One key issue is how to produce more food in a world of finite resources. Today, we produce about four billion metric tonnes of food per annum. Yet due to poor practices in harvesting, storage and transportation, as well as market and consumer wastage, it is estimated that 30–50% (or 1.2–2 billion tonnes) of all food produced never reaches a human stomach. Furthermore, this figure does not reflect the fact that large amounts of land, energy, fertilisers and water have also been lost in the production of foodstuffs which simply end up as waste. This level of wastage is a tragedy that cannot continue if we are to succeed in the challenge of sustainably meeting our future food demands. Read the Global Food report [PDF, 1MB] Where Food Waste Happens In 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers identified three principal emerging population groups across the world, based on characteristics associated with their current and projected stage of economic development. Fully developed, mature, post-industrial societies, such as those in Europe, characterised by stable or declining populations which are increasing in age. Late-stage developing nations that are currently industrialising rapidly, for example China, which will experience decelerating rates of population growth, coupled with increasing affluence and age profile. Newly developing countries that are beginning to industrialise, primarily in Africa, with high to very high population growth rates (typically doubling or tripling their populations by 2050), and characterised by a predominantly young age profile. Each group over the coming decades will need to address different issues surrounding food production, storage and transportation, as well as consumer expectations, if we are to continue to feed all our people. Third World and Developing Nations In less-developed countries, such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, wastage tends to occur primarily at the farmer-producer end of the supply chain. Inefficient harvesting, inadequate local transportation and poor infrastructure mean that produce is frequently handled inappropriately and stored under unsuitable farm site conditions. Developed Nations In mature, fully developed countries such as the UK, more-efficient farming practices and better transport, storage and processing facilities ensure that a larger proportion of the food produced reaches markets and consumers. However, characteristics associated with modern consumer culture mean produce is often wasted through retail and customer behaviour. Major supermarkets, in meeting consumer expectations, will often reject entire crops of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables at the farm because they do not meet exacting marketing standards for their physical characteristics, such as size and appearance. For example, up to 30% of the UK’s vegetable crop is never harvested as a result of such practices. Globally, retailers generate 1.6 million tonnes of food waste annually in this way. Of the produce that does appear in the supermarket, commonly used sales promotions frequently encourage customers to purchase excessive quantities which, in the case of perishable foodstuffs, inevitably generate wastage in the home. Overall between 30% and 50% of what has been bought in developed countries is thrown away by the purchaser. Better use of our Finite Resources Wasting food means losing not only life-supporting nutrition but also precious resources, including land, water and energy. As a global society therefore, tackling food waste will help contribute towards addressing a number of key resource issues: Effective Land Usage Over the last five decades, improved farming techniques and technologies have helped to significantly increase crop yields along with a 12% expansion of farmed land use. However, with global food production already utilising about 4.9Gha of the 10Gha usable land surface available, a further increase in farming area without impacting unfavourably on what remains of the world’s natural ecosystems appears unlikely. The challenge is that an increase in animal-based production will require greater land and resource requirement, as livestock farming demands extensive land use. One hectare of land can, for example, produce rice or potatoes for 19–22 people per annum. The same area will produce enough lamb or beef for only one or two people. Considerable tensions are likely to emerge, as the need for food competes with demands for ecosystem preservation and biomass production as a renewable energy source. Water Usage Over the past century, fresh water abstraction for human use has increased at more than double the rate of population growth. Currently about 3.8 trillion m3 of water is used by humans per annum. About 70% of this is consumed by the global agriculture sector, and the level of use will continue to rise over the coming decades. Indeed, depending on how food is produced and the validity of forecasts for demographic trends, the demand for water in food production could reach 10–13 trillion m3 annually by mid-century. This is 2.5 to 3.5 times greater than the total human use of fresh water today. Better irrigation can dramatically improve crop yield and about 40% of the world’s food supply is currently derived from irrigated land. However, water used in irrigation is often sourced unsustainably, through boreholes sunk into poorly managed aquifers. In some cases government development programmes and international aid interventions exacerbate this problem. In addition, we continue to use wasteful systems, such as flood or overhead spray, which are difficult to control and lose much of the water to evaporation. Although the drip or trickle irrigation methods are more expensive to install, they can be as much as 33% more efficient in water use as well as being able to carry fertilisers directly to the root. In processing of foods after the agricultural stage, there are large additional uses of water that need to be tackled in a world of growing demand. This is particularly crucial in the case of meat production, where beef uses about 50 times more water than vegetables. In the future, more- effective washing techniques, management procedures, and recycling and purification of water will be needed to reduce wastage. Energy Usage Energy is an essential resource across the entire food production cycle, with estimates showing an average of 7–10 calories of input being required in the production of one calorie of food. This varies dramatically depending on crop, from three calories for plant crops to 35 calories in the production of beef. Since much of this energy comes from the utilisation of fossil fuels, wastage of food potentially contributes to unnecessary global warming as well as inefficient resource utilisation. In the modern industrialised agricultural process – which developing nations are moving towards in order to increase future yields – energy usage in the making and application of agrochemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides represents the single biggest component. Wheat production takes 50% of its energy input for these two items alone. Indeed, on a global scale, fertiliser manufacturing consumes about 3–5% of the world’s annual natural gas supply. With production anticipated to increase by 25% between now and 2030, sustainable energy sourcing will become an increasingly major issue. Energy to power machinery, both on the farm and in the storage and processing facilities, together with the direct use of fuel in field mechanisation and produce transportation, adds to the energy total, which currently represents about 3.1% of annual global energy consumption. Recommendations Rising population combined with improved nutrition standards and shifting dietary preferences will exert pressure for increases in global food supply. Engineers, scientists and agriculturalists have the knowledge, tools and systems that will assist in achieving productivity increases. However, pressure will grow on finite resources of land, energy and water. The potential to provide 60–100% more food by simply eliminating losses, while simultaneously freeing up land, energy and water resources for other uses, is an opportunity that should not be ignored. In order to begin tackling the challenge, the Institution recommends that: 1. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) works with the international engineering community to ensure governments of developed nations put in place programmes that transfer engineering knowledge, design know-how, and suitable technology to newly developing countries. This will help improve produce handling in the harvest, and immediate post-harvest stages of food production. 2. Governments of rapidly developing countries incorporate waste minimisation thinking into the transport infrastructure and storage facilities currently being planned, engineered and built. 3. Governments in developed nations devise and implement policy that changes consumer expectations. These should discourage retailers from wasteful practices that lead to the rejection of food on the basis of cosmetic characteristics, and losses in the home due to excessive purchasing by consumers. Download the IMechE Global Food Report [PDF, 1MB] Read the Press Release on the Global Food: Waste Not, Want Not See all IMechE Reports ||||| As much as half of all the food produced in the world – equivalent to 2bn tonnes – ends up as waste every year, engineers warned in a report published on Thursday. The UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) blames the \\"staggering\\" new figures in its analysis on unnecessarily strict sell-by dates, buy-one-get-one free and Western consumer demand for cosmetically perfect food, along with \\"poor engineering and agricultural practices\\", inadequate infrastructure and poor storage facilities. In the face of United Nations predictions that there could be about an extra 3 billion people to feed by the end of the century and growing pressure on the resources needed to produce food, including land, water and energy, the IMechE is calling for urgent action to tackle this waste. Their report, Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not, found that between 30% and 50% or 1.2-2bn tonnes of food produced around the world never makes it on to a plate. In the UK as much as 30% of vegetable crops are not harvested due to their failure to meet retailers' exacting standards on physical appearance, it says, while up to half of the food that is bought in Europe and the US is thrown away by consumers. And about 550bn cubic metres of water is wasted globally in growing crops that never reach the consumer. Carnivorous diets add extra pressure as it takes 20-50 times the amount of water to produce 1 kilogramme of meat than 1kg of vegetables; the demand for water in food production could reach 10–13 trillion cubic metres a year by 2050. This is 2.5 to 3.5 times greater than the total human use of fresh water today and could lead to more dangerous water shortages around the world, the IMechE says, claiming that there is the potential to provide 60-100% more food by eliminating losses and waste while at the same time freeing up land, energy and water resources. Tim Fox, head of energy and environment at the IMechE, said: \\"The amount of food wasted and lost around the world is staggering. This is food that could be used to feed the world's growing population – as well as those in hunger today. It is also an unnecessary waste of the land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food.\\" In order to prevent further waste, governments, development agencies and organisation like the UN \\"must work together to help change people's mindsets on waste and discourage wasteful practices by farmers, food producers, supermarkets and consumers,\\" the IMechE said. • This article was amended on 10 January 2012 to change the abbreviation IME to IMechE. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A report by the UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) reveals that up to half of the 4 billion metric tonnes of food produced per annum is wasted due to poor practices, strict sell-by dates, consumer preferences for visually perfect food, and inadequate infrastructure.

The IMechE calls for urgent action to address the issue, which is contributing to potential water shortages around the world, suggesting that eliminating waste will provide more food and free up resources such as land, water, and energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He ceases to complete his homework, as he feels that everything seems meaningless. As a result, he is put on academic probation. The next day, George goes up to the school roof and sees Sally (Emma Roberts) smoking. When a teacher comes up, George quickly pulls out a cigarette and takes the blame. Sally meets George to thank him, and though George is at first reluctant to talk to her, he soon warms up to her. On Career Day, George meets a young artist, Dustin and is inspired by his thoughts about life. He brings Sally with him to visit Dustin and it becomes apparent that Dustin likes Sally. Sally invites George to a New Years Eve party. At the party, she dances with her ex, while George gets drunk, puking outside before falling asleep in the alley. Sally finds him there and apologizes. For Valentine's Day, the two go out to dinner and Sally asks him to have sex with her. George, clearly shocked, doesn't answer. After his pause, Sally says they shouldn't as he is her only real friend. He is quiet for the rest of the time they're together and goes home early. He doesn't answer Sally's calls or talk with her at all. Sally instead invites Dustin out and flirts with him. The two of them start going on dates after Dustin kisses her. George doesnt do his English term paper and is brought to the principals office. The principal gives George two choices: expulsion or do every piece of undone homework, about a years worth. At home, George confronts his stepfather about lying about work, and they get into a physical fight. George takes off for Sallys place. She brings him into the hallway, where he kisses her. Sally kisses back but breaks it, revealing Dustin in her apartment. Angry and hurt, George leaves. The next morning, George finds his mother at the park.

Options: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding Explain why a human would choose \\"crowding\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"crowding\\" to answer the question above due to several reasons that are specifically related to the nature of narrow halls in museums and the implications of such a layout on the overall visitor experience. First, narrow halls are spaces with limited width, which directly affects the movement and accessibility of people within that area. When a museum exhibits its artifacts or artworks, visitors will naturally gravitate towards those halls as part of their experience. As more people congregate in the narrow halls, the available space for each person diminishes, leading to a feeling of crowding. In this context, crowding is the perception of physical discomfort due to the reduced personal space, which amplifies as more visitors enter the area. Second, museums are often popular tourist destinations that attract locals and foreigners alike. During peak seasons or special exhibitions, a significant influx of visitors can be expected. When this happens, the narrow halls are even more susceptible to congestion and overcrowding. This may result in longer waiting times to view the displays, limited capacity to appreciate the details, and, possibly, queues to enter the area. Consequently, the overall atmosphere may become somewhat unpleasant and suffocating. Third, crowding can also affect the social interactions and dynamics in the museum. In a crowded narrow hall, visitors may inadvertently bump into each other, cross each other's path, or block each other's view. This could create frustration and tensions among the visitors and could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. Additionally, visitors may feel a stronger need for personal space, consequently limiting the opportunity for meaningful conversations about the exhibits. Lastly, crowded narrow halls can impact the overall satisfaction, engagement, and learning experiences of museum-goers. Having to navigate through a densely packed space can be mentally exhausting and might cause some visitors to feel overwhelmed or anxious. Studies have shown that discomfort and negative feelings associated with crowding can overshadow the potential benefits of visiting a museum, such as learning, aesthetic pleasure, and engaging with history. The other options mentioned - sore feet, amazement, retrospection, and boredom - might also hold true for some visitors in a particular context, but they are less likely to be directly linked to the architectural feature of narrow halls. Sore feet could result from walking around a museum, regardless of the width of the halls, while amazement, retrospection, and boredom are largely determined by personal interest and engagement with the exhibits, rather than the physical dimensions of the space. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"crowding\\" as the answer to the question, as the presence of narrow halls in museums could result in discomfort, reduced personal space, and hindered accessibility owing to the high concentration of visitors in a limited area.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

In geology, igneous refers to rock formed by what effect?","completion":"In geology, the term \\"igneous\\" refers to a type of rock that is formed as a result of the cooling and solidification of molten material, known as magma or lava. This process is referred to as \\"crystallization\\" or \\"solidification,\\" and it is a primary mechanism by which the Earth's crust is generated and modified. Magma is a molten or partially molten rock material that is generated within the Earth's mantle or crust. The process by which magma forms is highly complex and involves many factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the source material. When rocks within the mantle or crust are subjected to extreme conditions, they may begin to melt, giving rise to the formation of magma. Once magma has formed, it may either remain within the Earth's interior or travel upwards towards the surface. The movement of magma can result in various geological events, such as volcanic eruptions or the emplacement of intrusive igneous bodies like plutons, dikes, sills, or laccoliths. Igneous rock can be further classified into two main categories based on its mode of formation: intrusive and extrusive. 1. Intrusive (Plutonic) Igneous Rocks: Intrusive igneous rocks are formed when magma remains within the Earth's crust or slowly cools and solidifies below the surface. The slow cooling process allows for the formation of large, visible mineral crystals, which are characteristic of this type of rock. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, gabbro, and diorite. 2. Extrusive (Volcanic) Igneous Rocks: Extrusive igneous rocks, on the other hand, are formed when magma reaches the Earth's surface and undergoes rapid cooling, either from being erupted as lava flows or fragmented into ash and other pyroclastic material during a volcanic explosion. Due to the rapid cooling, the crystals that form in extrusive rocks are usually much smaller and often microscopic. Examples of extrusive igneous rocks include basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. The composition of different igneous rocks also varies, depending on the chemical components present in the original magma. This can result in the formation of a diverse array of rock types, with different colors, textures, and mineral compositions. In general, igneous rocks are categorized based on their silica content (a compound found in many rock-forming minerals), which plays a significant role in determining their physical and chemical properties. For instance, rocks with high silica content are generally light in color, have high viscosity, and produce highly explosive volcanic eruptions. These are referred to as felsic or acidic rocks, and examples include granite and rhyolite. In contrast, rocks with low silica content tend to be darker in color, have lower viscosity, and typically produce more effusive eruptions. These rocks, known as mafic or basic rocks, include basalt and gabbro. In conclusion, the term \\"igneous\\" in geology refers to rocks formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The environment in which magma cools, along with the chemical composition of the source material, ultimately determines the characteristics of the resulting igneous rock. Understanding the processes behind igneous rock formation is essential for studying the formation and evolution of the Earth's crust and the various geological phenomena associated with it."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Q: Article: If your preschoolers turn up their noses at carrots or celery, a small reward like a sticker for taking even a taste may help get them to eat previously disliked foods, a UK study said. Though it might seem obvious that a reward could encourage young children to eat their vegetables, the idea is actually controversial, researchers wrote in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. That's because some studies have shown that rewards can _ and cause children to lose interest in foods they already liked, said Jane Wardle, a researcher at University College London who worked on the study. Verbal praise, such as \\"Brilliant! You're a great vegetable taster,\\" did not work as well. The study found t hat when parents gave their small children a sticker each time they took a \\"tiny taste\\" of a disliked vegetable, it gradually changed their attitudes. The children were also willing to eat more of the vegetables-either carrots, celery, cucumber, red pepper, cabbage or sugar snap peas-in laboratory taste tests, the study said. Researchers randomly assigned 173 families to one of these groups. In one, parents used stickers to reward their children each time they took a tiny sample of a disliked vegetable. A second group of parents used verbal praise. The third group, where parents used no special vegetable-promoting methods, served as a \\"control\\". Parents in the reward groups offered their children a taste of the \\"target\\" vegetable every day of 12 days, Soon after, children in the sticker group were giving higher ratings to the vegetables-and were willing to eat more in the research lab, going from an average of 5 grams at the start to about 10 grams after the 12-day experience. The turnaround also seemed to last, with preschoolers in the sticker group still willing to eat more of the once disliked vegetable three months later. Why didn't the verbal praise work? Wardle said the parents' words may have seemed \\"insincere\\" to their children. Question: The purpose of writing the passage is _ .

Carthage was Palermo’s major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement Panormos (Πάνορμος) from which the current name is derived, meaning \\"all port\\" due to the shape of its coast. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 B.C. the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the name Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.

Ryan went to the record store and bought an LL Cool J single. The sentence provided indicates that Craig enjoys disco music while Ryan takes pleasure in hip hop music. LL Cool J is a renowned hip hop artist, so his music would appeal more to Ryan, who is a fan of the genre. So, when provided with choices for a follow-up sentence, the statement that Ryan bought an LL Cool J single aligns with the preferences previously mentioned. Choice (a) cannot be correct because Craig's preference is sides towards disco music, not hip hop. Thus, it would be unlikely according to provided background information that Craig would purchase a single from a hip hop artist like LL Cool J. In terms of focusing on consistent character actions and preferences in storytelling, choice (b) makes more sense and helps maintain continuity and coherence in the narrative. By relating the characters' actions to their established likes and dislikes, the story becomes more believable and engaging to the reader. Therefore, the sentence 'Ryan went to the record store and bought an LL Cool J single' is the best continuation of the previous sentence because it adheres to the established fact -namely, Ryan's preference for hip hop music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Kim was not seen in public for nearly six weeks before appearing at an event using a walking stick last month. South Korean intelligence said he had surgery to remove an ankle cyst. Mr Kim's health has been the subject of much rumour in recent years, with some saying he may be suffering from gout or hip problems.

He was accompanied by right-hand man Hwang Pyong-so and other top leaders. Mr Kim missed a key political event in October - the anniversary of his ruling party. But South Korea said it believed he remained in control. South Korean intelligence later said that Mr Kim had developed a cyst on his left ankle in May, pinching a nerve and causing the ankle to swell.

Read More This undated picture released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on May 28, 2013 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, inspecting the August 25 Fishery Station under the Korean People's Army Unit 313. Close North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first appearance without a cane since emerging from a six-week seclusion that prompted speculation about his health and grip on power. Kim clapped his hands and walked alongside hundreds of troops applauding him in photos released today by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, run by the ruling Workers’ Party. He attended a meeting of battalion commanders and political instructors yesterday in Pyongyang, the paper said. “The photo dispels the lingering sense of uncertainty that was associated with the cane,” Yoo Ho Yeol, a professor of North Korea studies at Korea University based at Sejong in South Korea, said by phone. “He’s trying to show he can walk without a problem.” Kim, who returned to the public gaze with the cane in mid-October, exercises dynastic control of the North’s 1.2 million troops and nuclear arms program. He recently ordered the shooting of about 10 senior party officials on charges including graft and watching South Korean soap operas, South Korean lawmaker Shin Kyoung Min said Oct. 29, citing a briefing by the National Intelligence Service in Seoul. Kim, believed to be around 30, had a cyst removed from his right ankle in September or October, according to Lim Dae Sung, a secretary to South Korean lawmaker Lee Cheol Woo, who also attended the intelligence briefing. The leader took power in late 2011 after his father Kim Jong Il died. North Korea has since conducted its third nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket that put a satellite in orbit. The U.S. and South Korea say the launch was a test of ballistic missile technology banned under United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Question with options to choose from: Why is the narrator bullish on La Verne ? Select from the following. - The narrator sees his sister went there . - The narrator sees his parents went there . - The narrator sees his teachers went there . - None of the above choices .","completion":"The narrator is bullish on La Verne because they see their teachers went there. In the given passage, the narrator explicitly mentions that two of the teachers at their school obtained their Bachelor's degrees at La Verne, which implies that the quality of education there is proven to be reliable. Besides the credential of their teachers, the narrator is also considering the cost and duration of the program. While they acknowledge La Verne's higher cost, they also express their inability to stretch their education over a longer period. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the reasons behind the narrator's inclination for La Verne: 1. Teachers' experience: The narrator knows two teachers at their school who successfully acquired their degrees from La Verne. This serves as a credible testimony to the quality of education provided by the institution. In addition, having a personal connection to someone who has attended the university can offer valuable insights and guidance in navigating the educational experience. 2. Reputation: The fact that the narrator initially mentions La Verne and is discussing the cost as a potential drawback could indicate that they are impressed with the school's reputation. They might have heard about its academic excellence, extracurricular programs, or other matters contributing to an outstanding educational experience. 3. Time and cost factors: While the narrator identifies that attending La Verne is more expensive, they emphasize that they cannot afford to draw out their education over a longer duration. It is possible that La Verne offers a more compact or accelerated program compared to the other institutions the narrator is exploring. Additionally, despite the higher cost, La Verne may have other factors that offset the financial burden, like better employment opportunities, scholarships, or financial aid. 4. Other schools' information: The narrator is still waiting for more information from other institutions but has formed an initial preference for La Verne. This could signal that La Verne has already shown them compelling offerings in terms of programs, classes, or support. As they gather further details, they will have a better basis for comparing other schools with La Verne, but for now, La Verne stands out as the most promising option. In conclusion, the primary reason behind the narrator's bullishness on La Verne is the fact that their teachers graduated from that university, which provides them with trust in the quality of education, as well as a personal connection to the institution. Moreover, the factors like time and cost considerations, along with the comparison to other schools, make La Verne an appealing choice for the narrator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up.

Three men have been arrested after a group of students fell ill after taking an illegal hallucinogenic drug they bought on the internet. One of the six men - all aged between 19 and 22 - remains in a critical condition following the incident at a terraced house in Jesmond a suburb of Newcastle. The group of students, some from Newcastle University, were found at 3am early yesterday having taken 2CB, which is similar to ecstasy. Raid: Raid: Police are investigating after six students were rushed to hospital after taking the illegal hallucinogenic drug 2CB. Some eight people were at the house. when officers arrived and neighbours said they heard revellers coming. and going into the early hours. Five people who were treated at the. Royal Victoria Infirmary have now been discharged but a sixth remained. critically ill, Northumbria Police said. Officers have now arrested a third man on suspicion of supplying the drug. The 20-year-old remains in police custody. Last night Northumbria Police said two 23-year-olds had been arrested and bailed pending further inquiries. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Enquiries to establish exactly. what happened continue, with officers warning people about the dangers. of taking any illegal drugs - especially those bought over the. internet.' Newcastle University has circulated a warning about 2CB via an email to students. It appears there may have been a party at. the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at. the elite university. Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant,. said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on. We’ve had a. lot of trouble with noise at night but they are a lovely bunch of lads. when you see them during the day and I hope they’re all right.’ A total of eight people were at the property when officers arrived at about 3am during an apparent party at the house. Another, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t sleep because there was a lot of noise. At around 2am I heard some taxis coming and going. There was a lot of boys’ banter.’ In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs. Mexxy, which is sold as an. alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned. of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba. A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone. An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week. Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs. A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’ 2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe. It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances. On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine. A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains. A. Northumbria police spokesperson said: ‘At this stage police believe. they have taken an hallucinogenic drug called 2CB which at this stage is. believed has been bought over the internet. ‘The exact reason for hospitalisation. is unclear at present and could be due to a suspected overdose or mixing. the drug with another substance, or a bad reaction.’ Neighbours said they had heard revellers coming and going from the house into the early hours. Officers are now warning students and other young people to beware the dangers of illegal drugs - especially those bought over the internet. The relevant course heads at Newcastle University are understood to have been notified. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

Please answer the following question: Question: what is phylum cnidaria I found the following answer on Google: Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rare. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the statement you found on Google does not directly answer the question about what Phylum Cnidaria is. Instead, it talks about the rarity of fossils of certain types of cnidarians. Allow me to provide a comprehensive answer to your question. Phylum Cnidaria is a group of aquatic, mostly marine invertebrate animals that belongs to the kingdom Animalia. This phylum includes over 10,000 diverse species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras. The name \\"Cnidaria\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"cnidos,\\" which means \\"stinging nettle.\\" This is due to the presence of specialized cells called cnidocytes or cnidae, which contain specialized organelles called nematocysts. Nematocysts are used by these animals for capturing prey, defense, and sometimes locomotion. Cnidarians exhibit radial symmetry, meaning their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis. This distinguishes them from bilateral animals like vertebrates and most other invertebrates. They also have a simple body plan that consists of two main cell layers, the outer epidermis and the inner gastrodermis, with a gelatinous mesoglea sandwiched in between. The absence of complex organs is another defining characteristic of this phylum. Cnidarians can be either sessile (attached to a surface and non-moving) or free-floating, and their life cycle consists of two main forms: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. The polyp stage is sessile and usually reproduces asexually through budding, while the medusa stage is free-floating and typically reproduces sexually. In some cnidarians, like corals, the medusa stage may be absent entirely. Phylum Cnidaria can be further classified into four main classes: 1. Class Anthozoa: This class includes sea anemones and corals. These animals are exclusively polyps and generally do not have a medusa stage. They have a relatively large size variation and can be solitary or colonial. 2. Class Scyphozoa: This class comprises the \\"true\\" jellyfish. They have a dominant medusa stage with a reduced polyp stage. Most members of this class have a bell or umbrella-shaped body with long tentacles. 3. Class Hydrozoa: This class contains hydras, fire corals, and other related species. They exhibit a both polyp and medusa stages, but the medusa stage is often reduced or absent. Some hydrozoans, like hydras, are exclusively freshwater species. 4. Class Cubozoa: This class includes the dangerous box jellies or sea wasps. They have a box-shaped medusa with highly complex eyes and tentacles that contain potent venomous nematocysts. In conclusion, Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic invertebrate animals, primarily marine, characterized by radial symmetry, a simple body plan, and the presence of specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes. It includes a wide variety of species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras, and can be further divided into four main classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Hydrozoa, and Cubozoa.

The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Svend Åge Madsen (born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction.

Question: Question: What are people doing when washing hands for a long time? Choices: - thinking - sleeping - use soap - irritation - cleaning dirt off The rationale to choose \\"thinking\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The answer \\"thinking\\" is the most appropriate choice in this scenario, given the context of the question and the options provided. When people wash their hands for an extended period, they might be lost in thought or contemplating various aspects of their lives while engaging in this routine yet essential activity. This prolonged duration could be due to various reasons, such as using handwashing as a way to reflect on their thoughts, manage stress, or take a break from a busy day. While the other choices could be relevant in certain circumstances, they may not necessarily be the most accurate response to this question. Here's a brief analysis of the other choices: - Sleeping: It is unlikely that one can be asleep while washing their hands, as this activity requires alertness and active participation in order to effectively clean one's hands. - Use soap: Although using soap is a crucial aspect of proper handwashing, merely using soap does not necessarily mean that a person is washing their hands for a prolonged duration. Using soap is a part of handwashing, but it does not explain the extended time spent on the activity. - Irritation: While washing hands for a long time might cause irritation to the skin, especially if one uses harsh soaps or scrubbing too hard, it is not a primary reason for people to wash their hands longer than usual. In fact, if one experiences irritation, they would typically avoid washing their hands for an extended period to prevent further discomfort. - Cleaning dirt off: Although the primary purpose of handwashing is to clean dirt and germs from the skin, it is not always the sole reason for a person to wash their hands for a longer time. In general, a thorough handwashing process should take about 20 seconds. If someone is washing their hands for significantly longer than that, it suggests that there might be other reasons in play, such as thinking or reflecting. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"thinking\\" as the answer is based on the understanding that extended handwashing sessions are often indicative of a person being deep in thought or contemplation. Other options, while relevant in certain scenarios, do not provide a comprehensive explanation for the extended handwashing duration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CHCOOH (also written as CHCOH or CHO). When undiluted, it is sometimes called \\"glacial acetic acid\\". Vinegar is roughly 39% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin. - In chemistry, structural theory explains the large variety in chemical compounds in terms of atoms making up molecules, the order in which atoms are put together in molecules and the electrons that hold them together. According to structural theory, from the structural formula of a molecule it is possible to derive physical and spectroscopic data and to predict chemical reactivity. - Hermann Kolbe ( Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe , 27 Sept. 1818 -- 25 Nov. 1884 ) , was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry as Professor at Marburg and Leipzig . Kolbe coined the term synthesis , and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the biologic natural product acetic acid from carbon disulfide , to structural theory via modifications to the idea of \`\` radicals '' and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols , and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts , the Kolbe - Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin , and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis . After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen , Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London ( with Frankland ) , and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the Journal für Praktische Chemie , to be elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and to win the Royal Society of London 's Davy Medal in the year of his death . Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists ( including Zaitsev , Curtius , Beckmann , Graebe , Markovnikov , etc. ) , Kolbe is remembered for editing the Journal for more than a decade , where his rejection of Kekulé 's structure of benzene , va n't Hoff 's theory on the origin of chirality , and von Baeyer 's reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent . Kolbe died of a heart attack in Leipzig at age 68 , six years after the death of his wife , Charlotte . He was survived by four children . - The Parthe is a river in Saxony, Germany, right tributary of the White Elster. Its total length is 60 km. The Parthe originates in northern Saxony, between Colditz and Bad Lausick. It flows northwest through Parthenstein, Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha before entering the city of Leipzig. The Parthe joins the White Elster in northwestern Leipzig. - Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. - Élan vital is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in his 1907 book \\"Creative Evolution\\", in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. \\"Elan vital\\" was translated in the English edition as \\"vital impetus\\", but is usually translated by his detractors as \\"vital force\\". It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness - with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time. - Hermann Kolbe (\\"Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe\\", 27 September 1818 25 November 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry. He was a Professor at Marburg and Leipzig. Kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide, and also contributed to the development of structural theory. This was done via modifications to the idea of \\"radicals\\" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis.

With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Kolbe electrolysis or Kolbe reaction is an organic reaction named after Hermann Kolbe. The Kolbe reaction is formally a decarboxylative dimerisation of two carboxylic acids (or carboxylate ions) The overall general reaction is: - Organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials. Study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated forms. The study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g., natural products, drugs, polymers, etc.) by chemical synthesis, as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules, both in the laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study. - Cellulose acetate is the acetate ester of cellulose. It was first prepared in 1865. Cellulose acetate is used as a film base in photography, as a component in some coatings, and as a frame material for eyeglasses; it is also used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of cigarette filters and playing cards. In photographic film, cellulose acetate replaced nitrate film in the 1950s, being far less flammable and cheaper to produce. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - In silico (literally Latin for \\"in silicon\\", alluding to the mass use of silicon for semiconductor computer chips) is an expression used to mean \\"performed on computer or via computer simulation.\\" The phrase was coined in 1989 as an allusion to the Latin phrases \\"in vivo\\", \\"in vitro\\", and \\"in situ\\", which are commonly used in biology (see also systems biology) and refer to experiments done in living organisms, outside of living organisms, and where they are found in nature, respectively. - Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 520% acetic acid (CHCOOH), water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today. - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is an independent, non-governmental scientific organisation which takes special responsibility for the natural sciences and mathematics, but endeavours to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines. - Vitalism is a discredited scientific hypothesis that \\"living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things\\". Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the \\"vital spark\\", \\"energy\\" or \\"élan vital\\", which some equate with the soul. - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy. - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Leipzig is the largest city in the federal state of Saxony, Germany. With a population of 570,087 inhabitants (1,001,220 residents in the larger urban zone) it is Germany's tenth most populous city. Leipzig is located about southwest of Berlin at the confluence of the White Elster, Pleisse and Parthe rivers at the southern end of the North German Plain.

The kitchen, with its dark corners and mysterious creaking sounds, sent shivers down their spines whenever they had to venture into its realm. The old, worn-out wooden floorboards creaked loudly underfoot, making it impossible to move stealthily even when they wanted to quickly fetch a snack. To add to the uneasiness, the old countertops were stained, and the yellowed, peeling wallpaper whispered sinister secrets to their young, impressionable minds. In contrast, the basement was a haven for the children. Though typically thought of as a dark and scary space, their parents had done a remarkable job of transforming the basement into a warm, inviting play area. Brightly colored rugs and mats cushioned the floor, protecting little knees during playtime. Shelves overflowing with toys, games, and books lined the walls, offering endless entertainment options. There was also a comfortable couch nestled into a cozy nook, perfect for snuggling up with a favorite story or listening to music. Sometimes, the children would have slumber parties in the basement, staying up late, sharing stories, and giggling away their fear of the kitchen above. They would create elaborate forts with cushions and blankets, transforming the space into new worlds and secret hideaways. The basement was also their ultimate safe space when a thunderstorm would roll in, as its thick walls and insulation masked the scary sounds of the wind and rain. Throughout their time in the house, the children continued to share an unspoken agreement: the basement was their magical sanctuary, while the kitchen was a place to be wary of. Even as they grew older, this understanding remained, solidifying a bond between them and their fond childhood memories. Though the kitchen never did become a welcoming space for the children, they always had each other and the comforting embrace of the basement to keep their imaginations alive and their fears at bay. In hindsight, the seemingly exaggerated fear of the kitchen would always serve as a reminder that these young minds craved adventure, escapism, and a place to freely express themselves. The basement provided just that - a canvas for their creativity and a world of possibility. And so, the basement remained the children's favorite place, a retreat from the unsettling atmosphere of the mysterious kitchen, where they could let their imaginations roam, embark on wild adventures together, and cherish the magic of their childhood, one playtime after another."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it's director, it has no where better to go. We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do. Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist. The film is really about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy for real? If Clay has not seen YouTube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people. The rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status.

I wanted to add some color to the bedroom so I chose red pillows over grey pillows because the","completion":"grey ones seemed too dull. I thought the red would create a bold statement and add some energy to the room. Step 1: Assess the current bedroom design and layout Before making any significant changes, I need to consider the existing design elements in the room. What are the current colors of the walls, furniture, and other decor? This will help to ensure that the new red pillows will complement the overall design of the space. Step 2: Choose the right shade of red There are various shades of red, ranging from deep maroon to bright crimson. I will choose a shade that is vibrant but will not overpower the rest of the room. The goal is to add a pop of color, but still maintain a sense of balance. Step 3: Select the right pattern, texture, and size for the red pillows In addition to color, the pattern, texture, and size of the pillows will also play a significant role in their overall impact on the room. I will choose pillows that have a subtle pattern or no pattern at all, as a bold pattern might make them too overwhelming. A subtle texture can add depth without being too distracting. I will also keep in mind the current size of the other pillows in the room, and choose the new red pillows with dimensions that are complementary to maintain a cohesive look. Step 4: Decide on the pillow arrangement How the red pillows are positioned along with other pillows on the bed or furniture can determine the overall effect they have on the room's design. Arranging them with some thought can help achieve the desired outcome. I may place the red pillows in the front and at the center if I want them to be the focal point, or position them more in the background, if I want them to simply add a hint of color. Step 5: Evaluate the result and make adjustments if necessary After placing the new red pillows in the bedroom, I will step back and assess the overall appearance of the room. If the pillows seem to dominate the space too much, I may need to try a different shade, pattern, or positioning. On the other hand, if they blend in nicely and add the desired pop of color, the task is complete. By following these steps, I have successfully added some color to the bedroom using red pillows, creating a more visually appealing and energized space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop.

Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik.

Try to teach water treading as soon as your child is capable of following directions and copying the example you set for them. For most kids, this is usually around 2-5 years old. Since younger kids are more prone to accidental drowning, teaching this skill helps to keep them safe. Rather than jumping right in and treading water, it is better to safely work on land. Start by the different parts of the body (first the arms and then the legs). An ideal place to practice these movements is at a playground. Start by simply breathing with your child. Instruct them to try breathing in for a count of four, and out to a count of four. In time, ask them to try increasing the number to five or six. Maintaining a slow, steady flow of breath helps your child to stay calm and tread water effectively. Make sure your child knows that in order to tread water, they must be in a vertical position with their head above the water. As your child works on breathing and arm movement exercises, make sure they remain upright. If your child is not in a vertical position with their head out of the water, they are technically swimming.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.

Answer:","completion":"ii. comes and leads his song into several people riding on camels. As the scene unfolds, the man starts singing an enchanting melody that appears to be an ancient nomadic tune, passed down through generations. This man, clothed in a traditional desert attire, seems to encapsulate the very essence of the desert's soul. His voice is strong and resonant, a testament to the fortitude of the people who have learned to thrive in this unforgiving landscape. He walks confidently among the camels and their riders, feeling in sync with the rhythm of the song. As he sings, other riders on camels gradually come into view. There's a palpable sense of camaraderie among them, a feeling of shared purpose and brotherhood. Each rider dons unique and colorful attire, a vivid display of the region's cultural diversity. They ride effortlessly, having mastered the art of camel riding from an early age. Mothers, fathers, and children alike all expertly balance atop their camels, a shared expression of joy and satisfaction on their faces. The desert sun beats down on this nomadic scene while the wind carries sand and the melodic tune in equal measure. It's as if the very environment is supportive of their journey, encouraging them to continue exploring the unknown. The riders’ jovial laughter and the camel's rhythmic grunts harmonize with the man's song, imbuing a sense of belonging to this tribe of desert wanderers. As the group treks further, they exchange stories, tales of their ancestors, and legends about their people's history that have been passed down through oral tradition. The song, thus, becomes a living and breathing account of their collective experience, an ode to their culture and way of life. Clusters of tents and vendors appear on the horizon, signaling the approach of a sprawling desert marketplace. The riders and their singing guide enter the bustling market, teeming with activity and life. The song comes to an end, just as the camels are led to a resting spot near the market. The scene now presents a striking contrast between the harsh desert landscape and the vibrant community that thrives upon it. As the story continues, the riders will once again mount their camels and venture forth, guided by the wisdom of their ancestors and the music they carry through the sands of time. Their tale reminds us that despite the overwhelming odds against them, resilience and unity endure in the face of great adversity, and that the spirit of adventure burns brightly in the hearts of those who dare to explore the world beyond their own lives. It is this genuine connectedness, both to each other and the land around them, that truly sets these desert wanderers apart."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: The drawing room was one of fifty rooms, where was it located? Here are possible answers to this question: - kid's house - studio - large house - house in england - mansion I believe the correct choice is \\"large house\\", here's why: A:","completion":"\\"Large house\\" is certainly a possible answer, but it's important to consider all the options before reaching a conclusion. The drawing room is traditionally a space designed for entertaining guests, and its existence among fifty rooms suggests a sizeable residence. Let's examine each of the alternatives provided: 1. Kid's house: This option is unlikely, as a child's playhouse is usually not as extensive and would not comprise fifty rooms, including a drawing room. 2. Studio: Studios are generally small living spaces, combining the bedroom, living room, and kitchen into a single area. Given the limited nature of a studio, it's improbable for it to consist of fifty rooms and a drawing room. 3. Large house: This is a plausible answer, as many large homes could have numerous rooms, including a drawing room. Large houses could be expected to accommodate multiple rooms for different purposes, catering to the lifestyle and needs of the inhabitants. 4. House in England: While a house in England may indeed have a drawing room, not all English houses are large enough to contain fifty rooms. On the other hand, English stately homes or manors have been known to be quite expansive, making this answer a possible contender as well. 5. Mansion: Mansions are residences renowned for their grandeur and spaciousness, often boasting numerous rooms. It's highly likely that a mansion would have a drawing room among its fifty rooms, making this a feasible answer, too. In conclusion, although \\"large house\\" is a reasonable choice, the correct answer could also be a \\"mansion\\" or a \\"house in England,\\" particularly if referring to a stately home or manor. The presence of a drawing room and fifty rooms in total strongly suggests a grand residence, which is typically consistent with mansions or sizable English homes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What towns are located near the Kilauea, and how does this volcano's activity compare to the volcanoes in Russia? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these two questions are not the same. The first question asks about the towns located near the Kilauea volcano, which is situated in the southeast part of Hawaii's Big Island, and wants to contrast Kilauea's volcanic activity with those located in Europe. Data relevant to European volcanoes, such as Mount Etna in Italy or Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, will respond to this question. In contrast, the second question wants to compare the same Hawaiian volcano, Kilauea, with those in Russia, not Europe. Volcanoes to be taken into account here would include those situated on the Kamchatka Peninsula, like Klyuchevskaya Sopka, or perhaps even those in the Kuril Islands. Each question involves distinct geographical areas and different sets of volcanoes, and hence they need divergent types of data and analyses. While the first part of both questions, relating to towns near Kilauea, can be analogously answered, the comparative sections of the questions require unique information contingent on the specific regions indicated - Europe or Russia. To speak of the towns near Kilauea, those located within a rather close distance include Volcano, Pahala, and Mountain View. Moreover, the largest nearby city is Hilo. In terms of volcanic activity, Kilauea is known to be among the most active on Earth. The differences between Kilauea's activity and volcanoes in Europe or Russia would vary. European volcanoes such as Mount Etna or Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull are also notably active; however, their eruptions and behaviors can vary in nature. For instance, Eyjafjallajökull's 2010 eruption generated a significant ash cloud that disrupted air travel but was not marked by the same level of molten lava flow seen in many Kilauea eruptions. On the other hand, Russia's Klyuchevskaya Sopka is also one of the world's most active volcanoes, with frequent eruptions. However, its activity is characterized by towering ash plumes and pyroclastic flows, which differs from Kilauea's relatively consistent and less explosive effusive eruptions, which result in slow-moving lava flows. Thus, while both questions involve a comparison of Kilauea's volcanic activity with other regions, the specific volcanoes, their behaviors, and the contexts involved in those regions differ significantly, which makes the questions distinct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Frenzal Rhomb is an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992, with Jason Whalley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this entire period. In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb released their second album, Not So Tough Now, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TISM, Dave Graney), Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis's) and Frenzal Rhomb. Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals - Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182. In September 1997, their third LP, Meet the Family, was released, which reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first certified gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, \\"Mr Charisma\\" (June), \\"There's Your Dad\\" (September), and \\"Mum Changed the Locks\\" (April 1998). The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother he was going out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer opened the front door. Also in April, Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of Meet the Family contained a bonus disc, Mongrel, that was recorded live on this US leg. In March 1999, they released their next album, A Man's Not a Camel, which was produced by Eddie Ashworth and was supported by a nationwide tour. As from November 2011, it remains Frenzal Rhomb's highest charting album, reaching No. 11. It spawned their highest charting single, \\"You Are Not My Friend\\" (August), which reached No. 49. Allmusic's album reviewer Mike DaRonco felt \\"the first two songs are great in that catchy, playful pop-punk sort of way, but the rest ... fall under the trap of having all their tracks sounding like one big, long song\\". The album also features fan favourites \\"We're Going Out Tonight\\" and \\"Never Had So Much Fun\\".

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Question: \\"What resulted in the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor?\\" Response: \\"The trade and fuel embargo\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Sarah Brightman is to begin training early next year for a £31 million tourist flight to the International Space Station, Moscow has confirmed. Despite the current east-west tension and earlier Russian doubts over whether the British singer should be allowed fly, she is slated to go into orbit in autumn 2015. “She will begin training at Star City in January 2015 and we are all waiting for her,” said Yuri Lonchakov, head of the Russia’s Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. A training plan for Brightman has already been compiled, he said. “I believe her training will be successful,” he added. She will enjoy a ten day stay on the ISS with an expected launch date of 4 October 2015. poll loading Is £31million a rip-off for the trip? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Earlier, Russian space officials had questioned her commitment and suggested she had used her application to become a cosmonaut as a publicity stunt. “It is very likely that the singer made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space Station in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir up interest in her world tour,” said an anonymous Russian source in November 2012. An official also claimed that it would be better to send a professional cosmonaut, griping: “It is not clear how the upcoming three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling around the world, will affect her health.” However, any problems now seemed to have ironed out with the Russians possibly seeing their own propaganda advantage in allowing her to make the trip amid the worst rift in relations with the West since the Cold War. One of Russia’s most experienced cosmonauts will chaperone the star into space. Sergei Volkov - the son of a spaceman - will command her Soyuz TMA-18M mission from Baikanour in Kazakhstan, with the tird place going to Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen. Lonchakov said that the famous singer has already passed a number of medical examinations and tests.

The sum she is paying for the trip remains a commercial secret but sources have suggested it is in the order of £31 million. “It is a large sum of money - it is tens of millions of dollars,” according to Roscosmos manned programmes supervisor Alexei Krasnov. Tom Shelley, the president of US-based Space Adventures Ltd, is on record as saying: “She is absolutely 100 percent committed. She”s putting together her mission plan now.” She will be the first professional singer in space and the eighth tourist. The former wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber said at a Moscow press conference announcing her flight: “This voyage is a product of a dream, my dream. Finally it can be a reality. I am more excited about this than anything I have done in my life to date.” She raised the possibility she might “sing a song from space”. In 1978 with Hot Gossip she sang “I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper”. ||||| British soprano Sarah Brightman will begin training in January for a 2015 visit to the International Space Station, the Russian news agency Tass reported this week. Brightman, 54, launched into the global spotlight in the 1980s with her portrayal of Christine Daae in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" Her 11th solo album, Dreamchaser, was released in 2013. ANALYSIS: Singer Sarah Brightman Headed to Orbit? A long-time space buff, Brightman announced in 2012 that she intended to travel as a \\"spaceflight participant\\" to the station, an orbital research complex that flies about 260 miles above Earth. Virginia-based Space Adventures is arranging the trip, which is estimated to cost about 52 million. Brightman will become the seventh paying tourist to visit the station. The last non-astronaut to make the trip was Cirque du Soleil founder and chief executive Guy Laliberte in September 2009. [The First Space Tourists (A Photo Timeline)] Microsoft co-founder Charles Simonyi is the only tourist to have visited twice. PHOTOS: Epic Aurora Photos From the Space Station With NASA's space shuttles retired, all available seats on Russian Soyuz capsules — currently the only transportation system flying people to the station — have been needed to ferry crewmembers. A seat will become available in 2015 because two station crewmembers will be participating in an experimental year-long flight. Brightman also has booked a suborbital space ride aboard Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, which is undergoing testing in California’s Mojave Desert. Commercial passenger service is expected to begin next year. Waiting in the wings for another Soyuz ride to the station is Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who has an option to fly on the next available seat, most likely in 2017, Space Adventures president Tom Shelley said at a National Space Club Florida Committee meeting in June. ANALYSIS: Singer Sarah Brightman Signs Up for Space Trip NASA is working with three companies to develop commercial space taxis, in hopes of breaking Russia’s monopoly before the end of 2017. Space Adventures has an exclusive agreement with one of the contenders, Boeing, to sell rides to privately paying passengers aboard its CST-100 capsules. Shelley said the price should be less than the current 52 million it costs to ride on a Soyuz.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President). The state's U.S. Senate seats... A:","completion":"The current name of the third-party movement that was able to elect Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998 is the Independence Party of Minnesota. It was formerly known as the Reform Party, but changed its name to better reflect its political platform and goals. The Independence Party has been able to garner significant support in various elections, allowing it to maintain its major-party status in Minnesota. This status grants the party state funding for elections, as long as its candidates consistently receive at least five percent of the vote in statewide elections. The origins of the Independence Party can be traced back to the foundation of the Reform Party, which was established in the 1990s by Texas billionaire Ross Perot as part of his bid for the U.S. presidency. The party experienced some initial success at the national level, but its influence gradually waned over time. In Minnesota, however, the party experienced renewed vigor when Jesse Ventura, a former mayor and professional wrestler, decided to join the movement and ultimately won the 1998 gubernatorial election. His victory brought significant attention to the party and boosted its profile in Minnesota politics. Despite Ventura's success, the Independence Party has struggled in more recent elections to replicate its earlier achievements. Nonetheless, it still manages to exert influence in Minnesota politics and maintains its major-party status. The party's ideology emphasizes political independent thinking, fiscal responsibility, and government reform, and it seeks to provide voters with an alternative to the more established Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and Republican Party. While the Green Party has lost its major-party status in Minnesota, it continues to maintain a large presence in municipal government, particularly in cities such as Minneapolis and Duluth. In these areas, the Green Party competes directly with the DFL for local offices, demonstrating that third-party movements still play an important role in shaping Minnesota's political landscape. Overall, the Independence Party of Minnesota is the current name of the third-party movement that successfully elected Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. Although the party may not have replicated its past successes, it remains an influential force in the state's politics and continues to provide an alternative voice for voters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed? Answer the above question based on the context below: The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed is Shostakovich.

Question: Article: Scientists have searched for many years for a method to tell whether a volcano explosion will be small or large. Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. Mount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today. The scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones. The scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives. Question: The research of the four scientists was based on _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the lava from different explosions in the area\\"?

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift!

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — BY all outward indications, the U.S. Navy Veterans Association was a leader in the charitable community. Founded in 2002 to provide support to Navy veterans in need, the charity recorded astonishing financial success. In its first eight years, it raised around 100 million in charitable contributions, almost all of it through a direct marketing campaign. The organization, headed by Jack L. Nimitz, boasted of 41 state chapters and some 66,000 members. This would be a great story of charitable success, except for the fact that virtually everything about the association turned out to be false: no state chapters, no members, no leader with the name redolent of naval history. Instead, there was one guy: a man calling himself Bobby Thompson who worked from a duplex across the street from the Cuesta-Rey cigar factory in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa. But the money raised was real enough, generated by a series of for-profit telemarketers. The victims, by and large, were unsuspecting small-money donors who received urgent solicitations asking for support for needy naval veterans. Most of the money raised stayed with the fund-raisers, though plenty apparently dripped through to Mr. Thompson and a succession of Republican lawmakers who received generous contributions from the association’s political arm. But little ever made it to the intended beneficiaries. In 2010, the scheme was unwound by two reporters for what is now The Tampa Bay Times, but not before Mr. Thompson had fled the state of Florida. From June 2010, Mr. Thompson was on the run, the search for him hamstrung by the fact that no one had any real idea of who he was. Finally, on April 30, 2012, federal marshals tracked him down in Portland, Ore., finding him with a card to a storage unit containing 981,650 in cash and almost two dozen fake identity cards. Earlier this month in Ohio, where the charity’s registration documents had been filed, the man arrested as Bobby Thompson was convicted on 23 felony counts, including fraud, theft and money laundering. Authorities have identified him as John Donald Cody, a former Army intelligence officer and Harvard Law graduate. Given its sensational facts, the case has drawn more attention than your average matter in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. But the story is worth paying attention to for a more important reason, if we want to prevent more Bobby Thompsons in our future. The most outrageous aspect of the case is that much of what Mr. Cody did was probably legal, or at least not specifically illegal. The principal beneficiaries were always the association’s for-profit fund-raisers. During the trial, one of them, Thomas Berkenbush of Community Support Inc., testified, apparently without fear of legal repercussions, that his company had kept 90 percent of the donations as a fund-raising charge. That, in and of itself, isn’t criminal. The alleged fraud was not that very, very little money ever went to Navy veterans. In fact, the fund-raising explicitly stated that a large portion of donations would go to cover telemarketing and other costs. Mr. Cody ran afoul of the law because he filed registration documents that contained false statements, because he stole the identity of the real Bobby Thompson, and because he pulled money from organizational accounts for his personal use. The irony is that he could have accomplished virtually his entire enrichment scheme without ever violating the law — and others have figured that out. The I.R.S.’s Exempt Organizations Division, which is responsible for supervising the charitable sector, is chronically understaffed. It can’t do much more than process the routine and voluminous reporting of the more than 1.5 million American nonprofits, and keep up with the tens of thousands of applications filed each year to start new charities. State and local authorities are in no better shape. Joel L. Fleishman, a professor of public policy at Duke, estimates that there are fewer than 100 full-time state charity regulators, far too few to exercise any real oversight. In the Navy Veterans case, amazingly, the I.R.S. did undertake one of its rare field audits. And yet, despite the fact that the main office was a trailer, its state offices were empty lots or postal drops, and its board of directors and C.E.O. a total fiction, the I.R.S. in 2008 gave the association a “clean bill of health.” It wasn’t until the two reporters came sniffing — first curious about the political contributions and subsequently intrigued by Mr. Thompson’s obvious dissembling — that the real story began to emerge. When it comes to frauds like these, it is neither the law nor the regulators that are the best line of defense; it will always be the careful application of caveat emptor by potential donors. This isn’t easy: there are approximately 59,000 charities in this country with the word “veterans” in their names. Only a few people can claim the expertise to say which are the best, let alone which are trustworthy. As we enter the annual giving season, donors should look to sources like the GiveWell website to find organizations with a track record of effectiveness. Seeking them out — instead of donating to charities that are first to call or that sound familiar or that we’ve heard are good — is the only way to ensure that money reaches those in need. ||||| Our Top Charities We recommend few charities by design, because we see ourselves as a finder of great giving opportunities rather than a charity evaluator.

If either eye repeatedly displays signs of marijuana abuse, consider seeing your doctor, a psychiatrist, or a trained mental health professional. If bloodshot eyes are a severe symptom of marijuana use, such as feeling or feeling dizzy and moving quickly, then contact your doctor or therapist.; II. Skip the second eye altogether if you suspect the person has been using marijuana. Of course, if your friend shows a glassy, bulging eye, your friend may have marijuana.; III. Red eyes can also be caused by any number of other things, including : Allergies illness (such as a common cold) lack of sleep recent crying irritants in the eyes excessive sun exposure Watch for signs of dizziness.

The correct answer is option III because it acknowledges that red or bloodshot eyes can be caused by various factors, not just marijuana use. Additionally, it provides another possible symptom of marijuana use: dizziness or a lack of coordination. Option I is incorrect because it suggests seeking a doctor or therapist based on bloodshot eyes alone, which can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to marijuana use. It also mentions irrelevant details and confuses terms like severe symptoms and feelings. Option II is incorrect because it suggests skipping the second eye altogether when checking for bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot eyes should be checked in both eyes, and the presence of a single glassy or bulging eye would not necessarily indicate marijuana use.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the album that was not a \\"classic\\" record?, using the article: In an interview with Pitchfork in October 2007, Taylor said there would be an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material, as the band doesn't \\"do things by adding one thing and taking something else away\\". The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track \\"Wrestlers\\" started taking a new direction because the band was \\"wrestling with the idea of making an R. Kelly kind of slick R and B number\\" and ultimately \\"[sounded] more like Randy Newman's \\"Short People\\". He said, \\"if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for the fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record.\\" Taylor said that feelings of happiness and love influenced the album's romantic feel.Goddard considered varying styles and influences a key factor in the band's music. He explained to The Sun that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to \\"unpleasant\\" periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created \\"something more interesting because you have these different voices and not one person dictating\\".Martin told The Georgia Straight that the group are \\"afflicted with something akin to musical attention-deficit disorder\\" and said that the group \\"get bored quite easily [...] with [their] own records at times\\". He elaborated by saying that the group aren't \\"really interested in reproducing the same sound\\" because they don't find it exciting.Taylor stated Hot Chip \\"didn't set out to make something with one mood\\" and that he thought the band's style of \\"jump[ing] all over the place stylistically\\" made sense as a record.

This is the lowest you can go in the world, and will help you know how deep you are when you're mining. Diamond ore is typically found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8. Never, ever dig straight down, as you don't know what is underneath those blocks. You might fall into a dungeon or a pool of lava. Once you hit bedrock, go back up until you're around level 8 and start your mine. Dig a central room about 2 blocks tall, 4 blocks long, and 4 blocks high. Some players like to start the mine around layer 11. This will result in a slightly smaller chance of finding diamonds, but you are less likely to tunnel directly into a lava pit this way. Remember, diamonds usually spawn near lava. It is recommended that you create a chest in the central room of your mine so that you have a place to store excess ore as you build the mine. Dig a corridor 2 blocks high and at least 50 blocks long in each direction. These will be your starting branches. Walk down one of your corridors and start mining to the left and right every six blocks. This will maximize your efficiency the amount of blocks you can see as you mine. Diamonds are one of the rarest things in the game to find, E, and occur in less than 1% of the blocks in the lower levels. Finding diamonds is more of a game of luck than anything else, and patience is the most important thing to have when mining for them. If you are lazy and don't want to do this much work, set off some TNT or craft the Wither. But it's best to go into Survival Mode before setting of any explosives. Also, using explosives can shorten your time mining but you might destroy some valuable ores like gold ores or the diamond ores you came for.(The Wither destroys any blocks in its way.) Summary:","completion":"To efficiently mine for diamonds in Minecraft, first locate a good cave system and descend until reaching bedrock, the lowest point in the game world. Diamond ores are commonly found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8. Avoid digging straight down to prevent falling into dangerous areas. Once bedrock is reached, ascend to around layer 8 (or layer 11 for less risk of encountering lava) and start the mine.

Extend a 2-block high corridor at least 50 blocks long in each direction to begin branch mining. As you progress down each corridor, mine to the left and right every six blocks to increase efficiency and visibility of potential diamond ores. Although diamond ores are rare, constituting less than 1% of blocks in lower levels, patience and perseverance are key for successful mining. An alternative, albeit risky, method involves using TNT or crafting the Wither to access diamond ores, but this may destroy valuable resources.

Process: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was normal movement of tectonic plates happens, how will it affect crust is pushed forward. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the proposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of energy buildup and release in the Earth's crust. Direct Effects: 1. The normal movement of tectonic plates is primarily driven by forces originating from the mantle, such as convection currents. These forces can cause stress and strain to accumulate in the crust, particularly along fault lines. If a perturbation alters the normal tectonic movement, it may lead to an increase or decrease in the rate of stress accumulation, thus affecting the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes. 2. If the perturbation causes the plates to move faster or at different angles than usual, it may change the way the crust is pushed or pulled at plate boundaries. This could directly influence the occurrence of earthquakes by either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of ruptures along fault lines. Indirect Effects: 1. Perturbations in normal tectonic plate movement can affect geological processes such as volcanic activity, which, in turn, can impact the stress field in the Earth's crust. For example, eruptions can release pressure within the Earth, thereby reducing stress along nearby fault lines and potentially altering earthquake patterns in the surrounding regions. 2. Changes in tectonic plate movement can also lead to the formation of new stresses in the crust due to the complex interactions between different parts of the lithosphere. These new stress fields might trigger instabilities along existing or newly-formed fault lines, thereby influencing the occurrence and distribution of earthquakes. 3. Moreover, perturbations in tectonic plate movement can influence other Earth systems, such as climate, sea level, and ocean circulation patterns. These changes may indirectly affect earthquakes through various feedback mechanisms. For instance, changes in sea level can influence the amount of stress on the Earth's crust by altering the weight distribution, which may, in turn, affect the likelihood of earthquakes. Overall, the supposition of a perturbation in normal tectonic plate movement can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of energy buildup and release in the Earth's crust, leading to potential changes in the occurrence, distribution, and magnitude of earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Taylor is no stranger to The Posh, having previously played for the club from 2011 to 2012. Background on Paul Taylor's Career: Born on 4th November 1987 in Liverpool, Paul Taylor began his football career playing for Vauxhall Motors before being signed by Chester City in the summer of 2008. Despite facing some challenges initially, the young striker found his groove and displayed his potential as a forward. In August 2011, he signed with Peterborough United, where he scored 12 goals in 48 appearances. His stint at the club attracted the attention of Ipswich Town, who signed him on a permanent deal in August 2012. Taylor struggled to find his footing with Ipswich Town, only managing 27 appearances and one goal during his two-year spell with the club. He also experienced loan spells at Rotherham United, Crawley Town, and Gillingham before moving on to play for clubs like Bradford City, Doncaster Rovers, and Tranmere Rovers. During his initial time at Peterborough United, Taylor made a significant impact with his goal scoring capability and creativity up front. Unfortunately, inconsistencies and missed opportunities led to Taylor's career experiencing a slow decline over the years.

With an ambitious goal of securing promotion to the Championship, the club is determined to make the 2021-2022 League One season one to remember. Conclusion: Paul Taylor's return to professional football and Peterborough United offers the forward a chance to reignite his career and contribute to the club's promotion ambitions. It remains to be seen how Taylor will fare in League One this season, but his re-signing with Peterborough United is undoubtedly a newsworthy event.

(CNN)A Polish prosecutor on Tuesday asked a regional court in Krakow to consider whether to extradite famed film director Roman Polanski to the United States, where he is wanted for having sex with a minor in the 1970s. \\"Further procedures in this case will be made by the court in Krakow,\\" the regional prosecutor's office in Krakow said in a statement Tuesday. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the court could take several weeks to reach a decision. U.S. officials have repeatedly tried to bring Polanski back to the United States to face sentencing in the decades-old case. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 in California to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13. Polanski was 43 at the time. Tuesday's move by the Krakow prosecutor comes three months after OPTIONS: - CNN authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - California authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Krakow authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Mateusz Martyniuk authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Polanski authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Polish authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Roman Polanski authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Samantha Geimer authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - U.S. authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - United States authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview.","completion":"Tuesday's move by the Krakow prosecutor comes three months after Polish authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. Polanski has been a fugitive from the American justice system since 1978 when he fled the United States prior to his sentencing. After leaving the U.S., Polanski continued working and gained international recognition for his films such as \\"Tess\\" (1979), \\"The Pianist\\" (2002), and \\"Carnage\\" (2011). Despite his success, the warrant for his arrest has cast a shadow over his career and limited his ability to travel and attend award ceremonies and film festivals. The case has sparked a complex legal saga that spans multiple countries and spans over four decades. In 2009, Swiss authorities arrested Polanski on behalf of the United States but ultimately decided against extradition, releasing him from house arrest in 2010. In 2015, Polish courts also rejected a U.S. extradition request, ruling that Polanski had already served sufficient jail time and had undergone rehabilitation. To date, Polanski has successfully evaded extradition to the United States, where he would face sentencing for his unlawful actions towards Samantha Geimer. However, the debate continues over whether Polanski should be extradited to face the American justice system for his decades-old crime or if the time he has already served is sufficient punishment. The decision by the Krakow court on whether to extradite Roman Polanski will be closely watched by both his supporters and detractors around the world. Some argue that his artistic accomplishments should not excuse him from facing the legal consequences of his actions, while others contend that he has already suffered enough consequences in his personal and professional life. As the saga unfolds, this case continues to raise questions about the balance between artistic freedom and the pursuit of justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\".

So much of being a parent is getting past the shock of it all. From the first explosive diaper, to the often-judgmental in-laws, to what feels like the endless inequity of your partner’s contributions, these are the indignities we suffer through as parents of little ones. It’s the reason we rely so heavily on our friendships. Above all else, to safely process shock. As our kids get bigger, so do the shocks. From the first slammed door, to the occasional “I don’t care what you think!”, to the seemingly endless battles over where they’re going, with whom, for how long… Prepare, once again, to be shocked. Imagine your daughter is in 8thgrade. You pick up her cell phone. Maybe you’re just glancing at the battery charge left, or maybe you’re doing a more intentional routine check of her social media. Either way, this is what you see: 8thgrade. This text was brought to my attention because I run a private online support group called Less Stressed Middle School Parents, where moms and dads frequently reach out for advice on a myriad of challenges we face as parents of early adolescents. Posted topics range from disorganized backpacks to bullying, and from provocative clothing choices to painful loss of friendships. The group is there for people at a time when all those elementary parent friendships you formed start to wane a bit as kids move in different directions, and though the majority of members will never meet in real life, they are there to help process some of the most real and complicated issues we face. It is a lovely, safe, and supportive spot to process these things together. The mom who posted this image had the following question: “Need advice…would you or would you not contact the parents of a boy (8th grader) who sends highly inappropriate sexual texts to my daughter? Not the first time nor would it be the last…I have repeatedly asked my daughter to block him, do not respond, etc. This is just ONE of the texts he sent…” Her post received an unprecedented number of comments, and because of that, it seemed to stay at the top of people’s feeds. This meant people were given time and exposure to overcome the initial shock, keep thinking about, and explore new comments and evolving perspectives as they were posted. Helpful parents and other experts touched so many angles on this issue, I asked the original poster (OP) for her permission to write about it here. (Incidentally, I removed the original post from my online support group to protect her identity going forward.) How we processed this as a community: As with most parenting situations that catch us off guard, parents’ emotions ran high, but after a few days became more measured and contemplative. Comments covered many important angles, exploring whether the pervasiveness of pornography influences language and behaviors (yes), the need for better comprehensive sex education (yes please), whether this is harassment or consensual (the group was divided), how our kids’ values may not align with ours (painful but true), how a tween’s interpretation of this message may be very different from an adult’s (flattering, anyone?), implications of the #metoo movement in reporting (whether to, to whom, and how?), the connection between self-esteem and sexuality (this can work both ways), and more. It was fascinating to see people talk it out together and to watch perspectives evolve. As an author, public speaker and educator, I count this group as one of the biggest accomplishments of my job. We have built a supportive and non-judgmental online community that not only includes smart and thoughtful parents, but other authors and professionals who graciously offer their advice based on years of experience and expertise in the field. How some of the experts in the group weighed in: Ana Homayoun, a school consultant and author and of several books including most recently, Social Media Wellness: Helping Tweens and Teens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World, believes “One of the conversations adults need to have with kids around smartphone use is around consent and active refusal. If a young person receives messages that are inappropriate and/or make them feel uncomfortable, he or she should have the agency to say, ‘Stop writing this stuff. This makes me feel uncomfortable. I will block you.’ If a young person has a smartphone, he or she should have agency in this situation, and if not, then that is a conversation as well.” Devorah Heitner, author of Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in their Digital Worldand founder of Raising Digital Natives, says “This is (of course) a totally inappropriate text, but also represents a teachable moment. The sender may really believe the recipient will be flattered and even interested. Clearly the sender needs to be educated about more appropriate ways to flirt and express interest, and about birth control. “For the recipient, blocking the sender might be sensible, or letting him know that this is offensive and should stop. But it isn’t her job to educate him herself, and if this creates an uncomfortable/unsafe school environment for her, than letting the school know is appropriate. She should be supported in taking any or all of these actions.” Laura Tierney, founder of The Social Institute suggests teaching kids to Shut It Down. “Coach through Do’s and encourage your child to shut down any sexually explicit comments or requests for nude photos. You may want to ask them, ‘Let’s say someone asked you for a nude photo of yourself. What are some ways you could shut that person down?’ They can be direct and say, ‘I don’t send private info like that,’ or use humor and send funny nude-related images (like a photo of nude eye shadow colors with a line saying ‘these are the only nudes you’ll ever get from me’) or funny emojis.” Dr. Melisa Holmes, physician and Co-Founder of Girlology, says, “Like most things that have to do with middle schoolers and sex and cell phones – there are lots of pieces to the puzzle: brain development, emerging sexuality, harassment, but then there are the foundational topics of sex education including consent, communication, healthy relationships, self advocacy. Oh, and then there’s the conversation about the language he used. So there is no quick piece of advice. “Helping middle school kids avoid or navigate things like this requires an ongoing dialogue about all of these topics, as well as spending time ‘rehearsing’ communication skills (but don’t tell your tween/teen that’s what you’re doing!). Then when they are faced with something this challenging, they are more prepared to advocate for themselves and respond in a way that works for them (or they’re more comfortable getting help from that trusted adult who has been having these conversations with them all along!).” How I weigh in: In my book, Middle School Makeover: Improving The Way You and Your Child Experience The Middle School Years, I advocate for letting kids solve their own social problems by middle school, unless of course we’re talking about a case of harassment or bullying. I think this is really at the crux of this shocking text. Many parents wondered online, “Is this harassment? If so, does this boy need intervention to ensure he doesn’t continue to cross lines? Or is it a welcomed exchange and merely a young, inexperienced teen saying something dumb?” My take: The mom admits this text is one of many that her daughter and the boy have been exchanging. Whether the daughter doesn’t block him because she’s enjoying the texts or because she’s afraid to say no, remains unknown. If this were my child, I’d put the boy on hold by texting back “This is her mom and I am removing your contact from her phone until she and I have a chance to discuss these texts.” Then, I’d begin a very non-judgmental and honest series of conversations. For me, the question becomes less about punishing the boy, and more about how to open up hard conversations between the mom and daughter about what’s appropriate. In fact, the more the mom punishes the boy or her daughter, the more distracted the daughter will become from what she reallyneeds to learn about sex, relationships, and communication. Often when it comes to young “love” and sexting, what’s really behind it are a teen’s feelings of “Am I the type of person who someone could like this way? Am I pretty? Sexy? Handsome? Worthy?” I understand why anyone at that age would be curious about these things and it would be detrimental to add shame to the mix. That’s why it’s important, despite the shock, to take time responding. My most important take-away from watching this experience unfold online, is that time brings clarity. Shock encourages a fight, flight, or freeze response from us. When I am faced with a highly shocking situation with my own child, I tend to freeze with fear – of making the situation worse, of not considering their point of view, of being tooopen to their point of view, of judgement from other parents, of immediate ramifications, and long-term heart ache. As the parent of a middle schooler, perhaps the better response is none of these. In this situation, what might help is something I call “fostering.” At times like these, I try to imagine my kid is, in fact, not my kid. I imagine I have suddenly been entrusted with a foster child for whom I want the very best outcome, but with whom I have no history and no future. This helps me decide what is best in the moment without the weight of a timeline full of worry. It restores my feelings of control, reserve, and flexibility. (Isn’t it alwayseasier to parent someone else’s kid in your own mind?) I suddenly feel less inflamed and emotional. Then, I can think about what I want to foster within this child. A sense of self-worth. A knowledge of how to communicate well. An ability to self-soothe. A deeper understanding of how respectful relationships should unfold. A strong foundation of practical knowledge about how our bodies work. There is no perfect solution to hard problems. But I know when things get complicated, Ilovea list. So, in the simplest form, I suggest these steps for getting through your moments of shock: 1) Make sure your kid is safe. 2) Shut it down until you can talk to your child over one or a few days. (A kid this age can probably only handle so much drama at once.) 3) Consider the perspective of your support group– and strive to keep a support group that has varying perspectives so you’re not trapped in a thought bubble. 4) Consider if you can or should take steps to involve others who can support other affected kids. 4) Make the decision that best fosters your child without letting your own emotions take over. As parents of middle schoolers, know that more shocks are in store. But you’ve got a game plan, so you’ve got this. And we’ve got your back. ||||| Concerned Mom Leaves Note for Three Teen 'Mean Girls' at Starbucks: 'I Was Crawling Out of My Skin' Courtesy Michelle Icard Courtesy Michelle Icard Michelle Icard, an author and parenting expert, works from home and starts every day at her neighborhood Starbucks.

I don't know that they're going to hear this any other way.'\\" She said she was terrified to hand the girls the note. \\"When I got to the Starbucks, my knees were knocking,\\" she said.

He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group achieved worldwide fame during the 1960s. In 1969, Lennon started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono, and he continued to pursue a solo career following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970. Born John Winston Lennon in Liverpool, he became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Further to his Plastic Ono Band singles such as \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and \\"Instant Karma!\\", Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as \\"Working Class Hero\\", \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\". After moving to New York City in 1971, he never returned to England again. In 1975, he disengaged himself from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release. Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. From 1971 onwards, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. By 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He had 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine?, what is it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship. Question: How does North Korea feel about Donald Trump and Xi Jinping negotiating with each other? Options: - They are wary of any agreements. - They support it completely. - They think it's an internal matter. - not enough information === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"North Korea is likely to be wary of any agreements between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. While there is not enough information to definitively gauge how North Korea feels about the two leaders' negotiations or their stance on specific issues, it is reasonable to assume that they would be cautious. North Korea has long been distrustful of international negotiations, particularly those that involve the United States and China. The North Korean regime sees itself as constantly under threat from external forces, and has been heavily reliant on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs to maintain its perceived security and independence. As a result, North Korea tends to see any negotiations between the U.S. and China, its closest ally, as working against its interests. In recent years, North Korea has criticized China for supporting United Nations sanctions imposed on the regime due to its nuclear and missile activities. North Korea may fear that closer dialogue between the U.S. and China could lead to an even tighter economic and diplomatic squeeze on the country. It is also worth noting that although U.S.-China cooperation may be prioritized by the Trump administration in an attempt to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, North Korea has so far shown little willingness to relinquish its arsenal or participate in multilateral talks over its disarmament. Instead, the regime has consistently pursued a policy of nuclear brinkmanship with the international community. Therefore, it is likely that North Korea is wary of any agreements between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, as they may see such negotiations as a potential threat to their regime stability and security."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

To do that, add 56 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -56 on the right side. 0 + 56 = 14*x - 56 + 56 This simplifies to: 56 = 14*x Step 3: Solve for x Now, you need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 14. 56 ÷ 14 = 14*x ÷ 14 This simplifies to: 4 = x So, the solution to the equation 0 = 14*x - 28 - 28 is x = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The intention was to create a dense aesthetic that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes popular in the era. As Spector explained in 1964, \\"I was looking for a sound, a sound so strong that if the material was not the greatest, the sound would carry the record. It was a case of augmenting, augmenting. It all fitted together like a jigsaw.\\" - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Larry Levine (May 8, 1928 May 8, 2008) was an American audio engineer, known for his cooperation with Phil Spector on the Wall of Sound recording technique. - \`\` Bridge over Troubled Water '' is a song by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel from their fifth studio album , Bridge over Troubled Water ( 1970 ) .

It was the last song recorded for their fifth and final album , but the first fully completed . The song 's instrumentation was recorded in California while the duo 's vocals were cut in New York . Simon felt his partner , Art Garfunkel , should sing the song solo , an invitation Garfunkel initially declined . Session musician Larry Knechtel performs piano on the song , with Joe Osborn playing bass guitar and Hal Blaine closing out the song with drums .

Produced by the duo and Roy Halee, it is famous for its inclusion in the 1967 film \\"The Graduate\\". The song was written by Paul Simon, who pitched it to director Mike Nichols alongside Art Garfunkel after Nichols rejected two other songs intended for the film. The song contains a famous reference to baseball star Joe DiMaggio. - Session musicians, also called studio musicians, are professional instrumental performers who can be hired to play at live performances or in recording sessions. Many session musicians specialize in playing rhythm section instruments such as electric guitar, piano, electric bass, double bass, or drum kit. Some session musicians \\"double\\" on multiple instruments, such as electric bass and double bass or keyboards and guitar, a skill that enables them to play in a wider range of musical styles. Usually such musicians are not permanent members of a musical ensemble with the singers/soloists that they are accompanying and they often do not achieve individual fame in their own right as soloists or bandleaders. However, some backing bands of session musicians have become well known (e.g., The Wrecking Crew). Skills and equipment. The term is applied to performers working in many musical styles, ranging from rock, R&B and soul music to country music. Versatility and excellent technique (having strong rhythmic sense, playing notes and chords correctly, excellent intonation, etc.) are two of the most important skills of session musicians, as they may have to perform songs, tunes and pieces from a range of different styles in a range of different settings, often with little or no rehearsal time or personal practice time. As well,session musicians have an extensive knowledge of musical styles and idioms. - Gospel music is a music genre in Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term \\"Gospel Song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. - \\"The Sound of Silence\\", originally \\"The Sounds of Silence\\", is a song by the American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. The song was written by Paul Simon over a period of several months in 1963 and 1964. A studio audition led to the duo signing a record deal with Columbia Records, and the song was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia Studios in New York City for inclusion on their debut album, \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\\". - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Phillip Harvey \\"Phil\\" Spector (born Harvey Phillip Spector; December 26, 1939) is an American record producer, musician, songwriter, and businessman who developed the Wall of Sound, a music production formula he described as a \\"Wagnerian\\" approach to rock and roll. Spector is considered the first auteur among musical artists for acting not only as a producer, but also the creative director, writing or choosing the material, and masterminding all phases of the recording process. He is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history. - Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer-songwriter and actor. Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote nearly all of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: \\"The Sound of Silence\\", \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", and \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\". - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary.

This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. French production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of September 11. The film segments vary widely in content and quality. Two allude to U.S. complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, depicted in the segment by British director Ken Loach; and in Palestine by U.S.-backed Israelis, shown in the segment from Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two more recall other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan; the Japanese \\"holy war\\" against the west in WW II, by Shohei Imamura). Ironies abound in several stories. Shadows that darken the New York City apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the World Trade towers telescope to the ground in Sean Penn's piece, bringing the man momentary joy. But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. There are poignant moments dotted throughout. Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine, to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage: anger at the way things are, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled in Iran, trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in New York. But they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp, where two men have fallen into a deep well, one killed, the other sustaining a broken leg. This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds. Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist, in order to get the 25 million U. S. reward. He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans, for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute. It is Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (maker of \\"Amores Perros\\") who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment, one that, for the most part, shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes, tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers. The group reach Akkad, where Sargon turns on a machine that dumps oil into the water supply. The oil and water begin to flow through statues into the city, which is then set on fire. contains an answer for the question: Who did Noah's brother train with?, what is it ?

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 7828 = -1161*d - 9587 for d.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, we're going to solve this together. You know how we deal with the balance in teeter-totters, right? We're going to do something similar! We have a math problem: 7828 = -1161*d - 9587. The goal is to find out what 'd' is. First, we're going to get rid of the -9587 on the right side. Just like in the teeter-totter, if we want to balance it, if we do something to one side, we should do the same to the other side. So, we are going to add 9587 to both sides (as -9587 + 9587 equals to 0). After doing that we get: 7828 + 9587 = -1161*d. If we add 7828 and 9587, we have 17415 on the left side. So, our new equation will be: 17415 = -1161*d. Now we're really close! But on the right side, our 'd' is being multiplied by -1161, right? We need to get 'd' alone. So next, we're going to do the opposite of multiplying which is dividing. We will divide each side by -1161. After doing that we get: 17415 / -1161 = d. If we divide 17415 by -1161, we get -15 for 'd'. So, the result is 'd' equals to -15. I hope this makes sense to you! It's like solving a puzzle or playing a balance game. We have to make sure that whatever we do on one side, we also do on the other side to keep things fair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:By our sums the soul singer has now won a major industry gong for every 162 seconds of music he's recorded. That's an intake of 15 prizes in exchange for his one album, its six singles plus appearances on tracks by Naughty Boy and Disclosure. If Sam converts any of his five Brit award nominations later this month, Newsbeat's calculator may explode. \\"Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys,\\" he told the audience in Los Angeles on Sunday night. We suspect he meant \\"mantelpiece\\" when he said \\"heart\\" as he walked off with four trophies - for record of the year, song of the year, best new artist and best pop vocal album. The 22-year-old added: \\"Before I made this record [In the Lonely Hour], I was doing everything to try to get my music heard. I tried to lose weight and... I was making awful music. \\"It was only until I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen. So, thank you, guys, for accepting me to be just me.\\" He may be a humble lad, but it's hard to imagine an awards ceremony without Sam grappling with chunks of metal, perspex and general shiny stuff. Undaunted Newsbeat went in quest of the five awards Sam probably won't win, at least not this year. Ok, so Sam seems like a pretty peace-loving chap. But we fear his schedule may not be able to accommodate international diplomacy until at least 2016. The current holders of the Nobel Peace Prize are Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl educational campaigner who defied the Taliban, along with Indian child rights campaigner Kailash Satyarthi. This is the award given to the best European footballer of the year, voted for by fellow professional players. Cristiano Ronaldo's the current holder, but doesn't Sam look great in Cris's suit? Ok, so this is less of an award and more the most prized tennis trophy on earth. To make it a bit harder for Sam to add this particular bit of bling to his collection, we've set him the challenge of winning the women's singles title. We think that's perfectly fair. The current holder is Petra Kvitova. We suspect she is not worried. Because we fear Sam will make us look silly by winning all of the above, we're making this one *even* harder.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.

He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV... Answer:","completion":"The position held by the man that Bach served as Kappelmeister for was Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. Bach served under Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen as his Kapellmeister, after hoping in vain to become the successor of Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister in Weimar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: While you may not be able to afford to shop at Prada or Louis Vuitton, you can still visit other places that celebrities also frequent. In L.A., locales like the Brentwood Farmers Market and Whole Foods are often frequented by celebrities doing their shopping. Stores usually don’t look kindly on people who loiter without making purchases. Buying something from the store, even if it’s small or inexpensive, will help ensure that you don’t make yourself unwelcome. Press conferences and premiers often run late, so if you arrive in the morning, you may see the celebrity leaving for work. Lingering in the hotel lobby may get you in trouble, so consider having a drink in the hotel bar. Sit so that you can see who comes in and out of the hotel. Don't be disappointed if you don't see the person coming into or leaving the hotel. Many large hotels with a celebrity clientele have back entrances to protect their privacy. If you have attended a concert, ask where the tour vans are located, and try to get in that area. Many bands pack up quickly after the show, but some people may be hanging around and could introduce you. Become a waiter at their favorite restaurant, a bartender at their regular bar, or a personal trainer at their gym. Working an eight hour shift greatly increases the odds you will be there when they are there. Make sure to get a job that lets you interact with the patrons. Jobs like valet parking and coat check, while not particularly exciting, are likely to put you in contact with celebrities dining out or staying in hotels. Always be professional. Most employers at places that celebrities frequent will not look kindly at potential harassment of their famous clientele. It’s fine to start up a chat or even ask for a photograph under the right circumstances, but if you become a nuisance you’re not likely to keep your job. Summary:","completion":"This article suggests various ways to encounter celebrities without spending a fortune on high-end shopping experiences.

Every few days it has minor lava flow eruptions off the coast of Hawaii. People have actually enjoyed swimming in the water above this newly forming volcano because it is very soothing and relaxing. Will the speed of molecules increase or decrease as temperature decreases? Answer:","completion":"When the temperature of a substance decreases, the speed of its molecules typically decreases as well. This is due to the direct relationship between temperature and the kinetic energy of the molecules within a substance. To understand this, it is essential to review the fundamental concepts of molecular movement and temperature. Molecules in a substance are in constant motion, whether in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. This movement is known as molecular kinetic energy. As the temperature of a substance increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also rises. With an increase in kinetic energy, the molecules move more rapidly and collide more frequently with each other. This, in turn, causes the overall energy in the system to increase. In the case of the underwater volcano off the coast of Hawaii, the rising temperature warms the surrounding waters, causing an increase in the speed of their molecules. As people swim in this water, they feel the warmth and find the experience relaxing, perhaps due to the soothing sensation provided by the higher molecular activity in the water. Now, let's consider the opposite scenario. If the temperature of this water were to decrease, the kinetic energy of its molecules would also decline. As a result, the molecules would move more slowly and experience fewer collisions. Essentially, the overall energy of the system would decrease, and the water would feel cooler to the touch. Taking all of these factors into account, we can confidently conclude that the speed of molecules will decrease as temperature decreases. This relationship is consistent across various substances and environmental conditions and is a fundamental principle of physics and chemistry."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. At first, Jill dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who promise to trace the caller if Jill keeps him on the telephone line long enough. Jill, frightened to extreme measures, arms herself as she receives one final call from the nefarious stalker.

Larry researched saprophytic fungi, while Bill researched parasitic fungi. They later exchanged findings. But I can use this background: They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed. What is an answer for this question: Which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Bill researched parasitic fungi while Larry researched saprophytic fungi. Parasitic fungi are those that feed on living hosts and get their nutrients from them. They use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may cause illness in the host. These disease-causing fungi are classified as parasitic and typically engage in a symbiotic relationship with their host, wherein the parasite benefits at the expense of the host. Saprophytic fungi, on the other hand, are organisms that obtain their nutrients from decaying organic matter. These fungi play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling organic material in various ecosystems, as they decompose dead plants, animals, and other organic materials to extract the nutrients they need for their growth. Given that the question asks which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host, the answer would be Larry. Larry focused his research on saprophytic fungi, which do not get their nutrients directly from living hosts but instead feed on dead and decaying organic matter. On the contrary, Bill studied parasitic fungi, which are known to get their nutrients from living hosts and often cause harm or disability as a consequence. Therefore, it can be concluded that Larry learned less about fungi that rely on living hosts for their sustenance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: MINNEAPOLIS (AP/WCCO) — Two Minneapolis rallies to demonstrate against the grand jury’s decision in Ferguson, Missouri, drew several hundred people on Tuesday, with a scary moment when a car struck one protester and then burst through a pack of other protesters when they quickly surrounded it. Police said a woman suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital by ambulance. Footage from a news helicopter appeared to show at least one person being driven over as the car left the scene near the city’s 3rd Precinct police station. The driver called police soon after to report the incident, and police spokesman Scott Seroka said no one was arrested. The rally near the 3rd Precinct and an earlier gathering at the University of Minnesota both drew hundreds of people carrying signs and chanting slogans in an effort to show solidarity with Michael Brown, the black teenager shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson in August. Ferguson erupted in violence Monday night after a grand jury declined to indict the officer. On the steps of the university’s Coffman Union, demonstrators sat down for 4 ½ minutes of silence to mark the 4 ½ hours that Brown’s body reportedly lay in the street after he was shot. Some carried signs that read, “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” and speakers called for an end to racial discrimination. Nivedita Sriram, 18, a freshman from Darien, Illinois, said the grand jury’s decision showed “systematic injustice.” “It’s shown our system is broken,” she said. One of the rally’s organizers, Black Student Union president Michael Ampaabeng, addressed the crowd through a bullhorn: “We believe the family of Michael Brown deserves due process and their day in court.” Later, protesters marched across campus, chanting: “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now” and “If we don’t get it — shut it down.” Just after 7 p.m., Minneapolis Police stopped another driver after he drove his van through protesters who appeared to be blocking his vehicle. Other rallies were planned in St. Paul and Duluth. (TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2014 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.) ||||| The driver who lurched into a south Minneapolis intersection packed with protesters Tuesday was “attempting to flee from the mob” when he ran into and slightly injured a 16-year-old girl as others perched on the hood of his car, police said Wednesday. The driver, Jeffrey Patrick Rice, 40, was questioned moments after he drove through the crowd late Tuesday afternoon on eastbound Lake Street at Minnehaha Avenue S. Police said Wednesday that the case “remains under investigation.” Rice, of St. Paul, was not arrested, and no charges have been filed. His mother said in an interview that Rice was coming home from work and “didn’t even know what was going on” when he encountered the group of several hundred people. The protestors were blocking the intersection as part of a day of demonstrations over Monday’s grand jury decision on the Ferguson, Mo., police shooting. The girl who was run over by the horn-blaring Subaru station wagon was taken by emergency responders to Regions Hospital for minor injuries. Police withheld her identity because she is a juvenile. “The victim’s vehicle was damaged by a large group of people,” said the report released early Wednesday by police. “While [the driver] was attempting to flee from the mob, he struck a pedestrian. State accident report filed.” The Wednesday morning police report listed Rice as a “victim” and the injured girl under a category marked “other.” Later in the day, police changed the listing of Rice to “suspect.” They did not provide additional information or immediately respond to a request for comment. Rice’s driving history in Minnesota includes three drunken driving convictions, with the most recent coming in 2003, according to court records. He’s also been convicted of driving with an open liquor bottle, and driving after his license was canceled and in violation of restrictions placed on his license. The most recent of these convictions came in early 2008. All of Rice’s convictions have been for misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors. His sentences have included fines and probation along with stints either in jail or the workhouse, court records show. State officials said Rice has a valid driver’s license. Rice’s encounter with the demonstrators unfolded within a few steps of the Police Department’s Third Precinct headquarters, and much of it was captured on a Star Tribune video. Additional video from KSTP-TV shows that Rice paused behind a vehicle stopped in front of him, then steered to the right around that vehicle and drove slowly into the crowd blocking the intersection. There were three people on the hood of his car as he knocked down the girl. After the girl fell to the pavement, the crowd erupted in screams. Some people ounded on the windshield and windows while the car was stopped momentarily. Rice then moved forward again, knocking down a few more people, the TV video shows. Gea Ebrahem said she was one of the protesters hit after Rice resumed moving. She said she moved in front of the car to join others who were trying to lift a tire off the teen and pull her to safety. “My head was in front of the bumper,” said Ebrahem, 24. “I ended up at the bottom of everybody.” The people who were on the hood of the car, she continued, “didn’t jump on the car because they wanted to. They got hit, and it was a natural reaction [to get onto the hood].” Despite the momentary mayhem, Ebrahem said, “I just want people to know that the rally was peaceful.” Soon after leaving the intersection, Rice pulled over and called 911, police spokesman John Elder said Wednesday. No one else was hurt, according to police. City officials said Wednesday that organizers did not need a permit to hold their protest, despite concerns about the potential disruptions to traffic. Elder said police were still “actively investigating” the incident before turning the case over to the Hennepin County attorney’s office to decide whether charges are appropriate. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Two Minneapolis rallies protesting the grand jury's decision in the Ferguson case drew several hundred people on Tuesday, including a scary incident where a car struck a protester and then proceeded to burst through a pack of surrounding protesters.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country.

Summarize this article: Practice deep breathing relaxation exercises. Deep breathing expands your diaphragm and triggers a calming response in your body. As part of this response, your blood pressure and cortisol levels will drop. Practice deep breathing by taking in a slow, deep breath so that you fill up your entire lung. As you do so, allow your belly to expand, and then slowly exhale. You can also practice deep breathing while you meditate or practice yoga. Mindfulness is the technique of living in the present moment and taking your focus away from regrets about the past and fears about the future. Mindfulness can be incorporated into every aspect of your daily life. You can practice mindfulness when you are exercising, eating, working, talking, or reading. Mindfulness research has shown that this practice reduces stress by decreasing rumination. Mindfulness also improves memory, focus, and satisfaction in relationships. To practice mindfulness, focus on your senses and let worries or thoughts about obligations float in and then out of your awareness. Do not linger on any one thought. Instead, try to observe them and then let them pass. Practicing yoga religiously changes the chemical patterns in the body and triggers natural relaxation responses by the body. Yoga promotes a state of biochemical relaxation in the body meaning there is ample oxygen available in the body and heart rate and blood pressure are normal. Apart from physical benefits, yoga also helps in the elimination of toxins from the body. Yoga breathing techniques also have a profound impact on both physical and mental well-being. They help clean up our system to restore balance in our thoughts and emotions. Try taking a beginner yoga class at a local yoga studio or buy a DVD to practice yoga in the comfort of your home. Essential oils can have mood enhancing benefits which aid in stress reduction. For relaxation, it helps to inhale scents of lavender, valerian, citrus, geranium, cloves, camphor and poplar for relief from insomnia associated with symptoms of mental breakdown. Peppermint essential oil can provide relief from headaches caused by stress and it can even help with nausea and stomach upset, which is also associated with stress. Mix a few drops of peppermint oil with a carrier oil such as almond oil and rub a small amount onto your temples and forehead. Breathe deeply as your rub in the oil to help you relax. In recent studies, essential oils such as lavender oil and lemon oil have been shown to improve mood.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of deep breathing relaxation exercises, mindfulness, yoga, and essential oils in reducing stress and promoting overall well-being.

He would wake up every morning and look out of the window for anyone standing too close to the edge of the cliff. If he saw someone and thought they might jump, he would simply walk over with a smile and say, \\"Is there something I could do to help you?\\" That sounds very simple, but it worked - Ritchie tried to have a talk with these people and ended up inviting them back to his house for tea or breakfast. In 2006, Ritchie was given the Medal of the Order of Australia for all his saving lives. In 2010, he and his wife were named Woollahra Council's citizens of the year and in 2011, he was given the Local Hero Award for Australia by the National Australia Day Council. In a situation where most would turn a blind eye, Don has taken action. With such simple actions Don has saved a number of lives. Don's story touched the hearts of all Australians and challenged us to rethink what it means to be a good neighbor. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: It's important for him to get these prizes. B: He saved people through giving them money. C: We should rethink how to be a good neighbour. D: He stopped 210 people from killing themselves. The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: We should rethink how to be a good neighbour."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

They discuss their common interest in Henry Miller. Marcy leaves Paul her number and informs him that she lives with a sculptor named Kiki Bridges (Linda Fiorentino), who makes and sells plaster of Paris paperweights resembling cream cheese bagels. Later in the night, under the pretense of buying a paperweight, Paul visits Marcy, taking a cab to her apartment. On his way to visit Marcy, a 20 bill is blown out the window of the cab, leaving him with only some spare pocket change. The cab driver is furious that he cannot pay. This is the first in a long series of misadventures for Paul that turn hostile through no fault of his own. At the apartment Paul meets the sculptor Kiki and Marcy, and comes across a collection of photographs and medications which imply that Marcy is severely disfigured from burns on her legs and torso. As a result of this implication, and as a result of a strained conversation with Marcy, Paul abruptly slips out of the apartment.

June encounters Paul while he is on his way back from Tom's apartment to fetch the cash register keys. She is suspicious of him and questions his intentions. Paul is caught in a series of misadventures throughout the night, resulting in him being chased by an angry mob that believes he is the one responsible for the string of burglaries in the neighborhood. June eventually comes to Paul's rescue. She disguises him as an inanimate artwork and hides him inside Club Berlin, tricking the mob into thinking he'd fled elsewhere. At the end of the film, as dawn breaks, June escorts Paul out of the club and into her van. As they drive away from the scene, June throws the keys for Tom's bar out of the window, and they land in the grate outside the subway station. Paul exits the van and retrieves the keys, finally managing to make his way home, ending his chaotic night in New York City."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: James Earl Jones is great as always. But the plot stumbles after the boat crashes into the dock. The story veers into contrived and, by the end, absurd plot developments (the final scene inexplicably has James Earl Jones walking on water). I think the makers of this movie tried too hard to jam too many liberal dogmas about race relations into one movie. James Earl Jones walked on water, I suppose, because black people are Jesus-like saviors of white people.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready. Question: suppose water surface solidifies in ice tray happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: Less When the water surface in the ice tray solidifies before the rest of the water in the tray has had a chance to freeze, it can potentially lead to less ice cubes being made. Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Ice formation process: Water, when cooled to its freezing point of 0°C (32°F) or below, will change its phase from a liquid to solid (ice). This process typically starts at the surface of the water, where it is in contact with the cold air or surfaces within the freezer. Once the ice starts forming at the surface, a thin layer of ice will cover the surface, acting as an insulating barrier. 2. Insulation effect: The thin layer of ice that forms on the surface of the water will prevent heat transfer from the liquid water below to the cold air in the freezer. Because heat transfer is inhibited, the water trapped below the ice layer will take longer to cool down to its freezing point. 3. Formation of fewer ice cubes: When the water surface in the ice tray solidifies before the rest of the water has a chance to freeze, it essentially forms an ice shield above the remaining liquid water. As this surface ice layer continues to thicken, it becomes more difficult for the water beneath it to freeze, as the layer acts as an increasingly efficient insulator. As a result, the formation of ice cubes beneath the surface layer will be slowed or even halted, thus leading to fewer ice cubes being created. 4. Uneven freezing: In some cases, the sides and dividing walls of the ice tray might also become frozen before the water at the center of each individual cavity. This uneven freezing pattern could also lead to the formation of fewer ice cubes or ice cubes with irregular shapes. So, the correct answer is B: Less. The solidification of the water surface in the ice tray could lead to fewer ice cubes being made. This occurs because the surface ice acts as an insulating barrier, preventing efficient heat transfer between the remaining liquid water and the cold air in the freezer. Consequently, the water beneath the surface layer may take longer to freeze and may not turn into solid ice cubes at all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Would \\"The group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil and Knowles suffered from depression that lasted for a number of years.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No. A more detailed and appropriate answer to the question, \\"When was Beyoncé Knowles discovered?\\" would be: Beyoncé Knowles, the critically acclaimed and highly successful American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer, first gained prominence as a member of the all-girl R&B group, Destiny's Child. Born on September 4, 1981, Knowles was raised in Houston, Texas, where her father, Mathew Knowles, managed her early career in the music industry. Beyoncé's journey to stardom began at an early age when she won a school talent show at the age of 7. However, it was during the early-mid 1990s when her talent was genuinely discovered. In 1990, Beyoncé, along with friends Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, formed the girl group \\"Girl's Tyme,\\" which later evolved into Destiny's Child. The group caught the attention of record producers and was eventually signed to Columbia Records in 1997. Destiny's Child soon garnered immense popularity and success worldwide with their debut self-titled album in 1998, which featured songs like \\"No, No, No.\\" It was followed by their second album, \\"The Writing's on the Wall,\\" in 1999, which included their breakthrough hits \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Bug A Boo,\\" \\"Say My Name\\" and \\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\\". Throughout this time, Beyoncé played a pivotal role in the group's songwriting and emerged as the lead vocalist. Despite facing significant internal conflicts and legal turmoil, which led to multiple lineup changes, Destiny's Child continued to release successful albums such as \\"Survivor\\" (2001) and \\"Destiny Fulfilled\\" (2004). With these albums, the group's fame solidified, and Beyoncé's presence in the music industry grew stronger. Although Beyoncé's initial discovery happened with Destiny's Child, she later found her footing as a solo artist, releasing her first solo album, \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" in 2003. The album instantly became a massive hit, further propelling her career and earning her numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards. So, in conclusion, Beyoncé Knowles was discovered during the early to mid-1990s as a member of the R&B group Destiny's Child. However, it was her various roles in the group and the eventual success of her solo career that ultimately cemented her status as a global icon in the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which student read more about reactant particles being heated? Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous? Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. The answer is:","completion":"Alexander is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous. The given information highlights that Jeremy works on a construction site operating heavy machinery like jackhammers and large welding machines, which produce high decibel levels. These high-decibel sounds are louder, have greater intensity, and are more likely to cause damage to the ears and lead to hearing loss. On the other hand, Alexander works in a library, where he is exposed to much lower decibel levels. Libraries are typically associated with quiet environments and low-intensity sounds. According to the hint provided, every 10-decibel increase in intensity leads to a tenfold increase in loudness. Higher-decibel sounds are dangerous, and thus, Jeremy's workplace poses a greater risk to his hearing than Alexander's workplace.

He has also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks. Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2002-03 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. Yi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was \\"not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience.\\" Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft. Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016. After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time.

Options: A. getting arrested B. throw up C. staggering D. fall down E. explode Answer:","completion":"B. throw up The body can only process a certain amount of alcohol at a time, approximately one standard drink per hour. When you consume alcohol faster than your body can process it, the level of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. High levels of alcohol in the bloodstream can lead to a variety of physical reactions and impairments. One such reaction is nausea and vomiting. When the body senses that it has consumed too much alcohol too quickly, it may respond by activating the vomiting reflex to help rid the body of the excess alcohol.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","completion":"Uskon, että tämä eduskunta venyttää uskottavuutensa rajoja. Kun keskustelemme parlamentin uskottavuudesta, on tärkeää ymmärtää, että se voi heijastua monella tavalla. Uskottavuus on parlamentin kykyä edustaa kansalaisten etuja, tehdä tehokasta päätöksentekoa ja luoda luottamusta äänestäjien keskuudessa. Näitä asioita on syytä tarkastella tarkemmin ja yrittää ymmärtää, miksi uskottavuuden rajat saattavat olla koetuksella. Ensinnäkin, parlamentin edustuksellisen tehtävän osalta voi syntyä uskottavuushaasteita. Tämä voi johtua esimerkiksi siitä, että äänestäjien edustus on epätasaista erilaisten äänestysmenetelmien tai vaalipiirijärjestelmän seurauksena. Näin ollen, jos kansalaisten mielipiteet ja tarpeet eivät tule riittävästi kuulluiksi ja edustetuiksi päätöksenteossa, parlamentti saattaa menettää osan uskottavuudestaan kansalaisten silmissä. Toiseksi, tehokas päätöksenteko on välttämätöntä parlamentin uskottavuuden säilyttämiseksi. Jos päätöksentekoprosessi muuttuu liian hitaaksi, byrokraattiseksi tai osapuolia vallitsevaan poliittiseen peliin osallistuviksi, se voi heikentää äänestäjien luottamusta parlamentin kykyyn tehdä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat kansalaisten etujen mukaisia. Tämän seurauksena äänestäjät saattavat tuntea itsensä etääntyneiksi päätöksenteosta ja kokea, että heidän äänellään ei ole vaikutusta. Kolmanneksi, luottamus on keskeinen tekijä parlamentin uskottavuuden kannalta. Luottamuksen säilyttäminen äänestäjien keskuudessa edellyttää avoimuutta päätöksenteossa, integriteettiä ja vastuuvelvollisuutta. Jos parlamentin toiminta kuitenkin nähdään korruption, nepotismin tai muiden epäeettisten käytäntöjen vallassa olevaksi, luottamuksen rappeutuminen voi johtaa parlamentin uskottavuuden heikkenemiseen. Lopuksi on huomioitava, että parlamentin uskottavuuden säilyttäminen on jatkuva prosessi ja että sen on oltava kestävää. Eduskunnan jäsenten ja toimielinten on oltava tietoisia siitä, että heillä on suuri vastuu edustaa kansalaisten etuja ja olla heidän palveluksessaan. Näin ollen, jos eduskunta kykenee vastaamaan näihin haasteisiin ja panostamaan avoimuuteen, eettisyyteen ja tehokkuuteen, sen mahdollisuudet säilyttää uskottavuutensa äänestäjien keskuudessa saattavat parantua merkittävästi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lesson 1: Ways of creative thinking are needed Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both dropped out of college. They prefer to teach themselves because they like to develop their own ways of thinking. They think standard ways of teaching might stop people from being creative and having new ideas. Lesson 2: The answer might not be what you expect Find your answers from facts -- not start with an expectation of what you will find. Stephen Jacobsen from Northwestern University believed what he was taught: that water on Earth came from icy comets or planets which hit into Earth. However, by studying a special rock, he discovered that it acts like a sponge . This suggests that Earth's water may have come from inside, driven to the surface to form the oceans, by geological activity. \\"I had a pretty hard time making others believe it,\\" he said. \\"But thinking about the fact that you may the first person to see something for the first time doesn't happen very often. When it does, it's amazing.\\" _ Years of planning went into a recent achievement in space travel. The European Space Agency's \\"Philae\\", a robot landing craft, met up with Comet 67P, which is 480 million kilometers away. The trip from Earth by \\"Philae\\" had taken ten years! The scientists had no idea what the surface of the comet would be like. If the landing failed, it would be impossible to get information from the spacecraft. Twenty years of work would have been wasted. When \\"Philae\\" tried to land, it bounced away from the comet's icy surface twice.

Given the following context: As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search. Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope can view.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

Duel is a suspenseful thriller based on a short story by Richard Matheson. The film follows the terrifying journey of a salesman, David Mann, played by actor Dennis Weaver, as he is relentlessly pursued and tormented by a psychotic truck driver on a desolate stretch of highway. The story focuses on the incredible tension and psychological battle between Mann and the mysterious driver of the truck, whose identity remains mostly hidden throughout the film. Dennis Weaver gave a remarkable performance that earned critical acclaim from both audiences and critics alike. In 1959, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Dramatic Series for his role as Chester Goode in the iconic western television series, \\"Gunsmoke.\\" Weaver went on to have an extensive career in television and film, often portraying memorable characters in westerns and crime dramas.

Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the oil is not for a stove happens, how will it affect acid rain from the river flow and kill water life. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"To examine the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis, which in this case involves the introduction of oil, on the process of acid rain formation and its subsequent impact on river flow, water life, and the overall environment, it is necessary to understand the multiple interconnected factors that would come into play. First, let's review the primary process of acid rain production and its effects on the environment: 1. Acid rain is formed when chemicals, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are emitted into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and natural sources, such as burning fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions, and lightning strikes. 2. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other atmospheric substances to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall to the ground as acid rain. 3. Acid rain, with its lowered pH level, can break down rocks and soils, releasing heavy metals and other toxic substances into the environment. 4. It can also destroy vegetation, either through direct damage to leaves and roots or by altering soil chemistry and nutrient availability, which in turn can impact the ability of plants to acquire essential nutrients. 5. The loss of vegetation alters the surrounding environment, as plants play a critical role in maintaining the balance and stability of ecosystems, providing habitat and food resources for other organisms, and regulating hydrological cycles. Now let's consider the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the above process: A. Introduction of oil, particularly in a scenario where it is not being used for a stove (i.e., an oil spill or leakage), would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain and its environmental impacts. Direct effects: - An oil spill or leakage into a water body may cause physical damage to vegetation and wildlife, including water life, by coating the surface of plants, soil, and aquatic organisms with a layer of oil that inhibits the exchange of gases and nutrients. This physical damage may exacerbate the negative effects of acid rain. Indirect effects: 1. If the oil is derived from fossil fuels, its production, transportation, and usage could contribute to the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, increasing the formation of acid rain. 2. Oil spills or leaks may lead to cleanup and recovery efforts involving the use of chemicals and dispersants, which could themselves contribute to water pollution, potentially affecting the acidity of water bodies and further harming aquatic life. 3. The introduction of oil into an ecosystem could potentially alter the food chain or food web dynamics, which may, in turn, affect the resilience of the ecosystem to stressors such as acid rain. 4. Oil spills may increase public awareness and concern about environmental issues, potentially leading to regulatory changes and a shift towards cleaner energy sources that produce fewer sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, thereby indirectly reducing acid rain formation. In conclusion, the introduction of oil into the environment, under the context of the perturbation hypothesis, is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain formation and its impacts on river flow, water life, and the overall environment. While the direct effects may exacerbate the damage caused by acid rain, the indirect effects could either worsen or help alleviate the problem, depending on various factors such as public response and policy changes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The trick to thawing frozen milk is to use a slow, gradual process, never a quick one. For this reason, the easiest way to thaw your milk is usually simply to transfer it from the freezer to the refrigerator. The slightly warmer temperatures of the refrigerator will allow the milk to thaw to a liquid state little by little. This can take some time — depending on the volume of your frozen milk, it's not uncommon for it to take up to three days to thaw completely in the refrigerator. If you're in a hurry to thaw your milk, try filling your sink with cold water (not hot water) and submerging your frozen milk container in it. Use a heavy object like a cast iron pot to hold the milk underwater as it thaws. This process will be quicker than thawing the milk in the refrigerator but will still usually take several hours, so be patient. The reason that water thaws milk more quickly than the refrigerator has to do with the way that energy is transferred between the milk and its surroundings at a molecular level. Liquids transfer heat energy into ice much more effectively than air, making them a much quicker method of thawing. Never try to thaw your frozen milk quickly with heat. This is a sure-fire method for ruining your milk and undoing your hard work. Heating the milk can cause it to thaw unevenly or even burn, leaving you with a very unappealing finished product. Listed below are just a few tips for avoiding this situation: Don't leave your frozen milk out at room temperature. Don't thaw your milk in the microwave. Don't thaw your milk in hot water. Don't thaw your milk in a pot or pan on the stove. Don't thaw your milk in the sun. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that to thaw frozen milk, you should use a slow process, like moving it from the freezer to the refrigerator.

Paragraph: \\"Gail Collins loves telling the story of how Mitt Romney drove his family to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car -- and telling it, and telling it, and telling it. The liberal New York Times columnist has mentioned the incident in print 19 times, by our count. She devoted a column to the incident in 2007 when Romney first ran for president. In another column, she suggested John McCain pick Romney for his running mate \\"\\"so I can repeatedly revisit the time Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the station-wagon roof.\\"\\" And when Sarah Palin was picked instead, and Collins opined that \\"\\"unlike Mitt Romney, she has never gone on vacation with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" Collins regularly includes the incident in jocular news quizzes she writes. (A typical question: Which Republican hopeful \\"\\"continued to fail to explain why he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car?\\"\\" Mitt Romney.) She complained that his 2010 campaign book No Apology didn't mention it, calling it \\"\\"a critical oversight.\\"\\" Last year, just in time for the holidays, she suggested someone make \\"\\"a tasteful Mitt Romney Christmas Ornament\\"\\" depicting the scene of the dog on the roof. And just last week, she noted that the issue wasn't discussed during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library. Romney's top rival, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, reportedly shot a coyote that was threatening his daughter's dog, which made the Romney anecdote relevant. \\"\\"His puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering that Perry's chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" Aside from wondering why Collins is so obsessed with the story, we also wondered: Is it true? We reached Collins to ask her why she liked the story so much, but she said she'd rather let her columns speak for themselves. (See a picture of Seamus here.) The story of Seamus the Irish setter is not an Internet rumor. It first appeared in the august pages of the Boston Globe in 2007, when the paper published a seven-part profile of Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who had just launched a presidential run. The story of Seamus kicked off Day Four, a story about Romney's family life, written by Globe reporters Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert. It begins in 1983 with a 36-year-old Mitt Romney carefully packing up his five sons and luggage into the family station wagon for a 12-hour trip from Boston to Ontario, where his parents had a cottage on Lake Huron. At the time, Romney was a successful young consultant with Bain & Company, but he hadn't yet started buying and selling companies with Bain Capital in the private equity field. \\"\\"As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. ... Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. \\"\\" Cruel? It's not presented that way in the story, which noted Romney built a special windshield for the carrier, \\"\\"to make the ride more comfortable for the dog.\\"\\" But Seamus must not have been all that comfortable, because he began to experience, um, gastric distress. From the story: As the oldest son, Tagg Romney commandeered the way-back of the wagon, keeping his eyes fixed out the rear window, where he glimpsed the first sign of trouble. ''Dad!'' he yelled. ''Gross!'' A brown liquid was dripping down the back window, payback from an Irish setter who'd been riding on the roof in the wind for hours. As the rest of the boys joined in the howls of disgust, Romney coolly pulled off the highway and into a service station. There, he borrowed a hose, washed down Seamus and the car, then hopped back onto the highway. It was a tiny preview of a trait he would grow famous for in business: emotion-free crisis management. As the story quickly made its way around the Internet, Romney loathers -- and dog lovers -- had a field day. The liberal blog Wonkette said it showed Romney would be a great commander-in-chief for the notorious Iraq prison Abu Ghraib. David Kravitz of the liberal blog Blue Mass Group called it \\"\\"nuts\\"\\" and \\"\\"classic Romney: it solves a problem efficiently, in a business-like manner, and with no regard whatsoever for the suffering that the solution may cause.\\"\\" Ingrid Newkirk of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals told Time's Ana Marie Cox that Romney was giving his children \\"\\"a lesson in cruelty\\"\\" and that dogs under extreme stress might lose control of their bowels. \\"\\"That alone should have been sufficient indication that the dog was, basically, being tortured,\\"\\" she said. Cox explored whether Romney's actions might have been illegal under animal cruelty laws. (A moot point, because the statute of limitations has long expired.) As to the accuracy of the story, the Globe learned of the incident from friends of the family and confirmed the details with the Romney family. And the candidate himself didn't dispute the report. In fact, in the days following, he defended it. Seamus loved riding in the carrier, Romney told reporters on the campaign trail in 2007. \\"\\"He scrambled up there every time we went on trips,\\"\\" Romney said. \\"\\"He got (up) all by himself and enjoyed it.\\"\\" He also said PETA had targeted him because there was a rodeo at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and because he went quail hunting in Georgia. \\"\\"And they're not happy that my dog likes fresh air,\\"\\" he added. Actually, Seamus had been dead -- of natural, non-station wagon-related causes -- for years when the story appeared. (He had retired to California to live with Romney's sister, who had more space.) We didn't get answers about Seamus from the Romney campaign, but from Neil Swidey, the Boston Globe reporter who unearthed the story. Swidey said he chose the incident to begin his story because he thought it would resonate with readers as an illustration of Romney's approach to solving problems -- trip is interrupted by dog poop, so Romney pulls over, borrows a hose, takes care of the problem, and is back on his way. \\"\\"I certainly didn't write it to make it the basis on which you judge a presidential candidate. The fact that some people appear to be doing that is a little bit crazy. But I can understand why it resonates with people,\\"\\" Swidey said. \\"\\"It's a window into how this guy operates.\\"\\" Swidey said some people see it as evidence of Romney's heartlessness, while others see him as logical man and a problem solver. He confirmed the impression we got from reading the story, that the incident was amusing family lore, and that none of the Romney family was upset or disturbed by the dog riding on the roof. In fact, some of the Romneys said they thought the dog actually liked riding on the roof. (Finally, lest we be accused of utter frivolousness, we asked Swidey what aspects of Romney's biography might be more relevant to voters considering Romney for president. He pointed us toward the Globe's coverage of Romney's business career in private equity, his time as governor and Romney's relationship with his father George, who ran for president himself back in 1968.) Here, we're ruling on Collins' statement that Romney \\"\\"drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"\\" It's important to note that the dog was not literally strapped to the car, as in tied around its midsection. Rather, Seamus was in a carrier with a protective windscreen that Romney had built. The dog's diarrhea might indicate that something was amiss, but Romney's family didn't seem bothered by it. The anecdote is presented in the Globe as funny family story, not as evidence of Romney's barbaric cruelty.\\" Claim: \\"Mitt Romney \\"\\"drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.\\"","completion":"The claim that Mitt Romney drove to Canada with the family dog, Seamus, strapped to the roof of the car is supported by several instances mentioned in the paragraph. The story originates from a seven-part profile of Romney in the Boston Globe by Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert, where they discuss Romney's family journey from Boston to Ontario in 1983. To accommodate the family and luggage, Mitt put Seamus, their Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon’s roof rack. Following this, however, the dog suffered from gastric distress due to the discomfort of the journey, which led to a mess on the back window of the car. Regardless, Romney’s family treated this event as more of an amusing family anecdote than a display of cruelty. It is also noted that the dog was not directly tied to the car, but secured inside a carrier that was affixed to the roof, with Romney even having built a special windscreen for the carrier to improve Seamus's comfort. Hence, the claim is essentially true, with a special mention that the story encapsulates Romney’s problem-solving approach and emotion-free crisis management rather than being an instance of animal abuse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The way the roach’s senses changed, experts say, is an elegant example of quick evolutionary change in behavior, and offers the multibillion-dollar pest control industry valuable insights into enemy secrets, perhaps even revealing some clues for the fight against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, which are far more dangerous to human health than roaches. Photo “This is a fantastic discovery,” said Walter S. Leal, the head of the entomology department in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at the University of California, Davis. (Dr. Leal was not part of the research.) “Sometimes,” he said, “the science is beautiful but you don’t know whether there is going to be an application five years from now, 10 years from now or 100 years.” But in this case, he said, the impact is both fundamental and practical. Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Jules Silverman and Coby Schal, all at North Carolina State University, who wrote the report in Science, set out to explain a well-known phenomenon: Some populations of German cockroaches (the ones that apartment dwellers see scurrying around in the kitchen at night) avoid poison bait that is laced with glucose, which is supposed to attract them. This behavior, discovered by Dr. Silverman, “first appeared in the early ’90s,” said Jim Fredericks, chief entomologist at the National Pest Management Association, shortly after exterminators — who now prefer to be called pest management professionals — started using poison baits instead of spraying as the main method of battling roaches. To get around the problem, the industry developed new baits, but the change in roach behavior was a puzzle. Grzegorz Buczkowski, an entomologist at Purdue University who was not involved in the research, said the industry was always developing new poisons, because roaches and other pests become resistant to their effects, just as bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. “We lose baits all the time,” he said. But in this case, the problem was not a poison that had become ineffective. The cockroaches just seemed to avoid any bait that had glucose. Continue reading the main story Video Dr. Silverman showed that this behavior was inherited, not something an individual roach learned during its brief life. And a few years ago the North Carolina researchers decided to investigate what caused the change. Instead of taste buds, roaches have taste hairs on many parts of their bodies. The three North Carolina researchers concentrated on those around the mouth area and on two types of nerve cells that sense tastes and respond by firing electrical signals to the brain. One responds only to sugars and other sweet substances; the other responds only to bitter substances. Whenever a molecule of something sweet attaches to a sweet detector, it fires electrical impulses and the roach brain senses sweetness, which makes it want to eat whatever it is tasting. Whenever a molecule of something bitter attaches to the bitter detector, that cell fires and the brain senses bitterness, which makes the roach want to avoid that substance. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But somehow the roaches had changed so that the glucose made the bitter detector fire. “Basically,” said Dr. Buczkowski, “when cockroaches taste glucose, they’re repelled by it because it tastes bitter to them.” Dr. Schal said the next step was to figure out the details of the genetic mutation that had occurred. Perhaps a mutation changed the molecules that detect bitter substances so that they would be sensitive to glucose, too. Or a different sort of mutation could have caused the dedicated bitter neurons to have lots of standard glucose detectors, which did not exist on those neurons before — a shift that also would have made the insects register sweet glucose as bitter. The research may be relevant far beyond roach control, perhaps helping to explain the behavior of mosquitoes that spread malaria, Dr. Schal said. “The mosquito changed its behavior,” he said, “and no longer rests on walls that are treated with insecticide. Instead it tends to rest on the ceiling, or it tends to rest on the outside walls that are not treated with insecticide. “We still don’t understand the cellular, the neural mechanism responsible for this change in behavior of the mosquito,” he said, so the approach that yielded results with the cockroach could offer useful insights. ||||| Several populations of the German cockroach have become averse to the glucose used as bait in toxic traps, which has severely reduced the traps' effectiveness. Wada-Katsumata et al. (p. 972 ) show that this aversion is a result of changes in the peripheral gustatory system, whereby glucose, as well as “sweet” receptors, stimulated an aversive bitter compound receptor. Abstract In response to the anthropogenic assault of toxic baits, populations of the German cockroach have rapidly evolved an adaptive behavioral aversion to glucose (a phagostimulant component of baits). We hypothesized that changes in the peripheral gustatory system are responsible for glucose aversion. In both wild-type and glucose-averse (GA) cockroaches, d-fructose and d-glucose stimulated sugar–gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), whereas the deterrent caffeine stimulated bitter-GRNs. In contrast, in GA cockroaches, d-glucose also stimulated bitter-GRNs and suppressed the responses of sugar-GRNs. Thus, d-glucose is processed as both a phagostimulant and deterrent in GA cockroaches, and this newly acquired peripheral taste sensitivity underlies glucose aversion in multiple GA populations. The rapid emergence of this highly adaptive behavior underscores the plasticity of the sensory system to adapt to rapid environmental change. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Cockroaches are very good at surviving, and some of them have now evolved to be even better by changing the way their taste works so that they don't like the taste of sweet things. This helps them to avoid poison traps that use sweet tastes to lure them in. Scientists think this new research could even help find ways to fight mosquitoes that spread diseases like malaria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, let's break them down step by step. Question 1: Step 1: Understand the context of the Navajo Code Talkers. The Navajo Code Talkers were Native American soldiers who used their native language to transmit coded messages during World War II. Step 2: Consider the 21st-century context. In the 21st century, there have been significant advancements in technology and encryption. Step 3: Analyze the effectiveness of the Navajo Code Talkers in the 21st century. Given the advanced encryption methods we have at our disposal today and the fact that the Navajo language is no longer as obscure as it was during World War II, it is unlikely that the Navajo Code Talkers would be as effective. Question 2: Step 1: Understand the context of the Pacific theater. The Pacific theater was a major theater of World War II, where the Allies fought against Japan. Step 2: Determine the role of the Navajo Code Talkers in the Pacific theater. The Navajo Code Talkers played a crucial role in transmitting coded messages that would have been very difficult for the enemy to decipher. Step 3: Identify factors that made Navajo Code Talkers integral. The Navajo language was considered to be very difficult to learn and understand for non-native speakers, which made it incredibly difficult for the enemy to crack the code. They were also highly skilled in combat and able to work well in the challenging conditions of the Pacific theater. Conclusion: The answers to these two questions are not the same. While the Navajo Code Talkers were very effective and integral during World War II, especially in the Pacific theater, their effectiveness in the 21st century would likely be much lower due to advancements in technology and encryption methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Members of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Equality (RFSU) selected \\"klittra\\" from a shortlist of words put together after launching a national competition last year. The group said it wanted to encourage a single, nationally-recognized word for the activity after noting the absence of such a term in Swedish, while there are numerous words that directly refer to men having solo sex. News of the planned contest went global when it was first launched November 2014 and the organization received more than 1,200 emails, comments, postcards and letters, and around 200 unique word suggestions. It later published a shortlist of 40 words for the public to vote on, with \\"klittra\\" proving the most successful and \\"pulla\\" and \\"runka\\" the next popular alternatives. The RFSU's final decision to promote the word \\"klittra\\" was reached following a poll at an RFSU conference in Västerås, north east of Stockholm, over the weekend, and gained prominence in the Swedish media on Wednesday. \\"Historically, women's sexuality and not least female masturbation has been taboo,\\" the RFSU said in a statement. \\"Women are not expected to have desires and be turned on in the same way as men, which is reflected in the lack of words [for masturbation],\\" it added. The statement noted that one advantage of \\"klittra\\" is that it \\"highlights the importance of the clitoris for pleasure\\". RFSU is already starting to campaign for the word to be included in the next edition of Sweden's official dictionary (Svenska Akademiens ordlista or SAOL). \\"Now RFSU members have had their say, the obvious word for female masturbation is klittra. Now we hope that the public begins to use the word so that it is only a matter of time until we see it in SAOL,\\" said RFSU's spokesperson Kristina Ljungros. Ljungros has previously told The Local that more needs to be done to encourage Swedes to discuss female sexuality. \\"We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust,\\" she said. \\"When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?\\" ||||| As many as 50,000 balloons in the yellow and blue colors of the Swedish flag are released into the air above a crowd in Stockholm on June 6, 2008, as Sweden marks its national day. (Scanpix Sweden via AP Photo/ Maja Suslin) In the Egalia, a preschool in Stockholm, there are no male or female students. Instead, all children are referred to as 'hen' – a gender-neutral pronoun that has become so established in Sweden that it will be recognized next month in the newest edition of the country's official dictionary. The Swedish Academy's SAOL dictionary, which is updated every 10 years and will be republished April 15, will feature 'hen' as an alternative to the male pronoun 'han' and the female 'hon.' The revised edition will also include thousands of other new words. According to linguistic expert Sofia Malmgård, the gender-neutral term can be used in two ways. \\"First, if the gender is unknown or not relevant (as in: \\"If anyone needs to smoke, 'hen' may do so outside\\"). Second, it can be used as a pronoun for inter-gender people (as in: \\"Kim is neither boy or girl, 'hen' is inter-gender\\"),\\" she explained. To many Swedes, the decision of the Swedish Academy reflects how quickly their society has embraced gender-neutral language. \\"Over the last few years, the word 'hen' has more and more found its way into the Swedish language,\\" Malmgård told The Washington Post. Five years ago, barely anyone in Sweden was aware of the word. The decision to now include 'hen' in the authoritative SAOL dictionary is expected to facilitate an even more frequent use of it in everyday conversations. Set up in 1785, the academy was established with the aim to adapt the Swedish languages to changing cultural and societal influences – a role the institution still feels committed to. According to experts, the 'hen'-revolution in Sweden has two primary origins: LGBT groups have promoted the pronoun as a way to raise awareness for their cause. However, support for the idea has also come from a more unexpected side: Nurseries, kindergartens and preschools such as Egalia increasingly argue that the pronoun's usage allows children to grow up without feeling the impact of gender biases. \\"The public debate over the pronoun actually only started after the publication of the country's first gender-neutral children's book\\", Lann Hornscheidt, an professor of Scandinavian languages and gender studies at Berlin's Humboldt University explained. Gender-neutral education in Sweden goes far beyond linguistics. As the BBC already observed in 2011, toys and games in some nurseries are placed deliberately next to each other, in the hope that children will feel free to choose the items they feel most comfortable spending their time with. To Hornscheidt, the popularity of 'hen' has not come as a surprise. \\"The introduction of a pronoun which challenges binary gender norms has been an important step, following a more thorough debate over the construction of gender within the last 10 years,\\" he said. The Berlin-based researcher nevertheless cautions that simply introducing a gender-neutral pronoun in other countries may not be sufficient to fight sexism or gender-biases. Turkey, for instance, also has a gender-neutral pronoun. Nevertheless, the country was only ranked 125th in the 2014 gender equality report of the World Economic Forum. Sweden came fourth. ||||| A sex education group in Sweden is looking for an alternative phrase to describe the sexual act, to help normalise female sexual pleasure. The organisation has launched a competition asked for alternative suggestions to the phrase ‘female masturbation’ and will vote on the winning entry in June 2015. “We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust,” Kristina Ljungros of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (known as RFSU) told a Swedish news site. “When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?” Entrants were told: “Please note that we are primarily looking for a word, not an expression. The RFSU has received more than a thousand entries since it launched the competition earlier this month – including ‘klinka’ and ‘flick’. ‘Selfie’ also made it onto the list, giving a new meaning to the word that made it into the Oxford English Dictionary last year. But the RFSU has narrowed them down to a shortlist of 34 words including ‘pulla’ and ‘selfa’. \\"So many people have been discussing the competition all over Sweden so it seems that people agree that there is something lacking in the Swedish language,\\" Ljungros told The Local. “The absence of one commonly used word for female masturbation suggests that we still don't have gender equality here in Sweden. Hopefully this is another step towards that.\\" She also said that the debate could be much more of a taboo in other countries, and that Sweden did have a “more liberal attitude to sex”. Previously the RFSU published research renaming the hymen a 'vaginal corona'. The idea was to dispel myths surrounding the hymen, which is made up of thin, elastic folds of mucuous membrane just inside the entrance to the vagina. It has no known function, and is not a thick membrane entirely covering a woman's vaginal opening, as is sometimes believed. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Swedish Association for Sexuality Equality (RFSU) ran a national competition to select \\"klittra\\" as a single, nationally-recognized word for female masturbation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If college athletes were to start being paid, many schools would leave Division I sports, NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday. And the universities that stayed in Division I sports would have to start cutting other, less popular sports to be able to afford the salaries. There would be less competition and no more national championship games — at least not in their current form, Emmert said. Emmert testified at the landmark federal trial for former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He and other athletes are suing for the opportunity for future athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses when they play sports on television. Emmert said he believes the customs that most college sports fans hold most dear -- the camaraderie of game day, the tailgating, the atmosphere of a stadium packed with nearly 100,000 fans and the pride of cheering for a university team -- are at stake. \\"Traditions and keeping them are very important to universities,\\" Emmert said. \\"These individuals are not professionals. They are representing their universities as part of a university community. \\"People come to watch ... because it's college sports, with college athletes,\\" he said. Those beloved traditions go hand in hand with the model of amateurism, and if amateurism goes away, so will the games as we know them now, he said. Many schools lose money on Division I athletics but keep them for the \\"social cohesion\\" and the boost to their profiles, Emmert said. Emmert said officials at several member schools have told him that if athletes were to start getting paid beyond the cost of attendance, institutions would ditch Division I sports and opt for Division II or III, in which coach's salaries, stadiums, hype and scholarships are much smaller. \\"Do the members want the sports to remain amateur?\\" an NCAA lawyer asked. \\"Yes,\\" Emmert replied. \\"If the rules were changed to permit student athletes to be paid for (names, images and likenesses), would that change what college sports is all about? \\"Yes, it would.\\" Never before has the NCAA membership — leaders at about 1,100 colleges and universities — proposed changing the rules to allow college athletes to be paid. However, they are currently considering giving athletes a bit more \\"miscellaneous\\" money to cover the full cost of attending college. Emmert, a much-anticipated witness at the three-week trial, testified for five hours Thursday and is expected to continue on Friday. On the stand, Emmert embodied the NCAA's no-budge, no-compromise take on the issue of pay-for-play, citing the organization's century-old history. In the five years since the O'Bannon suit was first filed, there have been several controversies and many attempts to reform the NCAA. Emmert acknowledged that public opinion of the organization is low and that part of his directive when he took this job was to fix that. While he made no concessions to the argument of hypocrisy in college sports — the idea that everyone else involved makes money, except the athletes — Emmert did concede that the commercialization of college sports is overwhelming the amateurism. He said the use of athletes' names, images and likenesses is \\"one of the most debated topics in NCAA history.\\" One of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson, displayed picture after picture of athletes with corporate logos and asked, \\"Putting athletes in front of logos, that's all fine under NCAA rules?\\" \\"It's not something I'm personally comfortable with,\\" Emmert responded. \\"... It's certainly not where I would prefer the rules be drawn.\\" Responding to questions from U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken about commercial exploitation, Emmert said the schools have chosen to define it to mean that college athletes should not be acting as \\"pitchmen\\" for products. A recent poll conducted by the Saint Leo University Polling Institute showed that 66% of Americans don't think athletes should be paid beyond scholarship money. But complicating the issue are recent academic scandals and consistent court testimony from athletes from several different schools that they were athletes first, not students. Emmert responded by saying that it's hard to get motivated athletes to focus more on schoolwork, but he insisted that they are motivated to play college sports because of the education they receive. But when he was asked about that education, he first mentioned the life experience that athletes earn on the field, then discussed what they learn in class. O'Bannon's lawyers questioned Emmert at length about an e-mail sent to him at the start of his presidency by a senior member of the organization, Wallace Renfro. It said \\"the notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate athletics\\" and said the public believes the athletes are exploited in the name of money for higher-caliber coaches and bigger stadiums. Last week, O'Bannon's lawyers said that even if Wilken were to rule in their favor, the conferences and colleges could still decide on their own not to share any of the television revenues with athletes. As long as the NCAA doesn't have a rule against it, it would still be OK for colleges to choose not to pay. Rules, Emmert testified, are necessary. \\"It's essential there be a body that provides rule-making,\\" he said. \\"One of the most fundamental principles of fair competition is that everyone is playing by the same rules. Everyone understands they are governing and conducting the game the same way from one side of the country to another. You couldn't do it nationally without those rules.\\" As testimony starts in former college star's suit, NCAA settles another suit. NCAA faces change, legal challenges in months ahead. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is talking about college athletes and if they should be paid for playing sports. The NCAA President, Mark Emmert, said that if college athletes start getting paid for playing, many schools would not be able to afford it and they would have to leave Division I sports. This would result in less competition and no more national championship games. College sports fans like the traditions and atmosphere of games, and paying the athletes might change that. Some schools already lose money on sports, but keep them for the social benefits and reputation. If athletes were paid, some schools might move to Division II or III, where everything is smaller and costs less. The NCAA is currently considering giving athletes a little more money to help with the costs of going to college, but not paying them for playing sports."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not wanting to plan/heavily participate in a second baby shower: - Personal preference: It could be due to personal or emotional reasons, and not necessarily unethical. - Potential harm: There is no inherent harm caused to others by not participating or planning a second baby shower. 2. Suing an ex-friend for 20k because of them disrespecting me: - Motivation: The motivation behind the action is a feeling of personal disrespect, which is a subjective criterion. - Potential harm: This action could cause financial distress and further damage relationships. Comparing both actions, suing an ex-friend for 20k for a subjective feeling of disrespect appears less ethical than not wanting to plan or participate in a second baby shower.

Vendôme, one of the best French generals, took command and was substantially reinforced; Prince Eugene managed a draw at the Battle of Luzzara but the French recovered most of the territory lost the year before. In October 1703, Victor Amadeus declared war on France; by May 1706, the French held most of Savoy except Turin while victories at Cassano and Calcinato forced the Imperialists into the Trentino valley However, in July 1706 Vendôme and any available forces were sent to reinforce France's northern frontier after the defeat at Ramillies. Reinforced by German auxiliaries, Prince Eugene marched on Turin and the siege was broken by the Battle of Turin on 7 September. Despite a minor French victory at Castiglione, the war in Italy was over; the Convention of Milan in March 1707 confirmed Austria's control of Milan and Mantua, with French troops given free passage back to France for redeployment elsewhere. An attack by forces from Italy on the French base of Toulon was planned for 1707 but was postponed when 10,000 Imperial troops were diverted in June to seize the Spanish Bourbon Kingdom of Naples. The delays contributed to the failure of the siege of Toulon; by the end of 1707, fighting in Italy ceased apart from attempts by Victor Amadeus to recover his trans-Alpine territories of Nice and Savoy. What did the French not control in Savoy?","completion":"According to the provided text, the French did not control Turin in Savoy.

Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. Which material is less resistant to changing shape? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine which material is less resistant to changing shape, we need to analyze the results of Nelly's test. Here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. Nelly secures one end of the Glubber material to a table, stretches it, and then releases it. The Glubber quickly snaps back to its original position. This indicates that it has a strong elastic force, which makes the material more resistant to changing its shape. 2. Nelly performs the same test with the Malk material. When she stretches the material and releases it, the material slowly crawls along the floor, taking its time to return to its original position. This indicates that the elastic force in the Malk material is weaker, making it less resistant to changing its shape. Based on the results of the test, the material that is less resistant to changing shape is Malk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a question about the following article: On 19 November 1921, about 100 Moplah prisoners were sent by train from Malabar to Coimbatore. They were packed in goods wagons which, of course, had no ventilation. So, when the doors were opened after a five hours' journey, the prisoners were found to be in a state of collapse, with horrible wounds inflicted by bites and bows in one another by the struggling men. In all, 82 men died. In the aftermath of this ethnic cleansing, the Suddhi Movement was created by the Arya Samaj.

She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that?

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who clashes with Robert? from the following article ? Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns. However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion. A:","completion":"The full name of the man who clashes with Robert in the article is Wedge Donovan.

How could he know if the gold coins he examined in a shop were real? “I knew there were a fair amount of fakes out there,“ Mr. Myers said. ”There were a lot of good deals that I passed up on because I didn’t want to take the chance.” What was this article about?","completion":"The article, titled \\"Gold Is Hot This Year. So Are Fakes,\\" discusses the increased occurrence of counterfeit gold coins in the market and the concerns it raises among potential buyers such as David Myers, a pharmacist based in New York. The article portrays Myers' eagerness to expand his gold holdings while simultaneously highlighting his apprehensions about the authenticity of the gold coins he encounters in shops. The piece sheds light on the growing popularity of gold as an investment option, resulting in a high demand for the precious metal. The surge in gold prices has inadvertently increased the number of forged gold coins circulating in the market, with fraudsters looking to capitalize on this demand. In light of this worrying trend, investors like Myers are forced to exercise caution when purchasing gold coins, often opting to pass up on seemingly lucrative deals due to the risk of acquiring counterfeit items. The article likely delves into the reasons behind the escalating number of fake gold coins and explores the consequences faced by unsuspecting investors who fall prey to these scams. Furthermore, the piece might touch upon the various methods that investors can use to identify and avoid counterfeit gold coins and discuss the role of governments, financial regulatory bodies, and certified dealers in combating this growing threat. The article serves as a reminder to investors and collectors to remain vigilant and well-informed about this issue, especially during a period when gold continues to be a sought-after investment option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you brush your teeth too roughly, over time it can cause your gums to recede. Brushing gently with a soft bristled brush can allow your gums the ability to recover. There are some electric toothbrushes that will give you a warning when you are pushing too hard. If you have a history of brushing too hard, this might be a good product to invest in. If you have receding gums, it may be caused by a lack of basic dental care. If you haven't been brushing, start brushing twice a day. This will minimize the buildup of bacteria and food debris around your gum line, which will allow your gums to grow back. Be sure to use a toothpaste that has fluoride in it. If you really want to keep your teeth clean, begin brushing your teeth after each meal. Flossing daily will remove food debris, bacteria, and plaque build up from between your teeth. This will allow the gums in between your teeth to remain healthy. There are also special picks and brushes that your dentist may recommend for cleaning between your teeth. If you are grinding or clenching your teeth, the force you are creating can make your gums recede. To soften this force and allow your gums to regenerate, start wearing a bite guard. Signs that you are grinding your teeth include a sore jaw or face, chipped or flattened teeth, tooth pain, and an unexplained headache. Many people choose to wear their bite guard at night, when teeth grinding can occur involuntarily. If you are suffering from dry mouth, it can also increase the likelihood that your gums will recede. To increase your saliva production, try chewing sugar-free gum regularly or talk to your doctor about medications that can help increase the amount of saliva you are producing. Saliva protects the gums from bacteria and plaque build up, so having too little of it can impact your gum health. Summary:","completion":"Brushing your teeth too roughly can cause gum recession, so use a soft-bristled brush and consider investing in an electric toothbrush with pressure warnings. To promote gum health, practice proper dental hygiene by brushing twice a day or after each meal, flossing daily, and using fluoride toothpaste. Special picks and brushes may also be recommended by your dentist. If you grind or clench your teeth, wear a bite guard to reduce force on your gums.

I read this background article the other day: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. I am facing a new situation today: Ken is a microbiologist. He got two samples of yeasts, yeast A and yeast B, from two different businesses. Yeast A is used in a bakery, and yeast B is used in a brewery. He has to decide the characteristics of each yeast sample for further study. Interestingly, despite all his curiosity, Ken doesn't like any yeast to be around him. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: If Ken doen't like any yeast around him, which yeast he should not worry about, yeas A or yeast B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ken should not worry about either yeast A or yeast B being around him. Here are the steps to justify this answer: 1. Both yeast A and yeast B are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, according to the background article. 2. Yeast A is used in baking, while yeast B is used in brewing. Therefore, both of them are commonly utilized in their respective industries, which means they have distinct characteristics tailored for those purposes. 3. It is important to note in the background article that baker's yeast, a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is commonly found on and around the human body. Since both yeast A and yeast B are strains of the same species, it can be inferred that they are both naturally occurring microorganisms that would be around humans regardless of Ken's preference. 4. As Ken is a microbiologist, he is likely trained to work with and around microorganisms, including yeast. It would be expected for him to encounter these yeasts in his line of work, so not wanting any yeast around him would be an impractical preference. In conclusion, Ken should not be concerned about either yeast A or yeast B being around him, as they are both strains of a species naturally found around humans, and as a microbiologist, he should be equipped to handle them professionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Robert Frost and Thomas Sigismund Stribling both share American nationality. Before diving into their common nationality, let's discuss their individual backgrounds and achievements to understand their connection better. Robert Frost (1874-1963) was an American poet, born in San Francisco, California, known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech. Raised primarily in Massachusetts, he published his first poem in 1894 and subsequently gained tremendous recognition and admiration. Throughout his lifetime, he was honored with four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. His most prominent works include collections like 'North of Boston,' 'Mountain Interval,' 'New Hampshire,' 'A Further Range,' and others. With poems such as \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\\" and \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\\" Frost has secured his place as one of America's most celebrated poets. Thomas Sigismund Stribling (1881-1965), born in Clifton, Tennessee, was an American writer and novelist, primarily known for his works of social protest. Stribling studied at the University of Alabama and later became a journalist, teacher, and attorney. His Southern-set novels focused on critical evaluations of the social order, racial prejudice, and economic inequalities in the United States between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Era. Some of his notable works include 'Teeftallow,' 'The Store,' 'The Forge,' and 'Unfinished Cathedral.' His writing earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1933 for his novel 'The Store,' making him one of the pioneering southern writers during the early 20th century. In conclusion, both Robert Frost and Thomas Sigismund Stribling were American by nationality. They each contributed significantly to American literature, especially poetry and prose, respectively. While they might have approached their literary works differently, their shared nationality played a role in shaping their perspectives and influencing their writings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was particularly influential during the years of the Weimar Republic with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. The Nazi era produced mostly propaganda films although the work of Leni Riefenstahl still introduced new aesthetics in film. From the 1960s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, Rainer Werner Fassbinder placed West-German cinema back onto the international stage with their often provocative films, while the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft controlled film production in the GDR.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Car tows skier through Detroit suburb as news camera rolls Some skiers will stop at nothing in the search for fresh powder. Exhibit A: a man who skied through the streets of suburban Detroit on 1 February, carving S-turns down a snow-covered road as he was being towed by a car – until police intervened. Incredibly, Detroit news station WXYZ-TV was interviewing the mayor of Warren, Michigan, about hazardous driving conditions and showing live footage of the road when the skier cruised past. Told of the incident, mayor Jim Fouts wasted no time in condemning the stunt. “It’s horrendous,” he told the station. “That driver would certainly get a ticket if there was a police officer in that area. It’s very dangerous.” Moments later, as the station continued to broadcast live, a police car pulled over the skier, bringing the stunt to an end. Urban skiing isn’t exactly new. More than a decade ago, skiers and snowboarders inspired by skateboarders began sliding down handrails and other man-mad features found in snowy cityscapes. The practice continues today, with adherents often trying to stay a step ahead of local police. Needless to say, not all skiing near major cities has to end with police intervention. Some urban centres – Interlaken, Switzerland comes to mind – have more favourable conditions nearby. In fact, almost all of these cities would make fine choices.","completion":"A skier was caught on live TV being towed by a car through a snow-covered road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan, as local news station WXYZ-TV was interviewing the city's mayor about hazardous driving conditions.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

Article: Left unfettered , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \\"age compression \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...

Step 1: Combine like terms The equation given is -z + 4*z - 9 = 0. We see there are two terms involving z: -z and 4*z. We can combine these two terms by adding them together. (-z) + (4*z) = (-1 + 4) * z = 3 * z So, the equation becomes: 3*z - 9 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable z Now, we need to isolate z on one side of the equation.

Is Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, your statement provides the basic explanation, but it might be helpful to delve a little deeper to present a more comprehensive response. The color transformation in grapes, like purple grapes, is mainly related to the production of a group of chemicals called anthocyanins, which belong to the larger class of molecules called flavonoids. More specifically, these anthocyanins are mainly synthesized during the last stages of grape maturation. Anthocyanin synthesis is controlled by a complex network of genes. The two regulatory genes that you mentioned in your statement are likely referring to VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2. Mutations in these two genes indeed prevent the production of anthocyanins, resulting in white grapes instead of the common purple ones. However, let's also note that environmental factors, like pH, light exposure, and temperature, can influence the color of grape berries too, demonstrating that it's not just genetics that play a role. So, while the specific genes involved are important, anthocyanin production — and therefore grape color — is a result of a complex process rather than the action of a single gene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From a snowy Christmas lunch in Antarctica to the spectacular light projections currently brightening the facade of Sydney's St Mary's cathedral, the world is gearing up for Christmas in style. But for festive fun, little compares to London's very own Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, which, as these stunning images reveal, comes with lashings of Christmas cheer. Also enjoying a spot of festive cheer were the crew of HMS Protector, a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, who stopped for an early Christmas lunch on an Antarctic ice floe. Scroll down for video. Festive fun: The crew of HMS Protector, an ice patrol ship, tuck into an early Christmas lunch while sitting on an Antarctic ice floe. Lunch was followed by a football match. Working holiday: The crew were forced to have their celebrations early because the ship will be at sea on Christmas Day which means there will be no time to celebrate. Record attempt: Chefs in Ham, a village in France's Picardie region attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the planet's longest Yule Log. Although the ship will be at sea on Wednesday - leaving no time for Christmas fun - Captain Rhett Hatcher allowed his crew time off for a roast turkey dinner in a real-life winter wonderland and a game of football. Captain Hatcher said: 'Spending Christmas in the coldest, windiest and driest place on earth comes with a number of challenges but it is a truly unique privilege.' Closer to home, a group of intrepid French pastry chefs attempted to break the record for world's longest Christmas log in the northern French commune of Ham in the French Picardie region. Equally tasty were the offerings of traders at the Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park, who enjoyed a bumper day as shoppers ventured out in search of the perfect present. The temporary, festive theme park runs for over six weeks and features an ice rink, several large rides and numerous food and gift stalls. Tasty: The chefs have to beat the Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La, which in 2011, created a new Guinness World Record with a 1068-metre long Yule log. Festive: A trader serves up a selection of beautifully decorated gingerbread hearts at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park. Sparkling: The historic park has been transformed into a festive paradise complete with a neon ferris wheel, an ice rink and a miniature train set. Tasty treat: A warmly wrapped up couple inspect the colourful penny sweets on display at one large stand at Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland. Spectacular: Winter Wonderland has become an annual tradition and continues until January 5th 2014, although it is closed on Christmas Day. Further north, Bradford residents were enjoying the 18 Christmas-themed ice sculptures which were installed at City Park, Bradford, by artist Jamie Wardley earlier this month. Among them are characters from Wardley's own story, The Children of the Snow and the Boy with the Little Idea, and a life-sized sleigh complete with elves. In Country Durham, the Beamish Open Air Museum got a festive makeover, complete with lights for its collection of vintage trams and buses. A working steam carousel turned under the cover of darkness, while Santa Claus answered children's wishes in his fireside grotto. But perhaps most spectacular of all were the light images that appeared on the side of St Mary's cathedral in Sydney. Entitled Lights of Christmas, the light show includes projections of stunningly detailed biblical scenes, a portrait of Mary and baby Jesus and a gorgeous starry night. Magical: A local inspects three of the 18 ice sculptures on display in Bradford's City Park. The pieces are the work of children's author and artist Jamie Wardley. Old-fashioned: The Beamish Open Air Museum in Country Durham has had a festive makeover, complete with vintage lights and traditional Christmas trees.

Please answer the following question: Context: Kendall told Jan's brother about Jan smoking weed behind the bleachers during games. Question: How would Jan feel as a result? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: betrayed by their friend B: happy people know C: relieved it's out in the open Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the answer that best captures Jan's feelings as a result of Kendall telling Jan's brother about the weed-smoking incident behind the bleachers during games is: A: Betrayed by their friend When evaluating the three given options, it is crucial to consider the situation and the emotional responses it might evoke. Given that Jan was smoking weed in a hidden location (behind the bleachers), it can be inferred that they did not want this information to be known by others. People generally choose discreet locations for activities they consider private or potentially damaging if revealed. Now, let's break down the logic behind each potential answer: A: Betrayed by their friend - In this scenario, Kendall, who is presumably a friend of Jan, shared confidential information about Jan's actions to Jan's brother. Jan might feel exposed and betrayed by their friend, who chose to divulge this sensitive information instead of respecting Jan's privacy. B: Happy people know - It would be unlikely for Jan to feel happy that others now know about their weed-smoking habit, especially given the choice of location (behind bleachers) which indicates a desire for secrecy on Jan's part. Additionally, the reaction of family (in this case, Jan's brother) is unpredictable in such circumstances, potentially resulting in uncomfortable conversations or a potential loss of trust, which would not make Jan feel happy. C: Relieved it's out in the open - Although there's a possibility that someone might feel relieved when a secret is out in the open, in this context, it seems far more likely for Jan to feel betrayed or upset. Given the private and secretive nature of the location and the activity, Jan probably would not want their brother or others to know about their behavior. In conclusion, Option A: Betrayed by their friend is the most fitting answer to the question of how Jan would feel, based on the provided context. It encompasses the likely emotional response to a friend revealing sensitive personal information to a family member without Jan's consent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Screeching Weasel is an American punk rock band originally from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois. The band was formed in 1986 by Ben Weasel and John Jughead. Since their formation, Screeching Weasel have broken up and reformed numerous times with numerous line-up changes. Ben Weasel has been the only constant member, though Jughead was present in every incarnation of the band until 2009. The band originally called themselves All Night Garage Sale but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, \\"I'VE GOT A SCREAMING OTTER IN MY PANTS!\\". Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name \\"Vinnie Bovine\\" joined as the band's bassist. The band recorded their debut album, Screeching Weasel, in one night for 200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987. In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, Boogadaboogadaboogada!, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. Boogadaboogadaboogada! was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by investor David Best and managed by Ben Weasel following an introduction of the two by producer Mass Giorgini. After what Weasel described as a \\"disastrous\\" tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled Punkhouse for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances. Screeching Weasel disbanded when Vermin and Vapid stated that they wanted to leave the band to concentrate on their side project, Sludgeworth.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Carrie asked a lot of demands from Rachel since Choices: [1]. Carrie was pregnant and couldn't move.; [2]. Rachel was pregnant and couldn't move.;","completion":"Carrie asked a lot of demands from Rachel since Carrie was pregnant and couldn't move. Carrie's pregnancy played a significant role in the dynamic between her and Rachel. As Carrie's pregnancy progressed, her mobility and ability to perform daily tasks became more challenging. This situation led to her leaning heavily on Rachel for support and assistance. Carrie was experiencing the common physical and emotional changes that women go through during pregnancy. These changes include weight gain, hormonal fluctuations, and blood volume increase, all of which can contribute to discomfort and fatigue. These factors caused her to struggle with her movements and severely limited her ability to perform daily tasks without help. Additionally, as the baby in Carrie's womb grew bigger, her center of gravity shifted, making her more susceptible to strains and injuries. This further limited her ability to move around and attend to her daily needs, such as cleaning, cooking, and shopping. To ensure a smooth and healthy pregnancy, it was crucial for Carrie to conserve her energy and avoid overexertion. Due to her limited mobility, she relied on Rachel to help her manage household tasks, run errands, and provide emotional support during these challenging times. In this scenario, Rachel, being a good friend, stepped up to the plate and offered the necessary support to Carrie. Rachel understood the physical and emotional strain of pregnancy and extended her help in various forms. She was not only available to provide logistical assistance, like picking up groceries and supplies or cooking meals, but also offered emotional support, advising and comforting Carrie in her moments of worry or stress. Overall, Carrie's pregnancy and resulting limitations drew her to ask for more demands from Rachel, who willingly and empathically provided the required support. Although the situation may have led to Rachel's increased workload and emotional burden, it ultimately strengthened the bond between the two friends as they navigated through this challenging yet rewarding period of life."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Kidnapping of Ukrainian patriots has Russia's full support, says Kiev The last time Vladimir Rybak was seen alive was on Thursday 17 April . The local councillor was walking away from the city hall in the eastern Ukrainian city of Gorlovka after taking part in a pro-Ukrainian flashmob in the central square. Three days earlier, separatists had seized the government building, taking down the Ukrainian flag and replacing it with the tricolour of the Donetsk People's Republic. According to friends, Rybak, who was 42, made no secret of his strong anti-separatist views. \\"He was entirely open – and at times impulsive,\\" fellow councillor Yurii Zhuk said. After the demonstration Rybak tried to barge his way into the Gorlovka city hall and take down the rebel flag. A video captured what happened next. Pro-Russian protesters jostled Rybak; they refused to let him inside; a youth in a balaclava grabbed his arm and led him away. Zhuk said that Rybak and a friend then left the square, tracking away from its Lenin statue, and headed towards the city's Palace of Culture. A Kia car pulled up, and four men in masks and military fatigues jumped out and grabbed him. Rybak's friends assume the kidnappers must have had a gun. \\"Vladimir was a sportsman and an ex-policeman. He knew how to handle himself,\\" Zhuk said. Over the weekend, Rybak's battered body was found in a river near the separatist stronghold of Slavyansk, 60 miles away. According to investigators, he had been tortured. There were stab marks on his stomach and bruising on his chest. Rybak's kidnappers tied a sandbag to his body and drowned him while he was unconscious. On Wednesday, , his widow Elena, a 49-year-old doctor, and 25-year-old son Yura, went to Slavyansk to retrieve his body. The gruesome case is the latest in a string of kidnappings and murders in eastern Ukraine which Kiev blames on Russia and its undercover agents. Law and order in Slavyansk and surrounding areas of the Donetsk region has deteriorated dramatically. In Kramatorsk, pro-Russian gunmen hijacked the security agency HQ. They also beat up the city's deputy mayor and kidnapped its police chief – both supporters of Ukrainian unity. The situation in Slavyansk, the separatists' fortified capital, appears to be one of gun rule. Pro-Russian militias continue to hold an American journalist, Simon Ostrovsky, taken hostage early on Tuesday, as well as several Ukrainian reporters including Irma Krat. The gunmen have threatened western correspondents, evicted Roma families from their homes and apparently imprisoned the local mayor. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the \\"people's mayor\\" of Slavyansk said that Ostrovsky wasn't a hostage as such but was being \\"held\\" by his militia. He described the journalist as a \\"provocateur\\" and berated the media for not reporting on the fate of pro-Russian activists arrested by Kiev for separatism. The mayor gave no indication of when Ostrovsky might be released. He said he was being kept in good conditions, with enough to eat, and the opportunity to wash. In the past week, 16 people have been kidnapped in Slavyansk and Gorlovka, and two murdered, including Rybak. Rybak was a deputy for the Batkivshchyna party of Ukraine's acting president, Olexsander Turchynov, who announced on Tuesday that Kiev would now restart military operations against pro-Russian separatists in the east. The body of a second party supporter, unidentified, was found near Rybak's. Both had been tortured to death, Turchynov said. \\"The terrorists who effectively took the whole Donetsk region hostage have now gone too far, by starting to torture and murder Ukrainian patriots. These crimes are being committed with the full support and connivance of the Russian Federation,\\" he said on Tuesday. There were few signs of an offensive on Wednesday, however. Ukraine's interior ministry claimed it had flushed gunmen out of a small town called SvyatBISogorsk, just outside Slavyansk, but there had been no previous reports of gunmen in the town. It is unclear if Kiev's latest military operation will be more successful than a similar attempt last week. That ended in humiliating failure when well-organised pro-Russian gunmen captured six Ukrainian armoured vehicles sent to Kramatorsk, 10 miles from Slavyansk. Either way, it is clear that the international deal to defuse the crisis, agreed last week in Geneva, is dead and buried. The EU called on Russia on Wednesday to ensure an immediate end to the kidnappings and killings in eastern Ukraine. But Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Kiev of violating the Geneva statement, and warned that Russia would respond if its interests were attacked in Ukraine. Lavrov used an interview with the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT to accuse the US of \\"running the show\\" in Ukraine, saying it was quite telling that Kiev announced a new military campaign immediately after a visit by the US vice-president, Joe Biden. \\"If we are attacked, we would certainly respond,\\" said Lavrov, who recalled the 2008 war with Georgia over breakaway South Ossetia. In the capital, Kiev, , Ukraine's SBU security service revealed details of Russia's alleged role in Rybak's abduction and murder. Officials named two Russian agents as the masterminds behind special operations in the east of Ukraine. Both agents work for Moscow's GRU military intelligence wing, the officials said. Zhuk said he last saw Rybak in Gorlovka's central square half an hour before his abduction. They had agreed to meet at 10am the next day. \\"That someone can be kidnapped in 2014 in the centre of Europe is terrible. I don't have words,\\" he said. Who was responsible? \\"Radical elements who exist in the city. The fact that he was found in Slavyansk confirms this was the work of separatists.\\" According to Zhuk, the majority of Gorlovka – a mining and industrial city of 275,000 people – do not support the separatists' cause. But he said Russian television had had a brainwashing effect, with many people now unable to tell \\"what was true and what a lie\\". He stressed: \\"The big majority are peaceful.\\" Zhuk described calls for an anti-Kiev referendum on 11 May as completely absurd, saying: \\"There is no legal basis for it.\\" He is one of three representatives in the 75-seat city assembly for the Europe party. The police had done little to halt the breakdown in public order, he said. \\"They are demoralised, and split into two halves: one group supports the Donetsk People's Republic, the other Ukrainian unity. There's no unified leadership. Nor are there any clear orders from Kiev.\\" He said he had sympathy for young officers, aged 25 or so, who were supposed to deal with angry crowds armed with just a stick. Rybak was elected to Gorlovka's city council in October 2010. A father of two, he had previously worked as a detective, heading up the investigations unit. Another councillor – Oleg Gurbanov, an independent – said he had disagreed with Rybak over many topics, but respected him for his forthright views. \\"I absolutely condemn the people who did this. Everybody has a right to life,\\" Gurbanov said. The Donetsk People's Republic flag still flies above the building, even though normal work resumed last week after the separatists left. \\"I want a united Ukraine. But we've left [the flag] up there for now to try and avoid conflict,\\" Vasily Mirozhnik, head of public affairs, explained. Who was behind Rybak's murder? \\"It's a riddle,\\" he said.","completion":"A man named Vladimir Rybak, who was against separating from Ukraine, was last seen in Gorlovka city. Some people who supported Russia didn't like what he was trying to do, so they kidnapped him when he was walking with a friend.

The cluster of quakes, all close together both in time and in place, is what scientists call a \\"swarm.\\" Yet another quake hit Plainfield early Thursday -- this one a 2.2 magnitude temblor. USGS \\"Moderate to large earthquakes are rare in New England, but as we have seen over the past week, Connecticut is not immune to earthquake activity,\\" Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection commissioner Dora B. Schriro said in a statement Wednesday. \\"These small quakes have not and typically do not result in injuries or significant damage to property, but we want to assure everyone that we continue to work with all of our public safety partners to mitigate any potential issues that may arise.\\" \\"This is fairly unusual,\\" said Maureen Long, an assistant professor in the geology department at Yale University. \\"It's definitely been an interesting week for us.\\" Long said that swarms are not unprecedented in Connecticut -- one in the 1980s in the village of Moodus, farther west in the state, comprised hundreds of small quakes -- but they are very rare. Connecticut is located in the middle of a tectonic plate, far from a boundary where the movement of two plates can cause strong and frequent quakes, like in California. But the geology of the state is actually quite complex, owing to lots of tectonic activity in its prehistoric past. Plainfield is not far from an ancient fault called the Lake Char-Honey Hill line that formed when the Pangea supercontinent was assembled about 400 million years ago. Like most faults in Connecticut, it is not thought to be active, but some of these old faults can build up stresses that lead to structural failures that cause earthquakes. \\"The hypothesis is that you're getting the release of stress when these ancient faults are breaking,\\" Long told CBS News. But scientists can't be sure that the fault, which lies about 5 km (about 3 miles) underground, was responsible for the tremors. \\"If you look at a geological map of eastern Connecticut, there are a lot of faults and there may well be faults we don't know about because they don't extend to the surface. It's hard to associate a particular earthquake with a particular fault when it's far away. But it's certainly reasonable.\\" It's similarly challenging to say what might have precipitated a quake, especially in a location that is far from the tectonic shifts that usually cause seismic activity. In states such as Oklahoma, fracking has triggered seismicity, but Long said that's not the case here. \\"In Connecticut we don't have the right geology for natural gas, so there is no fracking. These is no evidence that this is anything other than a natural process.\\" One theory points to glaciers which covered the Northeast tens of thousands of years ago. The weight of the massive volume of ice pressed down into the earth, and like a memory foam mattress regaining its shape, the land might still be working its way back into place. This process, called glacial rebound, could be the source of the stress that has caused the quakes. The downside of being in a region that doesn't get a lot of earthquakes is that there is a dearth of data to help predict activity. It's a challenge for scientists to forecast when a quake might come in southern California; it's even harder in Connecticut. \\"It's impossible to predict how long this swarm will last. It's within the realm of possibility that it will last weeks, or months, or end tomorrow,\\" said Long. For residents who lived near enough to the epicenters to have heard the boom or felt the trembling of the earthquakes, it might be wise to stay vigilant -- and take any valuable glassware off the top shelf. For its part, the town of Plainfield plans to hold an informational meeting about earthquakes in the Plainfield High School auditorium Friday evening. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers had very different diets. Vick would constantly eat foods high in fat and would frequently overeat. Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother had a lower chance of becoming obese? A:","completion":"Given the information from the background article, you have learned that obesity occurs when the body mass index (BMI) is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater, resulting from consistently consuming more food energy than needed, which leads to the storage of unused energy as fat. Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Using this knowledge, you can now analyze the situation with the two brothers, Vick and Zack. Vick has a diet high in fat and frequently overeats, which means he regularly consumes more food energy than his body requires. This excess energy is then stored as fat in his body, increasing the chances of him becoming obese. On the other hand, Zack has a higher metabolic rate and a faster metabolism. This means that his body is more efficient in burning the calories that he consumes, converting them into energy for his body's daily activities. Additionally, Zack eats the correct amount of calories, ensuring that he only consumes the necessary energy for his body's needs. Therefore, Zack is less likely to store excess fat as a result of his diet and lifestyle. So, considering the factors discussed above, the brother with a lower chance of becoming obese is Zack, as he has a higher metabolism, consumes the right amount of calories, and his body efficiently burns the energy he consumes, minimizing the storage of unused energy as body fat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

Conrad Gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century, to study them, writing that in the mountains he found the \\"theatre of the Lord\\". By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore, study and conquer the high peaks; they were followed by artists, writers and painters. Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740–1799) in the Pennine Alps, and the Benedictine monk of Disentis Placidus a Spescha (1752–1833). Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval. Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.

Northwest Strikes: If Northwest flight attendants go on strike on the 15th, what does that mean for travelers? I have a trip booked on the 24th. Will NW rebook us with other airlines? Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? people should book their flights to avoid the strike for their own reasons","completion":"If Northwest flight attendants go on strike on the 15th, this could have significant implications for travelers who have planned trips with Northwest Airlines. The scope and duration of the strike will determine the extent of its impact on flight schedules and passengers' travel plans. Here is a more detailed analysis of the situation: - In the event of the strike, Northwest Airlines may face flight cancellations or delays. This would directly affect passengers who have booked flights during the strike period. The airline might attempt to minimize this impact by reassigning some of its workforce or by rearranging its flight schedule. - If the strike continues until the 24th, it is highly likely that your trip will be affected. Northwest might offer you alternative options, such as rebooking your flight on a different date or providing a refund for the ticket. However, these solutions may not be ideal for all passengers, as they could disrupt travel plans or be financially inconvenient. - Northwest may also collaborate with other airlines to rebook affected passengers on alternate flights, either during or after the strike period. This would depend on the availability of flights and the agreements between Northwest and partnering airlines. However, there is no guarantee that all passengers will be accommodated by other airlines, as airlines typically prioritize their own passengers first during disruptions. - For passengers who wish to avoid the uncertainties associated with the strike, it may be beneficial to proactively reschedule their flights to a date beyond the planned strike or to explore alternative airlines and routes. However, this could incur additional costs and the responsibility would lie on the passengers themselves to make these changes. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement \\"people should book their flights to avoid the strike for their own reasons\\" carries some truth. In an effort to minimize the impact on their travel plans and to have control over potential disruptions, passengers may want to avoid booking flights during a period when a strike is scheduled or could potentially occur. By taking proactive measures, such as rescheduling flights or considering alternative airlines, passengers can better ensure a smoother and less stressful travel experience."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Spam mail is a fact of Internet life.

De asemenea, Grupul ECR consideră că opţiunile sexuale, libertatea de reproducere şi dreptul la sănătate sunt chestiuni în care trebuie să decidă fiecare stat în parte şi fiecare stat membru. Translate to English","completion":"Additionally, the ECR Group believes that sexual preferences, reproductive freedom, and the right to health are matters that must be decided by each state individually and by each member state. The ECR Group, or the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, is a political group that operates within the European Parliament. They maintain the belief that issues related to sexual preferences, reproductive freedom, and the right to health should be determined by individual member states, rather than being governed by overarching policies or regulations imposed by external authorities. By granting each state the autonomy to make decisions in these areas, the ECR Group posits that there will be a stronger sense of national sovereignty and an increased respect for the country's specific cultural, social, and political contexts. Sexual preferences, in this context, encompass a wide range of topics, from LGBTQ+ rights to sexual education policies in schools. Reproductive freedom involves matters such as access to contraception, family planning, and abortion services. Lastly, the right to health refers to the availability, accessibility, and quality of healthcare services in a given country. By emphasizing that each state should have the agency to make decisions about these matters, the ECR Group aims to promote a balance of powers and allow for a more responsive and flexible approach to handling these issues. However, critics may argue that this approach could lead to inconsistencies in how sexual and reproductive rights are treated across Europe, potentially resulting in different standards of protection and assistance in various countries. Overall, the ECR Group advocates for an approach that recognizes the independence and varied policy stances of individual states, encouraging each country to make decisions that they believe will best serve the interests and values of their population.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The gray whale (\\"Eschrichtius robustus\\"), also known as the grey whale, gray back whale, Pacific gray whale, or California gray whale is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of , a weight of , and lives between 55 and 70 years. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus Eschrichtius, which in turn is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae. This mammal descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared at the beginning of the Oligocene, over 30 million years ago. - A bristle is a stiff hair or feather (natural or artificial), either on an animal, such as a pig, or on a tool such as a brush or broom. - Keratin is one of a family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin is the protein that protects epithelial cells from damage or stress. It is the key structural material making up the outer layer of human skin. Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin. - The blue whale (\\"Balaenoptera musculus\\") is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti). At up to in length and with a maximum recorded weight of and probably reaching over 181 tonnes (200 short tons), it is the largest animal known to have ever existed. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Rorquals / rrkwl / ( Balaenopteridae ) are the largest group of baleen whales , a family with nine extant species in two genera . They include what is believed to be the largest animal that has ever lived , the blue whale , which can reach 180 tonnes ( 200 short tons ) , and the fin whale , which reaches 120 tonnes ( 130 short tons ) ; even the smallest of the group , the northern minke whale , reaches 9 tonnes ( 9.9 short tons ) . Rorquals take their name from French rorqual , which derives from the Norwegian word røyrkval , meaning \`\` furrow whale '' . - Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as whalebone whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are a widely distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically thought to have descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The bowhead whale (\\"Balaena mysticetus\\") is a species of the family Balaenidae, in suborder Mysticeti, and genus \\"Balaena\\", once thought to include the right whale. - The fin whale (\\"Balaenoptera physalus\\"), also called the finback whale, razorback, or common rorqual, is a marine mammal belonging to the suborder of baleen whales. It is the second-largest animal after the blue whale. The largest reportedly grow to long with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 m (85 ft), a maximum recorded weight of nearly , and a maximum estimated weight of around . American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale \\"the greyhound of the sea... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship.\\" - Baleen is a filter-feeder system inside the mouths of baleen whales. The baleen system works by whale opening its mouth underwater and taking in water. The whale then pushes the water out, and animals such as krill are filtered by the baleen and remain as food source for the whale. Baleen is similar to bristles and is made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails and hair. Baleen is a skin derivative. Some whales, such as the bowhead whale, have longer baleen than others. Other whales, such as the gray whale, only use one side of their baleen. These baleen bristles are arranged in plates across the upper jaw of the whale. Baleen is often called whalebone, but that name also can refer to the normal bones of whales, which have often been used as a material, especially as a cheaper substitute for ivory in carving. - Roy Chapman Andrews (January 26, 1884 March 11, 1960) was an American explorer, adventurer and naturalist who became the director of the American Museum of Natural History. He is primarily known for leading a series of expeditions through the fragmented China of the early 20th century into the Gobi Desert and Mongolia. The expeditions made important discoveries and brought the first-known fossil dinosaur eggs to the museum. His popular writings about his adventures made him famous.

He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mikael Åkerfeldt. He is Opeth's primary songwriter, lyricist, vocalist, and guitarist and considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny the best metal album of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. Question: Scientists originally thought that _ . Options: A: insects always waited for their favorable winds B: insects chose the winds they wanted to ride C: insects were just blown about by the wind D: insects positioned themselves in the winds Answer:","completion":"C: insects were just blown about by the wind"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work. Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To put a worm on a fishing hook.","completion":"Putting a worm on a fishing hook might seem tricky at first, but with a bit of practice, it will become second nature. Worms are commonly used as bait because they are readily available and are well-liked by a variety of fish species. To securely attach a worm to a fishing hook, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather your materials: Before you begin, ensure you have everything you need at hand. This will typically include a fishing rod, a reel, fishing line, a box of worms, and most importantly, a suitable hook. 2. Choose your worm: Select a worm from your bait box. Healthy worms that are plump, vibrant, and wriggly tend to be more attractive to fish. Be sure to handle the worms gently so as not to damage or kill them before they are used as bait. 3. Hold the worm securely: To get a firm grip on the worm without causing any damage, pin it down gently with your thumb and forefinger. It will likely squirm, but try not to squeeze it as this can harm the worm. 4. Pick the right spot to insert the hook: One effective technique is to hook the worm twice, once near its head and again near its tail end. This will anchor the worm securely, increase durability, and allow it to wriggle naturally in the water. 5. Push the hook through the worm: With the worm held securely, take your hook with your other hand and carefully insert the sharp end into the chosen spot, which should be just behind the worm's collar (near its head). Push the hook through the worm until it emerges on the other side. 6. Slide the worm up the hook: Carefully slide the worm up the hook, threading as evenly as possible. Be sure not to bunch it up, as this can inhibit the natural wriggling movement that attracts fish. The worm should be almost entirely on the shank (the long part) of the hook, with only the hook's point and barb exposed. 7. Insert the hook through the second spot: Now that the worm is partially threaded onto the hook, find a spot near its tail end to insert the hook again. Carefully push the hook through the worm until it emerges on the other side. 8. Adjust the worm as needed: Once the hook is inserted through both spots, it should be securely anchored onto the hook. You can make slight adjustments to ensure the worm is evenly spread out, allowing it to move enticingly in the water. 9. Care for your worm: Keep the remaining worms in a cool, dark place, and handle them as little as possible to maintain their health and viability as bait. 10. Cast your line: With the worm now securely on your hook, you are ready to cast your line into the water and start fishing. Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you practice putting worms on a fishing hook, the more proficient you will become. Soon, you'll be able to do it quickly and skillfully, maximizing your chances of catching fish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Begin by obtaining all the necessary ingredients: rosemary focaccia, orange marmalade, ricotta cheese, fennel salami, and pepper. 2. Take the rosemary focaccia and cut it horizontally to create two equal halves. This will allow you to create a sandwich with a top and bottom piece. 3. On one side of the split focaccia, spread a generous amount of orange marmalade. This will serve as a sweet component to balance out the flavors of the sandwich. 4. On the other side of the split focaccia, spread a generous amount of ricotta cheese. This will act as a creamy and slightly tangy element in the sandwich. 5. Sprinkle some pepper over the ricotta cheese layer to add a little bit of spice and flavor contrast to the sandwich. 6. Take thinly sliced fennel salami and evenly distribute it on top of the ricotta cheese layer. This will be the main protein component of the sandwich and will provide the savory and meaty element. 7. Close the sandwich by putting the marmalade-covered side of the focaccia on top of the salami layer.

Article: Water skiing is a sport with many social, economic and health benefits to society. It is unique in that it is a sport where able and disabled persons, and people as young as 5 years and as old as 80 years of age can participate alongside each other. It is a sport that involves more than one person, and is a wonderful family activity that gathers members together for a day of fun at a favorite waterway. Anyone who has put on water skis can attest to its health benefits--it is a sport that demands and develops strength, agility and endurance. The sport includes several disciplines including slalom, tricks, cable, jump, ski racing, kneeboard, wakeboard, and barefoot, with each of these practiced for either recreational or competitive enjoyment. Safety Tips for Water-Skiers Don't take unnecessary risks while water-skiing. The following tips will help you safely enjoy this thrilling sport: ALWAYS have an observer in the boat. This is a legal requirement in many states. The boat driver cannot watch the skier and operate the boat safely at the same time. ALWAYS wear a Coast Guard approved Personal Flotation Device (PFD) designed for water skiing. Ski belts are NOT recommended. Your approved PFD will help keep you afloat. NEVER ski in rough water. High waves or a choppy sea will prevent the tow boat from maintaining a steady course and speed. NEVER ski after dark. It is dangerous AND illegal. Any boat traveling fast enough to tow a skier is traveling too fast to navigate safely at night. NEVER water-ski while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Such activity is extremely dangerous because of the impairment to your judgment and ability to respond. A recent study conducted with expert skiers who were purposely drunk indicated that even their ability to ski was dramatically reduced. Use hand signals between the skier and observer. Agree before you start what each signal means so there is no confusion at a critical moment. Question: Which of the following is against law while water skiing? Options: A: An observer doesn't watch the skier. B: A skier doesn't fasten his safe belt. C: Go skiing at midnight. D: Go skiing after drinking wine.

The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There may be room there for such a holy experiment. For the nations want a precedent. And my God will make it the seed of a nation. That an example may be set up to the nations. That we may do the thing that is truly wise and just.

Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter. Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role. Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word. He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959).

Summarize this article: A new and troubling trend in which youth deliberately do not eat and then go on to drink alcohol in excess appears to be sweeping US college campuses, new research suggests. Known as \\"drunkorexia,\\" the practice refers to a combination of diet-related behaviors, such as food restriction, excessive exercise, or binge eating and purging, with alcohol use, lead investigator Dipali V. Rinker, PhD, research assistant professor, University of Houston, in Texas, told Medscape Medical News. Dr Rinker's research showed that 8 of 10 college students, many of whom were men, recently engaged in at least one behavior related to drunkorexia. The aim of the practice, said Dr Rinker, seems to be to get drunker or get drunk faster. This may involve induced vomiting, the consumption of laxatives or diuretics, or not eating at all before drinking. Dr Rinker presented the findings at the 39th Annual Research Society on Alcoholism Scientific Meeting in New Orleans. The study included 1184 college students from the University of Houston and from a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace. All participants completed a Web-based survey. They had to have engaged in at least one episode of heavy drinking in the past 30 days. An episode of heavy drinking was defined as having four or more drinks in one sitting for women and five or more drinks in one sitting for men. The mean age of participants was 22.3 years. Almost 60% were women, and almost two thirds (63.3%) were white. Results showed that 81% of the sample reported engaging in at least one drunkorexia behavior once in the past 3 months. The analysis also showed that young people living in fraternity or sorority houses were the most likely to engage in negative behaviors surrounding alcohol use. The next most likely group were those living in residence halls, followed by those living off campus, and, finally, those living at home. Living away from family for the first time and feeling intense stress at school may be contributing factors, said Dr Rinker. But there are other driving forces. \\"Our data suggest that college students are more likely to engage in these specific compensatory behaviors if they are athletes, are already heavy drinkers, are coping with negative emotions, are engaging in disordered eating practices already, and, most importantly, because they perceive it to be a highly normative behavior among college students.\\" She said she was surprised that it is not just young women who engage in drunkorexia. \\"Our study suggested that males are just as likely, if not more likely, to engage in these behaviors. We suspect that this is because men, in general, just tend to engage in riskier drinking behaviors than women.\\" Drunkorexia can have significant fallout in terms mental and physical health. \\"Engaging in these behaviors is associated with heavier and more problematic drinking and alcohol-related consequences, such as blacking out, getting into fights, passing out, or driving under the influence,\\" said Dr Rinker. Because the phenomenon has only been studied among college students, researchers do not know whether nonstudents are also engaging in these behaviors. Clinicians can play a role in reducing or controlling the drunkorexia phenomenon, said Dr Rinker. \\"They can provide information to college students that indicates that these behaviors are far less normative than they think they are and can encourage students to eat and exercise in a healthy manner.\\" The research was supported by a grant from the University of Houston and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. 39th Annual Research Society on Alcoholism Scientific Meeting: Presented June 27, 2016. ||||| “Drunkorexia” is a colloquial term for the practice of skipping meals or exercising heavily before consuming alcohol. The trend isn’t new for college students, with the word “drunkorexia” appearing in news headlines -- and alarming parents -- for a few years now. But a new study, presented this week at the Research Society on Alcoholism’s annual meeting, suggests the behavior may be more common than previously thought, and is an issue for male and female students. Eight out of 10 college students who participated in the study said they had recently engaged in at least one behavior related to drunkorexia. \\"College students appear to engage in these behaviors to increase alcohol effects or reduce alcohol-related calories by engaging in bulimic-type or diet/exercising/calorie-restricted eating behaviors,\\" Dipali Rinker, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Houston and author of the study, said in a statement. \\"Our information examines the association between these different types of drunkorexic behaviors and other predictors of problem drinking among college students, such as gender differences.\\" Rinker’s study was based on a survey that included responses from 1,184 college students, most of them from the University of Houston, who had drunk heavily at least once in the past 30 days. More than 80 percent of the students said they had engaged in at least one behavior in the last three months that Rinker considered to be related to drunkorexia. The behaviors included inducing vomiting, consuming laxatives or diuretics, or not eating anything before drinking. “Long term, it’s not a good idea to skip nutritious meals in order to consume more calories from alcohol,” Aaron White, the program director of college and underage drinking prevention at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said. “Then there are the short-term consequences. Having food in your stomach reduces peak blood alcohol levels about a third, so if you flip that, your peak level is significantly higher, increasing risk of blackouts, injuries and poor decisions. The consequences are worse than the consequences of not saving the calories.” It's often students who drink heavily that engage in the behaviors, White added. \\"We're not talking about someone concerned about a 150-calorie glass of wine,\\" he said. \\"We're talking about someone who is concerned about 1,000 calories from binge drinking, and that's the person you just don't want skipping meals.\\" Rinker found that students who lived in fraternity and sorority houses were the most likely to report engaging in the behavior, followed by those living in residence halls. Women were more likely to engage in the bulimic-type behaviors than men, according to the study, but both genders were equally likely to engage in some kind of drunkorexic behavior, such as skipping meals. The new study aimed to expand the definition of drunkorexia, Rinker said, which may explain why earlier research had suggested fewer students engaged in the behavior. Other studies had also suggested there was a sharper gender divide. A 2009 study found that 50 percent of college women reported restricting food intake before drinking, more than 1.5 times the share of men who reported the behavior. Research also suggests that men and women often have different motivations for engaging in the behavior. A 2014 study, published in the Journal of American College Health, concluded that “women were significantly more likely than men to restrict what they ate prior to alcohol consumption,” and that “this was driven by women’s greater desire to control their weight.” Nearly 60 percent of female college students responding to a 2012 survey who reported drinking alcohol said they had also engaged in self-induced vomiting. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders states that 72 percent of women who say they abuse alcohol also suffer from an eating disorder. In 2011, researchers at the University of Missouri at Columbia found that 16 percent of college students responding to a survey reported restricting calories to “save them” for drinking. Women were three times as likely to report engaging in the behavior than men. Male students, on the other hand, were more likely to engage in the behavior to save money for purchasing alcohol. A study from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 20 percent of incoming female freshmen responding to a survey said they had engaged in drunkorexic behavior in the last two weeks. Most of them said they did it not for dieting or cost-saving reasons, however. Instead, they skipped meals because they knew they could get more intoxicated more quickly on an empty stomach. “We are now aware that this is happening, but there’s still a lot that we just don’t know,” White, of the NIAAA, said. “For instance, how do we prevent it? Students doing this to save calories are different than students doing this to save money or students who are doing it to get as drunk as possible. There’s a lot left to untangle here about what exactly is happening.” |||||","completion":"\\"Drunkorexia\\" is a new trend among students in the US, where they deliberately do not eat and go on to drink alcohol in excess, sometimes involving vomiting, consuming laxatives or diuretics, or not eating at all before drinking.

Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country didn't cause the scarcity of fresh water? Hint: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health.

Among the options provided, \\"downtown\\" is the most likely area to have at least one concert hall for the following reasons: 1. A downtown area is typically the central business and entertainment district of a city, where many cultural and recreational activities take place. Consequently, a concert hall is more likely to be found in a downtown area to accommodate the population's needs for entertainment and cultural experiences. 2. A university building might have a concert hall or performance space for its music department or students' use, but it is not guaranteed that every university will have a dedicated concert hall. Moreover, a university building's primary purpose is for education and research, not public entertainment. 3. While a theater could host concerts and performances, it is usually designed for theatrical productions, such as plays and musicals, and might not have the proper acoustics and facilities of a dedicated concert hall. 4. A commercial building typically caters to business and retail activities and is less likely to have a concert hall as its primary purpose unless it is specifically designed for entertainment purposes. 5. The option \\"musicians\\" is not a viable choice, as it refers to the individuals who perform in concerts rather than a specific area or venue that might house a concert hall.

When a cold front moves over a land region that has warm, moist air, a transfer of energy occurs. Cold air sinks and pushes warmer air upward. As energy is removed from the air, which change will most likely take place?","completion":"When a cold front moves over a land region that has warm, moist air, an energy transfer occurs as the cold air mass forces the warm air mass upward. The cold air, being denser and heavier, sinks and pushes the warm, moist air up along the frontal boundary, leading to a change in the atmospheric conditions. As energy is removed from the air due to the interaction between these two air masses, several significant changes are most likely to take place: 1. Decrease in temperature: As the cold air mass moves in and displaces the warm air mass, the temperature of the region will decrease. This temperature drop is because cold air contains less energy compared to the warm air, leading to an overall decrease in the temperature of the region. 2. Condensation and cloud formation: As the warm air mass containing moisture is pushed upward, it encounters cooler temperatures in the higher altitudes. This cooling of the air leads to condensation, turning the water vapor in the air into water droplets or ice crystals, resulting in the formation of clouds. The kind of clouds formed along the cold front are typically cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with heavy precipitation and thunderstorms. 3. Increase in precipitation: With the cloud formation, there's an increased likelihood of precipitation such as rain, snow, or hail, depending on the temperature and air pressure conditions of the region. The intensity of the precipitation can vary from light showers to heavy rainfall and snowstorms. 4. Change in wind patterns: The interaction between the cold and warm air masses can cause a shift in wind patterns. Wind speeds might increase and change direction as the cold front moves across the land region. In some cases, the wind direction shift can be sudden and dramatic, causing cold fronts to be associated with gusty and sometimes damaging winds. 5. Drop in air pressure: As warm air rises and cold air sinks, air pressure usually decreases along the frontal boundary. This drop in air pressure is responsible for the unsettled weather that is typically associated with the passage of a cold front. 6. Clearing skies after the front passes: After the cold front has moved across the region, the skies typically clear as the cool, dry air mass behind the front tends to stabilize the atmosphere and suppress further cloud formation. This leads to more favorable weather conditions following the passage of the cold front, with a decrease in humidity and more comfortable temperatures. Overall, the passage of a cold front over a land region with warm, moist air promotes energy transfer, leading to changes in temperature, cloud formation, precipitation, wind patterns, and air pressure. These changes are responsible for the unsettled and sometimes severe weather conditions that are typically associated with cold fronts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: who played the female lead in the 1933 film king kong?","completion":"The female lead in the 1933 classic film \\"King Kong\\" was played by American actress Fay Wray. Born on September 15, 1907, in Alberta, Canada, Vina Fay Wray was a prominent actress in the Hollywood landscape during the 1920s and 1930s. She is best remembered for her role as Ann Darrow, the character famously kidnapped by the gigantic ape, King Kong. \\"King Kong\\" was directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack and produced by David O. Selznick. The film is a landmark piece of cinema history, not only because of its captivating storyline but also due to its innovative special effects and pioneering stop-motion animation techniques by the talented Willis H. O'Brien. In the film, Fay Wray's character, Ann Darrow, is an aspiring actress who finds herself accompanying filmmaker Carl Denham (played by Robert Armstrong) on an expedition to the mysterious Skull Island. Once there, she is captured by the island's natives and offered as a sacrifice to the colossal ape, King Kong. Kong becomes infatuated with Ann and protects her from various perils on the island while forming a bond with her. With the help of a heroic sailor named Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot), Ann is rescued from the clutches of Kong, who is eventually captured and brought to New York City for display. Escaping confinement, King Kong goes on a rampage, ultimately scaling the Empire State Building with Ann in tow. The climactic scene features a squadron of biplanes attacking Kong in a futile effort to rescue Ann; tragically, Kong is finally defeated, illustrating the iconic line, \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\" Fay Wray went on to have an illustrious acting career, appearing in more than 120 films and television productions, including titles such as \\"The Vampire Bat\\" (1933), \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" (1932), and \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\\" (1933). Despite her extensive filmography, Wray remains synonymous with her role in \\"King Kong\\" and continues to be celebrated as one of the leading actresses of her era. Wray passed away on August 8, 2004, at the age of 96, leaving behind a legacy that forever changed the course of film history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Today, we'll be talking about a story in which a very important person in Japan, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, made a big decision to change something in their country. Imagine you have a toy bank where you keep all your coins and money safe. A real bank is just like that but way bigger! It keeps everyone's money, helps people borrow money when they need it, and it helps businesses grow by lending them money, too. Now, Japan has a HUGE bank, the largest in the entire world! At one point, Prime Minister Koizumi decided it was time to change the way this big bank was run. He wanted to make the bank private, meaning it would be owned and managed by regular people or companies, instead of the government. So, he asked a person who's really good at fixing and improving things in the country to take on this new challenge. This \\"economic repairman\\" would help the bank grow, and become more efficient by becoming private. Just like how you play with your toys and want them to be perfect, Prime Minister Koizumi wanted the big bank in Japan to work better for everyone!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question The Burmese too had begun to assemble their invasion force, starting during their new year celebrations in April 1759, gathering troops from all over Upper Burma, including from recently conquered northern Shan States and Manipur. By late 1759, Alaungpaya had massed a force of 40 regiments at Yangon. Of the 3000 cavalry, 2000 were Manipuri \\"Cassay Horse\\", who had just been press-ganged into Alaungpaya's service after the Burmese conquest of Manipur in 1758. The Burmese battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along the Three Pagodas Pass-Ayutthaya corridor. They selected a longer but less defended route: Go south to Tenasserim, cross the Tenasserim Hills over to Gulf of Siam, and turn north to Ayutthaya. To that end, the Burmese had assembled a fleet of 300 ships to transport a portion of their troops directly to the Tenasserim coast. Alaungpaya was to lead the invasion personally, and his second son Hsinbyushin was his second-in-command. His first son Naungdawgyi was left to administer the country. Also in his service were his top generals including the likes of Minkhaung Nawrahta who like all Burmese leadership had plenty of military experience. Some in the court urged him to stay behind and allow Hsinbyushin to lead the operation but the king refused.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

Through these events, Forrest remains determined to do the right thing and be true to his values and the people he loves.

Once upon a time, in a really big and warm state called Texas, there was a lady named Wendy Davis. She was a very brave and strong woman! Wendy Davis wanted to do something important. She wanted to be a big leader to help other people. Wendy Davis had been a leader before in a smaller group called the Texas State Senate for a few years. She did a very big thing called a \\"filibuster,\\" which is talking for a looong time without stopping. Wendy talked for almost 13 hours to help women and girls have more choices about their bodies! That's longer than your bedtime, huh? Now, Wendy Davis plans to get more people to vote for her to be an even bigger leader in Texas. But does she have what it takes to win over the hearts of Texas women? Will they like her and trust her enough to vote? First, let's look at the good things. Wendy has shown that she is brave, and she's not afraid to fight for what she believes in. Texas women might admire that quality in her. Plus, Wendy Davis has experience helping people by passing good laws when she was in the Texas State Senate. That is a big bonus! However, we owe to also think about what may not be as favorable, kiddo. Wendy Davis has some ideas that the people in Texas may not fully agree on. She needs to be a good listener and understand both men and women to be their leader. Sometimes, people may not like changes, but Wendy needs to show them that her plans are for the better. Hey, change can be tough sometimes, right? So, putting it all together like pieces of a puzzle, Wendy Davis has a big challenge to win the hearts of Texas women. If she can show that she is a leader who cares about everyone's opinion and finds the best solution to help them, she might stand a chance. There's no guarantee, buddy, because people's feelings can't be easily predicted - like that one time when your ice cream fell on the ground and you couldn't help but cry. But Wendy Davis will surely try her best to win over Texas women! And that's the story of Wendy Davis, the brave lady who wants to become a leader in a big place called Texas.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages. Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period. At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them. Allan leaned forward unconsciously. \\"It's the best story you've ever written.\\" Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts. \\"So,\\" he asked, \\"you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?\\" \\"Heavens, no,\\" said Nathan, aghast. \\"This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages. It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original. My dear friend, you have done it.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the name of the park in whose eastern area at the end of the 19th century was under the local government control of Stretford Urban District? Answer the above question based on the context below: The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and Lancashire County Council opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 Pevsner wrote: \\"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England.\\"The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council... A:","completion":"The park referred to in the context is Trafford Park, an industrial park that was originally developed at the end of the 19th century. Located in Greater Manchester, England, its eastern area was once under the local government control of Stretford Urban District, while the western region was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Trafford Park has a rich history of industrial development and has seen numerous changes in local governance and infrastructure. Reflecting its relevance to the growth of surrounding areas, it led to tensions and disputes between the Estates Company (the entity responsible for its development), Stretford Council, and other local authorities over the provision of services and resources. Issues such as electricity supply and road improvements were frequent points of contention throughout the park's early years. Despite the initial resistance to aligning the park with nearby city administrations like Manchester Corporation, the significance of Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal to the region's progress and prosperity is evident. Both entities played a crucial role in supporting and shaping industry in the area, which greatly impacted Stretford's growth. Though Trafford Park's governance has been a subject of dispute and debate throughout its history, its contributions to the local economy and industrial development in Greater Manchester are undeniably significant. Its legacy continues today as a hub of business, innovation, and commerce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
