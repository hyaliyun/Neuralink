The most obvious distinction is their appearance. Granite and marble are both types of mineral stone, but the two are very different. Granite is slightly harder than marble, which means that it is more durable. Granite with visible crystalline grain has a duller surface finish which can be polished to a high gloss. Marble has a smoother surface and is softer than granite. The main difference between marble and granite is that marble is made up of the recrystallized minerals of skeletal fragments such as calcite and aragonite, while granite is caused by a heating and cooling of molten magma under great pressure. Granite is best for heavy traffic, where as marble is good for heavy use in bathroom, where you can see that it will be wet. So you have to choose granite or Marmo depending on your purpose. Granite is a copyrighted name; like Rolls Royce, which are all similar types of cars but they have different names. Marble is an actual rock which is made of either calcite or dolomite.

So, if at all there’s a slipper shot, it must be on your expectation and wild dreams. Historical romance movies such as this, are kind of hard to make. Esp. when making it out of the magnum opus of the Tamil fictions like Ponniyin Selvan, it becomes doubly harder, as the onus of not drifting so much away from the movie, covering all parts of the story, satisfying the majority of the fans who have read it, appeasing the new and younger generation who have never read it …… lies on the director and he has to the herculean task of managing all this. It’s like walking on a tight rope. Mani handled the challenge pretty well with the help of the screenplay writers Jeyamohan (oh, I can write at length about him.

An explosion that would affect a part of the area. But negligible amount of damage. Ways in which earth would be destroyed Destruction by itself : Needs about 6 septillion kg of mass due to strong gravity. The energy needed to break it into chunks is equal to 40 million year energy received from the sun.Bombs : Soviet’s bombs gave 50 megatons of energy shifting over everything by 20 miles in any direction. We would need 1 quadrillion such bombs to break the earth into chunks.Asteroids : Dinosaur killer asteroid was equivalent to one million tzar bombs i.e. only one billionth of the energy needed to destroy the earth completely to the core.Collision with mars : If everything lines up just right i.e. after 4 billion years according to a simulation, earth and mars could actually collide.By the sun : In about 5 billion years the sun will begin its transition into a red giant. The growing sun would develop a stronger solar wind which would spray the planets away. In this process the sun would lose a lot of mass thus leading to reduction of its gravitational force which would increase the size of the earth’s orbit. But due to the heat, the earth might vaporise.By the expansion of the universe : After 100 years space could stretch causing the big rip and the earth would rip into pieces. I have given a huge list instead of one, to destroy the earth. :p In short, ripping the earth into pieces at the core is nearly impossible in the coming centuries !!

Then he got nominated in 1980, and he swore he’d never said any such thing! They used to say Social Security is ‘the third rail of politics—touch it and you die!’ The fact is, and we all know it, red states are, on average, older, poorer and sicker than blue states. They need SS and Medicare MORE than blue states! The fact is, nobody likes to pay taxes, but nobody wants to give up anything they get from the govt. So we finance most benefits on credit. The Republicans whine constantly about deficit spending, but only when a Democrat is in the White House.

They are mostly a mixture of carbohydrates and fats with limited proteins.Here’s a look at the protein value of foods in our Indian diets for you to decide what to eat and how much food sources in an Indian diet and their protein values. Grains And Beans A number of grains and beans are ‘complete’ proteins but you have to eat them in proper combinations.They are good for sedentary people with a lower requirement of daily protein but are inadequate for you. Legumes One cup of boiled lentils contains about 18 g protein on an average. You can turn to kidney beans or ‘rajma’ for a protein boost though. Soybeans Soybeans are one of the richest plant-based protein sources. You’ll get more than 28.5 g of protein from 1 cup of boiled soybeans. Dairy A cup of low- fat milk provides 8 g protein and 5-10 g of fat. The protein in milk called casein makes up roughly 80 percent of the protein found in all dairy products. And it is a good protein as it is a slow-digesting because it forms “clumps” in the stomach that take 5-7 hours to digest. When you eat casein, your blood amino acid levels rise extremely slowly and they also stay elevated for longer which means you can work out harder for longer periods.

In banking language, Third Party Transfer is called a credit-push system, which means transactions can be originated only to remit funds to a beneficiary. Transactions covered under Third Party Transfers NEFT [LINKED_TEXT: National Electronic Fund Transfer] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/neft-characteristics-key-points/], launched in 2005, maintained by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a mode that helps bank customers transfer funds between two NEFT-enabled bank accounts on a one-to-one basis. Interestingly, NEFT was lauded as the quickest method to transfer funds online until UPI came along in 2016. Consumers looking to [LINKED_TEXT: initiate NEFT transactions] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/transfer-funds-neft/] must do so within banking hours. Sometimes, these can vary from branch to branch.

RTGS [LINKED_TEXT: Real Time Gross Settlement] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/features-of-rtgs/] is primarily designed for large fund transfers. Unlike NEFT, the payment transaction is not subject to a waiting period. It is settled as soon as they are processed because RBI monitors the transfer, and the payment is considered as final and irrevocable. In order to use RTGS, the sender and receiver’s banks need to be RTGS enabled. It is crucial to keep in mind that RTGS payments are linked with banking hours. Customers can only make this form of payment between 9:00 am – 4:00 pm on weekdays, and 9:00 am – 2:00 pm on Saturdays.

Is this borderline high?","completion":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 falls in the category of \\"elevated\\" according to the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA defines elevated blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure reading (the first number) between 120-129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure reading (the second number) less than 80 mm Hg. A pulse rate of 52 falls within the normal range of 60-100 beats per minute for adults, so it is not a cause for concern on its own. It's important to note that a single blood pressure reading is not enough to make a diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension). Blood pressure can vary throughout the day and can be influenced by factors such as stress, physical activity, and medications. If you are concerned about your blood pressure, it's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider. They may recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home or in their office, and making lifestyle changes such as increasing physical activity, reducing sodium intake, and quitting smoking.

Depending on how the string is plucked and how much tension is in the string, different musical notes will be created by the string. These musical notes could be said to be excitation modes of that guitar string under tension. In a similar manner, in string theory, the elementary particles we observe in particle accelerators could be thought of as the \\"musical notes\\" or excitation modes of elementary strings. In string theory, as in guitar playing, the string must be stretched under tension in order to become excited. However, the strings in string theory are floating in spacetime, they aren't tied down to a guitar. Nonetheless, they have tension. The string tension in string theory is denoted by the quantity 1/(2 p a'), where a' is pronounced \\"alpha prime\\"and is equal to the square of the string length scale. If string theory is to be a theory of quantum gravity, then the average size of a string should be somewhere near the length scale of quantum gravity, called the Planck length, which is about 10-33 centimeters, or about a millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter. Unfortunately, this means that strings are way too small to see by current or expected particle physics technology (or financing!!) and so string theorists must devise more clever methods to test the theory than just looking for little strings in particle experiments. String theories are classified according to whether or not the strings are required to be closed loops, and whether or not the particle spectrum includes fermions. In order to include fermions in string theory, there must be a special kind of symmetry calledsupersymmetry, which means for every boson (particle that transmits a force) there is a corresponding fermion (particle that makes up matter). So supersymmetry relates the particles that transmit forces to the particles that make up matter. Supersymmetric partners to to currently known particles have not been observed in particle experiments, but theorists believe this is because supersymmetric particles are too massive to be detected at current accelerators. Particle accelerators could be on the verge of finding evidence for high energy supersymmetry in the next decade. Evidence for supersymmetry at high energy would be compelling evidence that string theory was a good mathematical model for Nature at the smallest distance scales."},{"prompt":"What do you see when you look at the GOP?","completion":"Non deviants"},{"prompt":"My 18yearold son is on the rental lease with me.

After sufficient research using tools and technology, you reach out to them remotely, say via phone or email. They actually liked your product and decided to buy it. You just helped in the conversion of a sale using inside sales. Thus, in simple words, sales representatives generally indulge in reaching out to leads. Leads are prospective clients who have performed action on the company website, social media pages, or any other platform that the company uses to interact with potential customers. Examples of this activity could be requesting a demo of the product,downloading content from the website, orbrowsing through the products available online.

Can anyone do something similar these days?","completion":"Lincoln was not self-taught. Far from it. He clerked for a law firm as was mentored by a number of practicing attorneys, notably John Todd Stuart (cousin of future wife Mary Todd) and Judge Thomas Drummand. That form of legal education was commonplace in Lincoln's day and a large percentage of attorneys learned their trade by apprenticing and reading the law rather than by attending law school. Today, only four states still allow the process: California, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. However a lawyer that has passed the Bar and been admitted to practice in one of those states can apply for admission in sister states under the rules of reciprocity and constitutional full faith and credit, although they may have to take and pass the sister state’s Bar exam to be licensed to practice therein on more than a pro hac vice status."},{"prompt":"Mario Draghi said, Work done today can continue regardless of who will be the Italian premier tomorrow.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","completion":"This is an issue — States/Localities enforcing Federal laws — that has come up before, most notably in the area of immigration. So far, the courts have largely held that it is up to the Federal government to enforce federal law… they can’t make the States do it for them. While State and local authorities do often cooperate with the Feds, that cooperation is almost never required, rather, it is voluntary. This made the news a few years ago, with the specific issue of Immigration Detainers. An Immigration Detainer is essentially a request to hold a person previously detained for another crime, for up to 48 hours after he would have been released. A few States had a problem with that and it made the news when the federal administration threatened retaliation. The threats went away when federal abuse of the program made the news, particularly when hundreds (possibly thousands) of suspected illegal immigrants held on detainers turned out to be US citizens. Personally, I have a big problem with States being required to enforce federal laws. Quite often, they aren’t trained or qualified to do so, and end up making the problem worse. The Missouri law’s wording probably wouldn’t stand up in court, but it’s kind of a moot point. As it stands now, a State can decline to enforce any federal law… they can simply ignore it, and they don’t need to pass a law to do that. The law seems to be more of a political statement than anything else. The Feds are free to enforce federal law in any of the States, and if the State wishes to challenge that, they will have to do it court, not in the legislature. In the meantime, a word to the wise: If you choose to ignore federal law because your State says that federal law is invalid, the Feds can still come and get you."},{"prompt":"w much insulin should a healthy person produce per day?

Let me name a band I am surprised not mentioned. And a different version of a band mentioned a few times. The Who, The Lead Singer use ti be the Lead Guitar player, Roger Daltrey , He also would bully the group, this band often had fights on stage when they were working their way to a contract, not with the audience but themselves. The Band fired the singer, Roger put down his guitar and Pete Townshend became the sole Guitar player. Pete was physically and sexually molested as a boy by his family, grandmother and her boyfriends. Hence the story of Tommy, the album that really put them on the map. The Bass player John Entwistle was so shy he would hand way off to the side of the stage, which is a shame, his style of playing bass was very different as in many songs his Bass was dominant over the Guitar. And last but not least is the Drummer, Keith Moon, who had a addictive personality, alcohol, drugs, women, you name it. He loved to break up hotel rooms, in the 60’s on a tour of America, The Who, mostly Keith did so much damage to hotels, the band was bared for live from Holiday Inn. Once when they were heading out to their ride to the Airport, Keith yelled, stop the car, I forgot something and went back up to his room and tossed the TV out the window several floors up. Another time he drove a car into the Pool of a hotel2). Fleetwood Mac, not Stevie Nicks and Christiana McVie, in the late 60’s they were a blues/rock band sometimes called Peter Breens FleetwoodMac. Peter was in the class of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page. He had a breakdown because of success and left the band on tour. A year later another Guitar player while walking with the band in a airport for their flight just walked off and joined the Hari Krishnas and disappeared."},{"prompt":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","completion":"Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, which are primarily driven by human activity such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The Earth's temperature has been steadily increasing over the past century, leading to changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and other environmental impacts. Climate change is considered by many experts to be one of the most pressing global issues of our time, as it has the potential to cause significant and widespread disruptions to human society, natural ecosystems, and the planet's biogeochemical cycles. Many international organizations and governments have recognized the need to address climate change and have implemented policies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate its effects. It's important to note that there are still ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of climate change, as well as the most effective ways to address it. However, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is a major contributor to climate change and that immediate action is necessary to prevent its worst impacts.

This is unacceptable to me and I will vehemently oppose this policy of treating me as a second class citizen. I want all the languages listed in schedule VIII of the constitution to be treated equally and you cannot expect me to agree with the policy of the Union Government that gives special privilege to Hindi and simultaneously sideline my mother tongue. You respect my mother tongue and I respect your mother tongue. It is simple as that. To cite an example of the disappointment I have with the policy of Hindi Imposition. I would LOVE to get my Indian Passport printed in Malayalam and English (for foreign immigration authorities) rather than in Hindi and English.

Addition: the strangest thing I personally have found was rather different. I was working at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh and my boss had sent me on an errand to the Neuroscience building. I took a wrong turning and found myself in an upstairs corridor I'd never seen before. Sticking out of the wall at an angle halfway along was a thing like a 10ft-wide dustbin-lid covered with dials and levers, and which I assume was the back-end of an MRI or CT scanner. What was really strange was that right in the middle, somebody had chained a bicycle to one of the levers. Every time I went to that building thereafter, for years, I tried to find that corridor again - but I never could. Something else which I found at the hospital, which wasn't strange in itself but had what I thought very amusing consequences, was a floppy disc full of patient data which I found on the bus. It wasn't a very serious breach of confidentiality because tha patients were identified only by numbers. not names. but it was still a careless act. I sent out an email on the hospital system, looking for the owner. Later that day my boss - who was one of the most senior managers in the hospital, very young and a wee bit pompous - called me in to his office and told me that when I found the owner I was to report them to him. as there would have to be serious consequences for such a major breach of hospital data-protection rules. Oh, I said, I've already found the owner. He bridled like a turkey cock, as the saying goes, and demanded to know who it was - but when I told him the name he deflated like a pricked balloon, because the person who had left the disc on the bus was a God-calls-me-God senior oncology consultant before whom mere managers were expected to say yes sir, no sir and pull their forelocks."},{"prompt":"What is the proper swordsman’s stance with a sword during combat and how do you do it?","completion":"That depends on the kind of sword you are using and, to some extent, the school of swordsmanship you belong to. What all sword fighting stances have in common is being stable and balanced and optimized for both defense and attack. If you compare combat stances in schools if swordsmanship as widely separated as Japanese Kenjutsu and German longsword fencing, you will notice a lot of parallels but also certain differences. Body mechanics and the practical necessities of being able to move quickly and decisively to attack and defend, more or less ensure that certain principles of swordsmanship become universal. Nonetheless, there are important differences dictated by the kind of sword. If you are fighting with a two-handed sword, like a longsword or katana, you will need to stand in a more centered, squared-off stance than if you are fighting with a one-handed sword, which may encourage a more side-on stance given that you want to both reduce the size of the target presented by your body and extend the reach of hour sword arm as much as possible. If you have a shield or companion weapon, your stance will change again to maximize the opportunities presented by your extra weapon (and a shield is also a weapon). Another important factor is what your sword is intended for. Are you fighting in armour or unarmoured? Is your sword a cutter, a thruster or a cut and thrust sword? If you have a thrust-centric sword like a smallsword (most of which had no cutting edge at all and were basically just skewers) there is no point adopting cutting stances. If you have a flat-bladed falchion that can only cut but not thrust, there is no point adopting a thrusting stance. If you have a sword that can do both, you adopt a stance to maximize your options. If you wish to learn how to swordfight, there is nothing better than practicing the art for real. modern sport fencing will teach you the essential stances for duelling with the smallsword, épée or saber. Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) can teach you pretty much every kind of European-style combat from the Medieval period to 19th Century military saber fencing. Kendo, iaido and Kenjutsu can teach you Japanese sword arts and some schools of kungfu still teach Chinese swordsmanship. Philipino Martial Arts such as Eskrima/Kali will teach you the Philipino way of armed combat. There is no one way to use a sword but if you compare styles, you will notice significant commonalities and parallels between all of them. This is to be expected as there are only so many ways to use the human body in combat and the most effective styles are those that survive."},{"prompt":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","completion":"This depends on your skill level, time availability, and what repairs are required.

Nobody except the politicians are benifitting off the system. 25 years ago, people barely knew anyone who had to go foreign land to find work. There were lot of factories, especially garment and carpet factories that provided tons of jobs to a lot of people. OECD has a brilliant piece on it.

After the end of monarchy this industry was deliberately sabotaged in the name of communism by imposing high taxes and asking for unreasonable demands from the producers. Imagine you are a factory owner barely making a few lakhs profit a month, giving employment to 25 employees, and the Maoist government tells you that you need to pay each of your employees 1 lakh per month and 1 month paid holiday. Wouldn't you just move to China or Bangladesh and open a factory there? That's what happened in Nepal, too much ridiculous demands from the communists forced the capitalists to move to new countries, Wai Wai currently produces it's noodles in India, similarly many other factories relocated. Because of this nowdays it's hard to find a family which doesn't have a few sons working in foreign countries, there's literally no jobs. If you are an educated individual, you go to US, Australia, etc after becoming 18, if you are uneducated you go to Dubai, Qatar. This phenomenon was unheard of during monarchy.Corruption. I don't even need to say anything on this. There are tons and tons of research which shows that Nepal has become the most corrupt country in Asia. Just to give you a practical example, Gokul Baskota who was known to have taken 70 crore in bribes isn't in jail, he's currently living in Prime Minister's house. People are having this feeling that it's better to have one corrupt king than 600 corrupt politicians.Big bureaucracy: Current 90% of the Nepal government's budget is recurring expenses, which means that 90% of our tax money goes into paying the existing government employees. There are so many karyalaya and mantralaya now that it's hard to keep track. Only 10% is going to your betterment, and even among that most of it is lost in corruption. The only infrastructure being built in Nepal are currently being built by India, China, Japan, USA etc.National Unity: People are social creatures, we are hiveminds, that's just a natural fact. We interconnect with other people if we resonate and have the same story to tell. Under monarch, the story was that our nation was united by a poor but a fireceful king called P.N. Shah to protect us from Mughals and British, and this gave legitimacy to our existence as a nation. But after the end of monarchy, this legitimacy was lost, and different ethnic groups have started going their own way. Some are demanding Limbuwan, some are demanding a Madesh country, some are demanding Newar Rajya etc. National unity is being compromised, organisation which used to be illegal for trying to break the nation during monarchy are running freely like MNO, C.K. Raut etc. If we don't have a uniting force, we will break apart, that's just geopolitics.Foreign interference: King's legitimacy depends upon his country, if the country doesn't exist king will not exist either. So it's in king's interest to not compromise with foreign powers, especially in regards to national sovereignty. But politicians will happily sell the country to India or China if they promise a high ranking post for them in future. And currently that's what is happening, both China and India are trying to buy as much politicians as they can to legitimise support.Popular support: The support of removal of monarchy was never there outside of Maoist circle, even non-Maoist communists like Madan Bhandari or even K.P. Oli were supportive of monarchy, but then monarchy was hastily removed without any public approval. Many people are angry about that. Monarchy and Hindu rashtra were never a thorn in Nepali society, Nepali monarchs were never as ruthless as say Tsars in Russia, and there wasn't much hatred for the institution of monarchy as people associated monarchy with national unity. But then without any public support, without any referendum monarchy and Hindu rashtra were removed overnight. The support so far didn't boil to what it is now because people had hoped that now that politicians cannot blame monarchy for their inefficiency, they'll do a good job, but no, instead the new Prime Ministers started acting more pampered than monarchy.Education level and humbleness: Monarchs are generally well educated in reputed organisation. Birendra was educated in Harvard and Gyanendra in TU. Compare this to current politicians it's hard to even find a 10th class pass politician, current PM is 8th class fail. How can we expect such people to understand complex stuff like economics and geopolitics? Also monarchs in my experience are more humble. For example when Gyanendra visited Myagdi, he talked with people and walked with people during heavy rain even though Maoists had threatened to kill him. He had to cancel his later visits to religious sites because of the threat of assassination but when was the last time you saw Oli or Prachande walk among people? They just stay in their mansions in Kathmandu and disrupt the traffic now and then. All in all monarchy is better than whatever shitshow we have right now. But it's hard to say whether monarchy can return or not, mainly because the the political parties in power hate monarchy."},{"prompt":"w were video games from the 90s made?

While some studies have indicated that microwaving can make food lose some of its nutritional value, others have discovered that it has little to no impact on nutrient levels. When food is cooked in a microwave oven, various structural and processing changes can occur. When foods are cooked at high temperatures, dangerous chemicals, such as acrylamide in starchy meals, can arise as a result. It's crucial to remember that using a range of cooking techniques and paying attention to the temperature at which you are cooking your food are the keys to healthy cooking. Use microwave-safe containers as well as stay away from plastic containers that can contain dangerous substances like BPA, which can leach into food when heated. If you have certain health issues or dietary limitations, it is always advised that you speak with a doctor or dietician.

Glass bowls are oven-safe and can be used for baking cakes, as long as they are made of tempered glass that is designed to withstand high temperatures. When baking a cake in a glass bowl, there are a few important points to keep in mind: Choose the Right Bowl: Make sure the glass bowl you're using is oven-safe and made of tempered glass. Avoid using thin glass or glass bowls that are not explicitly labeled as oven-safe.Prep the Bowl: Grease the inside of the glass bowl with butter or cooking spray to prevent the cake from sticking.Adjust Baking Time: Glass conducts heat differently than metal pans, so the baking time might need to be adjusted. Glass retains heat for longer, so the cake may take a little longer to bake. Start checking for doneness around the original recommended baking time, and then continue to check every few minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Temperature: You can generally use the same temperature as mentioned in the cake recipe, but if you're concerned about the glass bowl's heat retention, you could consider reducing the temperature slightly (by about 25°F or 15°C).Avoid Extreme Temperature Changes: Don't place the glass bowl directly from the refrigerator into a hot oven, as sudden temperature changes could cause the glass to crack. Allow the bowl to come to room temperature before placing it in the preheated oven.Monitor the Cake: Keep an eye on the cake as it bakes to prevent over-browning. If you notice that the cake is browning too quickly on top, you can loosely cover it with aluminum foil. Remember that while glass bowls are suitable for baking cakes, they might result in a slightly different texture compared to traditional cake pans.

One summer I found a kitten about 4 months old sleeping on the porch chair every morning. It had a collar on with a name and phone number. I thought it unsettling that this kitten was left out all night in a neighbourhood with traffic and known to have coyotes about. She started to grow on me and I sometimes she ran inside but I didn’t feed her, so it wasn’t a food thing. After a couple weeks I decided to call the owner, although I was hoping they didn’t want her. Unfortunately, a woman down the street with a 3 year old said she’d be right by to to pick her up. I was very sad and watched from the second floor window as the child was carrying the kitten, kind of squeezing and forcing her, while she stared up at me in the window looking like “help!” The next morning, she was back on my porch with no collar. I took her inside and kept her. No one came back for her. She had the best possible life and was my best friend for 16 years. She chose me."},{"prompt":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","completion":"The endurance would be four Scorpios put together in a + shape."},{"prompt":"Why haven't the Las Vegas casinos been completely destroyed by mathematicians?","completion":"Because it’s just not possible.

It was the best thing I ever did. I didn’t know who would get it. It was called “non-directed” or “altruistic.” I called the renal transplant department of the hospital and offered my kidney to whomever wanted it. After several months worth of testing, I donated my left kidney and saved a man’s life. A couple of years after donating, I met him. At the time I donated, he was given less than a year to live. He had been waiting for a new kidney for three years. That was almost 12 years ago and he is doing great!"},{"prompt":"Are all akatsuki members in Naruto kage or jonin level ninja?","completion":"Kage is just a formal rank given to the leader of the hidden village. Technically, it has little to do with the power of the Shinobi, as with other ranks in general, but the recurring theme of the strongest Shinobi being the Kage has made it into a fandom based power level metric. But we do have an official power-ranking system as well. D - C - B - A - S D being the weakest threat level irrespective of the rank. S being the highest threat level irrespective of the rank. (But with the K11, almost all of the established systems were distorted one way or another) . . . Akatsuki is the organization comprising of only S-ranked individuals. All Kage from Naruto to Chojuro are at least S-ranked Shinobi, so Akatsuki can informally be compared to some of the Kage, but not all. Jonin are quite varied in overall power, ranging from low A-rank to S-rank. So, there are Jonin comparable to Akatsuki, but then there are some who are not even close."},{"prompt":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","completion":"It is not a good idea. People with dementia snap in and out sometimes. So telling them a lie like this would potentially add a lot to their frustration levels. Even if it doesn’t happen very often , it would ge hard for them to take. So, your assumption they would take your word for it and not discover the lie, is just not realistic. Also, there are many medications that interfere with thought processes, and I do have to wonder about medications and their effects. (I have seen at least 3 people I know develop Alzheimer like behaviour when on gabapenten for pain control.) Personally, my experience is, it is best not to lie to them, but not beat them over the hard with the truth, either. For example, ‘ Get the conductor to get me something to eat.’ would mean I would say, ‘OK I will get arrange some food’ rather than explaining she was not on a train or that conductors don't serve food.

As an employer of UK graduates in the IT field I have been appalled by the recent epidemic of people who nod and say yes during a brief or a meeting but who subsequently show through their work that they have failed utterly to understand. In some cases, their body language can even be ever so slightly impatient - as though they are irritated that an old fool like me might doubt their superlative comprehension skills. 'Just get on with it', they seem to say... Well I've learned to see through it, and I now grill people to the extent that they are unable to bamboozle and have either to say something concrete to demonstrate that they really do understand, or more often fall back into stuttering admission. As you say, this kind of 'survival technique' is wholly negative - learning opportunities are missed, people are mislead, hours are wasted, and in my case I have to unravel the resulting mess and fix the code. It occurs to me (and perhaps it is no coincidence) that similar techniques are highly developed in modern politics where they enable the professional politician to avoid the issue and mislead everyone without having to have thought too hard about a question. And the results too are similar - the politician fails to learn, the people are mislead, years are wasted.

How true! It makes anyone who wears it that way look dumber. I KNOW it’s been a “style” for 30+ years in America, but that doesn’t mean that it EVER made any sense at all.

Possibly but only if he had countless tries Watch the film Star Trek from 2009 In both the prime and the Kelvin timeline James Kirk altered the test in Starfleet making it possible for him to rescue the ship In Star Trek Video Game Starfleet Academy( not Canon) they mention some possibilities (on how to cheat) Normally the test is designed to be unwinnable.. it's in test of character. It's a test of what would you do during a no win situation. However even an unwinnable test is not 100% foolproof. The person who programmed the test of the simulation usually tries to think of nearly everything but unfortunately they can't all the time. There might be a way to beat it but it's very rare and it may take many tries to do that. Normally they don't let you keep trying. But Kirk got three chances in the Kelvin timeline Is the Kobayashi Maru test winnable even if you don't cheat? Apparently it is! Watch the first season of Star Trek Prodigy.(Highly Recommend Prodigy BTW. despite being a kids show it has many adult themes.and its very entertaining and in line with Trek canon. wayyyy better than the crapfest Discovery Probably the best Trek series since DS9) in the 1x6 episode, The main character Dal takes the test over and over and actually finds a way to beat it ( and would have won if he wasn't so careless and not put his feet on the console causing a torpedo to destroy his original ship) And this is considered Canon in Star Trek that means that whoever programmed it did did not think of everything.. but that's just lazy programming. if someone really wanted to do their due diligence and think of nearly everything making it almost impossible for the average person to come up with a solution it would take them a long time to program it . So to answer your question, yes If Data had the same amount of tries he probably would have also won. But we have no idea how many times Dal tried. And I don't think that Starfleet would have let a person take it 200 times just to find a weakness in the programming. Here is a video from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ,where we are introduced to the test. The Original Kobayashi Maru test was vs Klingons The upgraded version was against Romulans( as at the time the Klingons were/are allies and had a treaty and there was NO more Klingon Neutral Zone following the Khitomer Accords Heres how it works, The crew during the simulation recieve a distress call from the ship Kobayashi Maru. it is in the neutral zone entering it would violate the Treaty with the Klingons.. therein lies the conundrum. Typically during the first or 2nd try there is only so many ways to solve this: Do you ignore it? honoring the treaty? even if it means the death of innocents?Do you attempt a rescue? If either side enters and is detected, this constitutes an act of war. IF you try, several Klingon ships( or Romulans in the newer version) decloak & attack you. In comparison to the firepower of your ship, you are hopelessly outmanned and outgunned .Even if you are able to destroy 1, or 2 …or ALL ships by some miracle. several more enemy vessels quickly show up . Now you are once again outnumbered, but now your ship is severely damagedDo you try to escape if you see yourself outnumbered and dont want to appear like Starfleet just violated the treaty?No good, as you may find yourself without warp drive, OR they may catch up to you and kill you WHILE you are escaping at warp So as you can see, you have little options at first. Dal won only because he had countless tries and found a flaw in whoever programmed the test. But it might have been luck more than anything. The person who programmed the Kobayashi Maru test is an imperfect being. Since the being is not perfect,that means there's always a possibility that would only mean that the programming was flawed. But Data and Dal are also imperfect and it would take them many tries to eventually figure it out. But I think the point is you're not supposed to keep trying. As I said it is a test of character because when you're around in space you might come across a situation that you just cannot win. So what do you do? Do you destroy yourself to prevent an enemy from capturing your ship? Do you go down fighting? Do you try to escape? Do you not bother risking your ship???? That's what the test is about. Its a psychological test Think of it as like a Rorschach test. It's supposed to have Starfleet know what kind of person you are. Are you aggressive? Are you careful? Are you cunning? Are you too by the book? That would go in your Starfleet file and that's why the test is so important.. Any future commander would read this for any of your future postings. Watch the TNG episode Tapestry to understand why the Kobayashi Maru test is used Originally ,Picard was bold because he had a near death experience. but in an alternate timeline he had no such experience so he lived life very cautious and never rose to command duties, He was at most a worker bee. if i had to guess, this version of Picard probably didnt risk his ship in the Starfleet test. Thats not to say that everyone in command is reckless. Just sometimes take risks and stand out. be a leader. Kirk did not believe in a no win scenario and while there are always options ( as Worf once said) that doesn't necessarily mean that those options can end up having you victorious in the end. Kirk was just lucky in his entire career that he never ran into a truly unwinnable situation. But there is always no win scenarios.. For example, in Star Trek Into Darkness Kirk would have been killed if it wasn't for Scotty sabotaging the Vengeance. That was a no win scenario The enemy ship had more powerful weapons, it was faster and just more advanced in every way. You couldn't run or hide from it. And it was clearly far more rugged as it was able to survive Photon torpedo explosions inside and still remain intact. They all should have been killed. The only reason why they didn't is because of plot armor.. sheer Luck. UPDATE However. the only reason why Dal beat the test was . according to the ep, beamed on board the Klingon ship and then disabled or killed the crew. But the BOP would have shields up so this is a major plot hole as it would prevent Dal from transporting to their ship during battle So this may be Lazy writing in Prodigy to prove you can beat the Kobayashi Maru Test after all!. But as long as there are flaws in it including the one I mentioned ,"},{"prompt":"What one thing being Dutch do you find most embarrassing about your country?","completion":"The way we always think we are better than the rest..

To recollect, its predecessor featured the Snapdragon 765G chipset. The Dimensity 1200 chipset SoC drives the Nord 2 5G along with a 4,500mAh battery. For selfies, it may feature a 32-megapixel front camera, and its rear camera array may comprise of a Sony IMX766 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 2-megapixel camera. OnePlus partnered with MediaTek to take this same design and amp up its AI features, integrating optimizations for display quality and image processing. The result is the Dimensity 1200-AI chipset that will debut in the OnePlus Nord 2. Specifically, the Nord 2-Dimensity 1200-AI pairing enables features like AI Resolution Boost and AI Color Boost for a better display experience, AI photo and video enhancement features, a more powerful night mode called Nightscape Ultra, better image stabilization, faster image processing for lag-free shooting, and more. Hardware acceleration for software features like these usually result in better efficiency and battery life when performing these tasks, but we don’t yet have any data from OnePlus or MediaTek on this front.

I also agree it would have to depend on your weight gain pattern. In my case, I grew up obese. I had never been thin so I had no point of comparison. I weighed 150 lbs when I was 9 years old. At the time, no one else in my family was fat. I have to say something controversial -keep in mind I do not imply this applies to all obese people just some of them. As an obese person, you can be obsessed with your weight to a narcissistic extent. When you walk into a room, your first thought is \\"everyone thinks I'm fat, they're looking at how fat I am\\". That is your relationship to the world. You think you're not popular, loveable, successful or whatever because you are fat. I'd never really tried to go on a diet. With my self esteem in the toilet, I thought it was a wasted exercise, I could never be successful at it and I had no future. At the time I was a high school drop out who shoveled sewers in a food factory. I lived with my cat in a tiny travel trailer. By my 18th birthday (June) I was suicidal and thought I would kill myself as a new year's resolution. In August, it struck me I could just try a diet and maybe save myself. I did everything you're supposed to do, really. I never cheated once. At the end of six months I weighed myself. I'd only lost 20 lbs. You might think it depressed me but I was PISSED, outraged! All that sacrifice for a crappy 20 lbs?! So, I sold my car and bought a bike. The weight came off faster then. I ended up losing 150 lbs over three years. It changed my whole life. [The only advice I can give to anyone trying to lose weight is to know it was harder and took much longer to lose the last 30 lbs than it was to lose the first 120. I think I would have gained weight back if I hadn't lost the last 30 which reset my body metabolism.] After the weight loss, I went to visit my parents who picked me up at the airport. They didn't recognize me even when I stood in front of them and spoke to them, they heard my voice but looked right past or around me, looking for me. It didn't make me feel good, I started crying right there in the airport. Didn't they love *me*? Wouldn't they know me anywhere, anyhow? But they did not. Anyway, I suddenly had a future -and shockingly enough, a lingerie model figure (36-24-36). Hell, if I'd known I was going to look like that, I would have tried dieting while I was still in junior high! It was bizarre, I could do and be anything -maybe. I signed up for classes at the community college even though I was so afraid I was too stupid to handle the course load. I admit fear ran me (weight can do that to your head) but I made the dean's list every semester. I later transferred to an excellent school and took more rigorous coursework, ending up with three majors. Most semesters I took over 21 credit hours with a near perfect 4.0 (I've had one B in my college career). But back to the narcissism thing, weight plays head games with you. Once I was thin and the shoe was on the other foot, I *knew* that weight wasn't the first thing I noticed about someone but I would feel sorry for some fat people because I knew that was what they thought and there was no telling them any different. It was only when I was thin that I could see fat people could be happy, loved, successful - and wonderful in spite of their weight. I had to face the fact that people didn't like me because I was an a - a whole other story. Cleaning up my head with therapy sessions took YEARS. I do want to say another thing. Notice I have never said \\"if I could do it, you could do it\\" because it's not true. Saying that deprecates everyone's experience, that what I did is so trivial that anyone could do it if they only had a little perseverance and discipline, that being overweight is a character issue. That is crap. Obese people know all about perseverance, otherwise they'd never get out of bed in the morning. Post script: I'm still obsessed with weight albeit not my own. I'm an internationally recognized authority in clothing sizes."},{"prompt":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","completion":"Here is a really simple one and how it played out for me.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","completion":"It really depends on the level of literacy of the person but also which part of the text you give them. For example: “Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον”. That’s the first verse of the Odyssey. “Talk to me Muse about the cunning man”. Let’s break it down to the modern Greek translation. Άνδρα = (για τον) άνδρα. Έννεπε = πες μοι = μου Μούσα = Μούσα πολύτροπον = (τον) πολυμήχανο. It’s practically the same. Even if you left πολύτροπον as it is and not use the commonly used πολυμήχανο instead, people would get the gist. Most Greeks would be able to tell easily what this phrase means. Does that mean Homer is easy? Hell no. I can’t understand most of Homer, even though I studied both the Iliad and the Odyssey before in the original in high school. It’s too hard. The grammar is hard, the syntax is hard, many words are unknown to me in their archaic form. I can understand maybe 15% or 20% of it and that’s by putting in quite some effort. It’s not unintelligible either though. If I had to compare it with something in English, it wouldn’t be Beowulf level of difficulty, but it wouldn’t be Shakespeare level of easy either (that would be Hellenistic Greek). It’s somewhere in between. Homer is the earliest form of Greek literature we have. Before that we only have inscriptions in Linear B, before the invention of the alphabet. I can’t read Linear B, so that’s how far back you have to go for Ancient Greek to be completely unintelligible to me."},{"prompt":"Which is the best theme restaurant in Bangalore?","completion":"Android Download Link: [LINKED_TEXT: Udeels - Nearby deals & offers - Android Apps on Google Play] [URL: http://udeels.com/dw?a=1623dc88] iOS Download Link: [LINKED_TEXT: Udeels | Find Nearby Deals & Offers on the App Store] [URL: http://udeels.com/dw?i=1623dc88]"},{"prompt":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","completion":"First off - Vedic Rudra is the directly related to the present \\"Puranic\\" Shiva. Vedic Vishnu is directly related to the present Vishnu. The Goddesses Saraswati, Ushas, Ratri and Vac are directly related to the present Devi. But to the larger point - Our Dharma evolves. Indra is constantly praised in the Rg Veda, but he is barely worshipped at all anymore. The same goes with many of the Vedic deities - Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Ushas, Vayu, Yama... I could go on. One way to look at things is that our ancient ancestors worshipped elemental forces - rain, wind, sun and river - because that is what they needed to survive at that level of civilization. As our human civilization evolves, so did our dharma, and deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi slowly co-opted and replaced earlier devotions. In my opinion this is a greatness of our dharma compared to the Abrahamic faiths. We have many books, many gods, many ways of looking at the world, and they adapt and evolve throughout time without loosing their essential core. The Abrahamic faiths have one book, one prophet, one \\"God\\" and are unable to change and adapt as humanity evolves."},{"prompt":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?","completion":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast? Leverage. There are only so many hours in a day and only so many dollars in your pocket. If you try to succeed with just brute force, you’ll be limited by both of those. If you work 20 hours and sleep 4 and use all ten dollars in your pocket, that won’t get you very far and you’ll be exhausted. If however you can sign on your spouse and nine friends to support your dream and join you on a quest, a mission, a start-up, you’ve got the manpower. And if they can all dig into their savings or take out loans, you’ve got ten times the working capital. Thus you can get where you’re going ten times faster. There are many sayings, such as “behind every great man is a great woman,” and there’s truth to that as he has a 2:1 ratio of abilities with a behind the scenes partner facilitating everything he does.

George just couldn’t go back to sleep after the annoying sex he had moments ago with his wife, Mitchell. He instead went to the living room, made a drink for himself and switched on the TV. Any husband would be upset to learn that his wife is in love with someone else. He was suspicious of her acts but never in his wildest of dreams he had thought that situation could be this much worse. His annoyance crossed the threshold when he saw the man responsible for everything on one of the channels. He switched multiple channels but still couldn’t escape Adam Smith’s flawless face and charming smile, that’s exactly how his wife would describe him. It was his birthday and the same being featured on every channel. George made another drink for himself. The bastard had kissed Mitchell more often than her own husband. She would even strip off her clothes to feast his eyes with her curves in George’s absence. Although George had known all this he would stay quiet for he wanted his wife herself to confess everything about her lover, but that never happened. “Adam turns forty tonight”, she had said which immediately pissed off her husband. He felt as if Smith’s birthday pleased his wife even more than sex and thus had walked out of the bedroom. Adam Smith’s smile appeared to mock George from within the TV. He had lost his head as he grabbed the knife from the fruit basket placed on the dining table. Had Adam been there in front of him, George would have slaughtered him on his birthday. But since it was his wife who seemed more excited about everything, she deserved the lesson to be taught first. After all she had chosen her lover over her husband. He got up from his chair and walked towards his bedroom. His wife lay naked in the blanket on the bed. He sneaked towards her side of the bed with the knife in his hand. There was just enough light for him to see her face. He wondered whether he should do it and thought hard to find any reason which would prevent the same. He couldn’t find one. He then cautiously started to scratch the knife on the wall beside her wife. Its sound, however, woke up Mitchell. “Honey, what are you doing?” she said as she switched on the lamp. “Saving our marriage” he said. “And how would peeling Adam Smith’s picture off the wall save our marriage?” “At least you would be spared from sharing your lips with this bloody picture” “George, are you jealous of this picture?” Mitchell smiled. “I am just jealous of the bastard who has turned my wife into a fanatic, else why would she utter his name while having sex with her husband” he said. “Honey, I must have mentioned it casually.” “Then it certainly wasn’t the right time for you to be casual” he said. “Why don’t we just forget everything and start from where we had left” she said as she took hold of his hand. “What do you mean?” “You know what I mean George, don’t you?” she kicked off the blanket with her feet to flaunt her curves, this time however for her husband. George threw away the knife and jumped into the bed as Mitchell’s lover survived on the wall yet again for another day."},{"prompt":"What's it like being a Slider, a person whose energy effects electronic equipment by making it shut down, malfunction or go haywire?","completion":"I've never heard of a slider until today, but the things that happen are frustrating, amusing, scary, entertaining, unbelievable, fun, amusing, intimidating, isolating, interesting, intriguing, draws unwanted attention.

You'll definitely want to have a fundraising campaign for the gym which includes a lot of careful, behind-the-scenes work leading to one-on-one meetings between some combination of your school head, trustees, development director and your major donor prospects wherein the donor is asked for a significant gift. Standard wisdom is that 80-90% of the funds will come from 10-20% of the donors. It is also pretty standard that a project this large has arisen out of a thoughtful strategic planning process. This is not bake sale territory but you do want the campaign to become accessible to everyone once it is known to be a success. When you have commitments for the bulk of the needed funds you can open up the campaign to the community to encourage everyone's involvement, and do something like sell square feet of the gym for 10 each. Those parts of the campaign are really fun and can engage lots of volunteers and raise the profile of your school's fundraising program. Best of luck."},{"prompt":"What’s your favorite name for any machine learning algorithm?","completion":"I think I’d like to answer with this super funny meme!"},{"prompt":"As a doctor, what is the most stunning lack of understanding of their own body you've seen a patient have?","completion":"Not a Doctor but this story is, to me, so sad. Firstly I am adopted. My Mom never told me about sex or menstruation but had the decency to ask a trusted teacher to do it. This was before sex ed in schools. The reason she did that was as she told me here and I will repeat it. My mother was born in 1926 and has passed away so I think she won’t mind. I started asking her about the changes going on with my body. Some girls in my class already were wearing bras and some had started their periods. My mother told me she couldn’t talk to me about it. She said it was because she started when she was 16. She had no idea what was happening and thought she was dying of cancer or a blood disorder or something. When she tried to talk to my grandmother, my grandmother tossed a bra at her and told her to start wearing it so that she didn’t look like a loose woman. My grandmother also told her only bad women had sex and that she didn’t want to hear anything about this again and that my mother was to never shame her family by talking about this anymore. My poor mother finally moved off the farm when she was 19 to work in the big City. She secretly went to a Doctor to ask about her monthly bleeding. He actually laughed at her and called her stupid before explaining to her what was going on. This would have been around 1944. So sad really. She spent 3 years of her life thinking she was dying. How awful that must have been. Again, she felt she couldn’t talk to me about it so she had the smarts to have someone do it for her and the teacher handled it very well. On a side note, since my mother had never been pregnant in her life, she was totally unprepared for my pregnancies. Oh how she worried about very insignificant things. She was also superstitious so thought if I saw a bat the baby would have a birthmark, or if I didn’t sleep in the afternoon daily I would miscarry. I spent a lot of time reassuring her I was fine but that was hard too. Ignorance is not bliss. I get this was a different generation and time period but wow, still blows my mind since it really seems quite cruel. I often wonder if my grandmother even knew why she had 12 children of whom 7 survived. I wonder if she knew where they came from."},{"prompt":"As a stayathome parent, how much help do you get from your partner when running the home and looking after the kids?","completion":"I married a student who went to UCLA medical school. I taught school to earn our living and his tuition while he was there. His last year we had a baby. He then became an intern and resident, before he began practicing medicine as a pediatrician. I knew what I signed up for. I missed him terribly when he was gone… and he was gone every 3rd night for our entire 25 yrs. I did not expect my husband to do any cleaning, laundry, meals, etc. On the other hand, having been home all day with babies, I would hand him a child as he walked through the door. I was grateful. I regret I did so much of the parenting. I handled all the holidays well. I’d invite my entire family to come, so my girls would not notice so much their father was working. He worked once out of 3 major holidays. That includes Halloween when you have young children, July 4th… not only Christmas and Thanksgiving. I became the disciplinarian, as I didn’t think it was fair to wait until my children’s father was home to face issues. I wasn’t actually very good at that. I wish I had done things differently. I never minded organizing the house. It was my job. I loved staying home with my kids. Any obligation I took on, I always made sure I could be reached, if my children needed me. I could not ask a physician to leave his work if one of our girls had an earache. I took on a lot… without a second thought. And have never regretted that decision. I only wish my husband and I had figured out how to raise our children better together. Everyone would have been happier."},{"prompt":"w do new owners of big 35 foot or longer class A motorhomes go from driving an everyday car or pickup truck to driving such a giant vehicle?","completion":"Or a big truck truck driver getting into his own car or van - with practise, and possibly some advice or even instruction."},{"prompt":"What is the best army strategy for TH10 in COC?","completion":"I don’t know guys… What you guys wrote is old or has become nonsense. Even if its not nonsense. It makes no sense to write down the combination, for the best attack is an army adjusted to the base… Watch some videos to learn these army combinations. There you will learn stuff that is reallllyyyyy helpful. Basic tactics, which are useful for even the max townhall levels. FOR TH10: QUEENCHARGES(queen +4/5 healers+ funneling (babe drags+wizards)): Q(ueen)c(harge) lalo (hound + loon +minions) qc hogs(hogrider +wizards) qc/qw miners(miners) qc Dragon(dragons+minions) although I wouldn’t recommend doing queencharges unless queen is maxed and it’s very hard to master. queencharge vs queen walk: queencharge goes deep into the base to take out multiple key defenses. Queen walk breaks max two layers of walls and takes out some valuable stuff, some key defenses and walk along the base Other non queencharge/queenwalk tactics (you can still start your attack with a queenwalk/warden walk as a funnel for your main attack): PEKKABOBAT (4pekka+ some bowlers+ 4healers +wallwrecker min 5 bat spells rest freeze one rage) BAT SLAP (same as pekkabobat but with witches and no pekkas and bowlers) FROZEN WITCH (Army troop combination of bat slap but spells are 1/2 rages 1 heal rest freeze one poision pls) DRAGBAT (Dragons loons bats freeze rage) REMINDER: this is for competitive wars.

Like, to like someone and blush hopelessly hardly happened to me except for 1–2 situations. But then, I did had a crush on someone while I was in 2nd year MBBS. There was this senior of mine who was interning. And while we went into the wards for clinics, no one actually paid heed to us as we had just entered 2nd year. This was somewhere in November. This senior of ours, who was also known as Harrison since he had read the Bible of medicine, HARRISON. Amidst all this, he made sure to teach us something everyday. He used to teach us for for an hour almost daily amidst work. And that too with a strong eye contact. Out of my liking for medicine, I got a crush on him. But as a person, he was very shy and reserved. I don't remember exactly how we bonded (probably, Facebook). Then, after a long time, we exchanged our numbers. We hardly talked. But then, his internship was about to get complete in month of March and we were the organising batch that year. He was from a different state. I knew we would never meet again once he left. So once I had told him that you need to give me a treat before leaving. You're done with this 5.5 years course. This I had told in December. I don't know how he remembered it. We had no contacts over these months. Our postings changed. He went on in some other department as an intern and I was posted somewhere else. But before leaving, he texted me, he asked me that where should we meet as promised. And no matter how much I wanted to meet him, I was surprised and cold. I didn't know how to react. I was like I can't meet him. I'm scared. But ultimately, we met for an ice-cream and spent around an hour together. I was speechless because I was lost. Normally, I talk a lot. And then after having that meeting, he left me near my hostel on his bike. So yeah!! it was a moment with my crush.

Why make a non issue an issue? How will celebrating Eid/ ramdan with army going to improve the secular credentials of the prime minister of India? We need to be more liberal in our thinking. History has been replete with incidents of religious harmony between various faiths in India and fearful riots over small things over small issues. Army is the most secular organisation that India has where you find people of all religions celebrating all the festival's. PM also has to live up to certain expectations/compulsion.. But dividing army on religious lines or showcasing his secularism on a secular forum like army should not be forced or be a point of discussion. 2 If you want to see secularism then just pick up the list of closed government holidays.. You will realise that each religion although not having similar number of followers in the country has equal share in number of holidays on religious days, nearly 4 days each.. for Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian religion other then Buddhism, Janis for central government employees.

Those are C headers, and this is C++.You don’t actually need to include any headers at all in LeetCode. They’re all included for you. They also throw in a using namespace std;, which I’m not entirely thrilled with, but is understandable.LeetCode generally provides you reasonable data structures as inputs, rather than having you parse input files or strings like you might’ve done in class. Here’s an example solution I wrote 5 years ago to a different LeetCode problem, when I was practicing working “interview-like questions.” class Solution { public: vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) { unordered_map< int, int > seen; seen.reserve( nums.size( ) ); int index = 1; for ( const auto num : nums ) { auto it = seen.find( target - num ); if ( it != seen.end( ) ) return { it->second, index }; seen.insert( pair< int, int >( num, index ) ); index++; } return { 0, 0 }; } }; And here’s the framework LeetCode wants you to fill in for findMedianSortedArrays: class Solution { public: double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) { } }; Notice the sorted arrays are provided in vector<int>&, not std::string. There’s no strings in sight, and none are necessary for this problem.

Let me share my personal experience and knowledge on this topic. I've actually been using aloe vera gel on my face for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me! Aloe vera is known for its soothing and hydrating properties, and it can work wonders for the skin. When it comes to leaving aloe vera gel on your face overnight, it really depends on your skin type and how it reacts to the gel. For some people, leaving it on overnight can be absolutely fine and beneficial. Aloe vera can help moisturize your skin, reduce redness, and even promote healing if you have any acne or blemishes. It's like a little overnight spa treatment! However, it's important to mention that everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Some individuals may experience sensitivity or irritation from leaving aloe vera gel on their face for an extended period. So, it's always a good idea to do a patch test first. Apply a small amount of gel on a small area of your face and leave it overnight to see how your skin reacts. Additionally, make sure to use pure aloe vera gel without any added chemicals or fragrances. The more natural, the better! If you're unsure about the product you have, it's always helpful to check the label or consult with a dermatologist. Remember, taking care of your skin is a journey of trial and error. What works for me may not work for you, and vice versa. So, don't hesitate to listen to your skin and adjust your routine accordingly. I hope this information helps you make an informed decision. If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Take care of your skin, and good luck!

They get calories into, they sustain you, if they are heated properly they can warm you a bit. However if you have them in base, or in otherwise hospitable conditions then they are awful. I had the displeasure of experiencing this first hand. I was a trainee Logistics Officer on board a ship going through pre deployment training and assessment. There was a full day of high tempo training planned, it was starting at 0600 so everybody was eating at 0500. The Logistics Officer had the idea that rather than the chefs getting up early and having to cook breakfast, and then clear up, they would feed us ration packs. Hundreds of ration packs, cooked up in vats of boiling water then passed round. They were horrific. Breakfast rations are generally eaten in the dark and cold, sticking a fork into a slightly warmed pouch and scoffing something you can't see, but which is warming you slightly. Instead we were in a brightly lit, warm cosy ship being served sausages and beans that were warmer than the surface of the sun. From what I remember we had an awful day of training. A whole bunch of tired, grumpy and now hungry sailors who couldn't perform. We should have just served bacon baps, and I'm pretty sure that's what we did from then on. You can have MRE in base but I'd avoid it. They are fair more expensive than a good meal and in nearly every example far less enjoyable."},{"prompt":"What is it like to be in a mental hospital for depression?","completion":"At the point when it actually happened, it was a relief. Finally I would be somewhere with specialists taking care of me.At the same time, most of my brain had become numb by then, so the relief seemed minimal and unimportant - it faded in comparison to the buzzing and groaning and ripping going on in my mind. I was sitting in the office, rocking back and forth a little and crying, with my husband filling out the forms and helping me get through it and answer some of the questions. I felt little.I felt crushed.The depression had won. The strong, smart and successful woman had finally run out of ways to put up against a mental disorder. However, I did not feel humiliated or frustrated by the unpleasant stereotype of the term \\"psych ward\\"; I was numbly and distantly curious. After the novelty of the first day had worn off, I just reverted to being numb and stopped being interested in anything around me.What was worse, I began to be additionally irritated by the fact that I had to be present at meal times (I couldn't bear to have people around me and to look at anyone), by the fact that people were watching TV, by the fact that the walls were pale green, by the narrow windows, by the uncomfortable chairs, by the questions, by everything. Still, there was that voice in the back of my head that it would still, eventually, be better for me than sitting at home hating the walls. And, eventually, it was."},{"prompt":"As an Operating Room nurse, what was the closest call for the patient you’ve witnessed?","completion":"I worked in PACU for several years (post anesthesia care unit = Recovery Room). On Tuesdays we had “tonsillectomy’s” and all kinds of ENT surgeries. Being a former ED (Emergency Department) nurse I kept my certifications in ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and PALS (Pediatric Advanced life Support). The weekend before I had just completed my PALS so it was all fresh in my brain. We had about 10 cases that day and we knew we would be busy with children. All the PACU nurses get a certain number of patients as they come out of the OR. This one little, 5 year-old boy with a beautiful smile and head of blonde hair. I too had a 5 year-old blonde boy at home, so I was especially drawn to him. He wasn’t my patient and his case was the last one of the day. I noticed his Nurse continued to give him tissues as he was spitting out a lot of blood post operatively. I watched as I tended to my own patients and asked her if she thought the amount of blood was “normal.” About 30 mins later he threw up A LOT. It was all blood and she called me over , we quickly cleaned him comforted him and called his MD, but we couldn’t reach him. The anesthesiologist was still there and came to the bedside. The Nurse gave her report and the Dr seemed fine with the details. I quickly grabbed the Doctor and said “This kid is going into shock—you need to get the MD stat!” The MD told me I was over dramatic. “He’s fine.” We hung more IV fluids and followed the orders. I suggested calling the MD again as I wasn’t completely comfortable with what I was seeing. The doctor was at another hospital doing rounds and said he'd come ASAP. I returned to check on my patient, who was ready to be discharged. While I was outside with my patient, putting them in the car, this kid again throws up all this blood. His nurse is calling for me immediately to help her, and he’s now white as a sheet. I remember his vitals were falling and I was starting to PANIC ! The anesthesiologist comes back for the last round and now sees what I'd tried to explain, calls the MD who is enroute, he tells us to get the OR ready, and that the child has an active bleeder. We had to airlift this child to a “Children’s Hospital.” The helicopter landed in our driveway. I never cried so hard as a nurse as that night. I was praying that perfect little boy would make it. Apparently he had a family history of a “clotting” disorder that was unknown since he never had surgery before, but he MADE it!"},{"prompt":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","completion":"No. I wake up everyday in disbelief that Lying Don Trump is president."},{"prompt":"w can I buy IKEA or IKEAlike furniture in India?","completion":"Their Restaurant & Cafe is great!!1 for a hotdog..it cant get better than that.

A rigorous study can confidentially state correlations and suggest causation but rarely with the confidence a well designed experiment can. In theory social sciences could engage in experiments and have similar levels of confidence of conclusion but societal ethics don't allow us to conduct experiments on people and groups, fortunately.

Is that a good/bad thing? Hmm, may be it is a bit a both but that is another discussion altogether. Let me try to list out the reasons why we Kannadigas are least well known: Karnataka state itself is multi-lingual with significant Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, Telgu, Tamil speaking populations. Being a multi-lingual state, Kannadiga population as a percentage of state population is significantly less compared to the percentage of Tamil, Telgu, Malayali population in their respective statesKannada film industry is not as successful which is a very big reason. Again one of the reasons could be smaller market due to less Kannadiga populationThe fragmented nature of Karnataka's linguistic demography has worked against the rise of a regional political party thus denying Kannadigas the political clout enjoyed by other South Indians.Kannadigas are generally humble and do not have a tendency to blow their own trumpet. In contemporary India where the more loud and bombastic communities get widespread coverage, this becomes a liability. That said, its not a popularity contest and at the end of the day, we are all Indians. With almost all large Indian cities already being cosmopolitan and becoming more so, the day is not too far when such linguistic distinctions gradually fade away due to inter-community marriages among the different linguistic groups."},{"prompt":"Will the megacomet heading towards Earth hit Earth?","completion":"C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) has been found to measure over 80 miles in diameter. For comparison’s sake, the asteroid that is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs was only around six miles wide. This one is hurting toward Earth at around 22,000 mph...of course \\"hurting toward Earth\\" is a relative term, because unless you're an amateur astronomer with a very serious set up, living in the southern hemisphere, you're incredibly unlikely to ever even get a glimpse of it, let alone see it strike the Earth! If a comet this size were to actually be headed straight for us, you'd still have very little to worry about from the comet itself, the biggest threats you'd need to worry about would likely come from fellow humans in the weeks before it hit. The comet strike itself would be of little concern as it would very likely wipe us off the surface of the planet in short order! While one day this might actually be a concern, it most certainly is not, in this case."},{"prompt":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","completion":"Human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last century. The majority of the gases are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels to generate energy. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the earth, trapping energy and warming the atmosphere. We should initiate a [LINKED_TEXT: climate change awareness campaign] [URL: https://bpac.in/climate-change-winning-the-race-against-time/] across the world to take a step forward for a better earth. Over the last century, global warming has had a significant impact on the world. It refers to the unusually rapid rise in the earth's average surface temperature over the last century, which is primarily caused by greenhouse gases emitted when people burn fossil fuels. Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions and accumulation in the earth's environment. Bright surfaces like clouds and ice reflect nearly 30% of incoming sunlight into space. The remaining 70% is absorbed by the land and ocean, followed by the atmosphere. Scientists have predicted that when global warming occurs, the following effects will occur: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea-level rise, and more intense heat waves. Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, owing primarily to greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. To conclude, we must work towards combating global warming and other effects of climate change. If the earth's temperatures continue to rise in the future, living things on the planet will soon become extinct as a result of extreme heat. If humans helped in controlling global warming, the world would be cooler and the current high temperatures would be reduced. This world would be more secure to live in if everyone stood together and attempted to stop the majority of the environmental changes that are happening."},{"prompt":"w do I see who liked something on Twitter?","completion":"Very simple 1.open your account 2.click on your profile 3.

Have you traveled through time to 3000 years ago and observed them !? Thirdly who cares if someone's skin has lesser or more melanin in it?! Being white or dark is not an achievement nor it is a point to be proud of, it is a gnenetical thing, if a white Nordic man comes and lives in middle eastern climate for 4 generation his offspring can be darker than he was. So who cares?! Original Persians migrated from Sibera looking for warm waters and places to farm, they resettled in the Iranian plathue, nobody knows if they were white or brown or black, as far as we can say they were smart to dig canals and farm and create an empire, later on they might have been mixed with other tribes or races but when you look at it, we humans are all originated from sahara desert, we chose to migrate and spread in different continents but the climate decide the amount melanin in our skin, it doesn't make us smarter or dumber, what makes us dumber than others is the amount of prejudice, bias and racism we hold toward others for the color of their skin."},{"prompt":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","completion":"It reacts to potassium superoxide in special cans and releases O2"},{"prompt":"What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)? Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","completion":"Within the military ceremonial is very important, the red suit and black hat as you call it is full dress or Number 1 dress. In the British military, not only the army, tradition also plays an enormous part in the ethos and behaviour of people. A soldiers job is to project force on behalf of his government and the Guards regiments do that extremely well. But it does give a certain felling of pride and well being to march through town with bands playing whilst wearing your best suit. If ceremonial was scrapped then an army becomes nothing more than a rabble. I heard a story some years ago about a group of Paras who were fighting insurgents in a certain African ex colony, In the midst of a fire fight the Company Sergeant Major was so incensed at the behaviour of the enemy that he strode out into the open and gave them a verbal beasting as only a CSM can. He called them out of hiding and held a parade there and then in the jungle and in the vernacular “ripped them a new arsehole” for their fire discipline and standard of dress. That is what ceremonial is all about, pride. Dont be fooled by the full dress, the bayonets are sharp, the rifles are loaded and the guys are on guard are proud to be protecting Her Majesty and her family. Take the piss all you like, but be prepared to take the consequences as well."},{"prompt":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52.

A normal blood pressure reading is typically less than 120/80 mmHg. A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute is generally considered to be within the normal range for adults, although it can vary depending on age, fitness level, and other factors. It's important to note that blood pressure and heart rate can fluctuate throughout the day, and a single reading may not provide an accurate representation of your overall health. It's recommended to take multiple readings over time to determine your average blood pressure and to speak with a healthcare provider to determine if further evaluation or treatment is needed."},{"prompt":"What is the cutest incident you had with your crush?","completion":"I was lucky to be REALLY good friends with my crush.

Many will not know of them, but we of a certain age will recall some great songs, “Baby Blue,” “Come and Get It,” “Day After Day,” and that they were on the radio constantly in the early 70s. Well, apparently, even when the band was touring heavily and getting tons of airplay, their management was ripping them off to the point where most of the band members were broke. One of their founding members committed suicide, and several years later, after more financial struggle, another member killed himself as well. Two talented young musicians lost to the despair of having been used. When “Baby Blue” was used in that episode of “Breaking Bad” (don’t wanna spoil anything by being too specific), I just about fell off my chair, shivers running up my spine. Love that song. The Beatles loved them too and signed Badfinger as the first act on their new Apple label. It was an auspicious start, but was short-lived because of the attraction of profit.

She asked me one question which i was not prepared for. “Why didn’t you appeal for your rejections?” I replied “If someone has judged me in 5 seconds it is hard to impress them back again no matter how genuine you are” That was it. Two days later my passport came back. It had the Visa. Mission accomplished. Christmas in Paris is gonna be amazing i guess.

You need to specify the name of the database, your ID/username and your password for database access.Install the application for SMS gateway on the systems that you will use for creating and sending SMS messages.

They give you time to hang up your clothes, do a little sight-seeing, enjoy a few home-cooked dinners. They take you out for scrambled eggs and pancakes in the morning and wave you goodbye from the platform. Short stories, though, can be inhospitable. With their clipped length, they kick you out just when you’re getting used to your cousin’s lumpy futon. But (to belabor this metaphor), sometimes short trips are the best ones — the most memorable. Short stories are like a day trip to Paris. Exhausting, sure. But you still get to see the Eiffel Tower and eat a croissant. (Metaphor... finally... over.) If you don’t read short stories, you could be missing out; some of our greatest writers do their best work with the short story form. Alice Munro, Ann Beattie, and Lorrie Moore all fall into this category. And some short stories made big splashes when they first came out in Vogue or The New Yorker, shocking readers or drawing their attention to an important issue. Years later, they’re still talked about in English classes and book clubs."},{"prompt":"Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?","completion":"Qualitative assessments are ALWAYS moving qualitatively. Ever self-critical, ever improving- and hopefully relevant (and not expensively superfluous) towards some end point that theoretically insures purity, potency, which involves consistency and cross-checking via people, premises, processes, products and procedures. EVERYONE involved is a ‘researcher’ to be vigilant towards reasonable improvement through appropriate validation. Well practiced researchers must insure ‘appropriate’ validation procedures as well, referenced to ‘Standard(s)’ as a rule… which is pretty much the ‘cornerstone’ of Scientific Method. In Clinical and Pharmaceutical work, anything performed on the premises that doesn’t have a documented SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), is not to be done. Is it possible for SOP’s to become ‘overkill,… the adoption of procedures that COULD NOT have a direct or indirect impact on ‘quality, or purity or potency? YES - certainly… but there’s no SOP for reviewing THAT… thus such issues officially do not exist."},{"prompt":"What is the scope of forensic science in India?","completion":"The word forensic comes from the Latin term forensis, meaning \\"of or before the forum. In modern day it can be termed as “pertaining to court of law.” Forensic science is a science applied to criminals to collect evidence and produce them before court of law. During any crime science certain evidences remain un-noticed even by the experts. In those situation the criminals are found be innocent in the absence of adequate proofs and hence they are set free. Forensic science is really a science that helps to collect certain diminutive evidences for instance blood, semen, sweat and pubic hairs, body hairs or finger prints on door or wooden cart etc. Forensic investigators apply certain tools and techniques to find those finer details to present before court and re-create the whole crime scene. It is indeed a very interesting career and has a lot of explorations. The scope of forensic science study is vast. You can get jobs in various governments & private sectors. The study will improve your skills and knowledge. You also may employ in Forensic Laboratories, Detective Offices, Banks and other Govt. and private agencies. Top 5 Highest Paying Forensic Science Careers Forensic Medical Examiner.

I was horrible. We would do these graphic design projects in a traditional looking classroom with a bunch of computers. I’d sit there with my digital pen, plugging away, working on my picture. We had one memorable assignment where we were tasked with digitalizing our favorite actor. I chose Tom Hanks and started using my pen to draw him on my computer during class. I’d spy on other art students working on their picture and I knew I was toast. If it were a math class, I’d totally have been cheating off of them. But this was art. Not so simple. The fun part was, “Peer Critique”. Each student, prints and puts his piece of art up on the board, then walks back and sits down. And the entire class critiques the art. All these artsy kids around me were producing super hot versions of actors and actresses. Then dumbass Sean, who shoulda never been in art class, walks up, pins his on the board: This is my Tom Hanks (who looks like an amoeba). Sucking at art was a blessing. But the classes were still really fun. Who doesn’t want to draw pictures? Later, I worked at an ad agency (in a writing role - which I was better suited for.) In writing ads, particularly print ads, you work with designers quite a lot. And you see up close just how miserable they usually are. Life for graphic design majors, or any type of art major isn’t a pretty one. Which is the ultimate buzz kill because the major is so fun. You take an immediate nose dive after graduation.

They are very active during sandhya (conjunctions of day and night) as well as during midday and midnight. According to Garuda Purana 2.49.11, they can enter (so-called possession) non-living objects, insects, birds, animals, people, and devas. In some cases within days after death, they temporarily possess a wild animal, a bird, or an insect (e.g. a butterfly). In this form, they appear to their family members to say goodbye. This however doesn't mean they have peacefully left, rather the opposite.Often they attach themselves to the subtle body of an incarnated being and live off his energy like parasites. They feed on impure substances (all kinds of garbage). They suffer because without a physical body they can't fully satisfy their desires like hunger, thirst, or sexual desire. This pertains especially to persons addicted to intoxicants who need a host with whom thus appears or increases an existing addiction. They wait until their karma-set time expires to be able to incarnate again."},{"prompt":"w much money can you make online?","completion":"I can provide you with information on how much bloggers earn.

There are different ways to monetize a blog, such as display advertising, affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, selling digital or physical products, and offering services. The income potential varies widely depending on the strategy used and the blogger's level of expertise in implementing it.

In this case anyone can read the message they just can’t change it without anyone knowing. the second is the actual encryption, that stops anyone reading the contents of the message. then there’s identification, you know that in order for the certificate to say it’s from company x, the certificate authority had to verify it genuinely was that company requesting it. This falls down if the certificate authority is not trustworthy though. basically the implementation of it is irrelevant, you need to know the keys to decrypt it.

Totipotent stem cells have unlimited developmental plasticity; unipotent stem cells are the most limited. A totipotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #GHVhW] is capable of developing into any cell of the human body or any of the extraembryonic structures (placenta, umbilical cord, allantois, or amnion). The initial zygote is a totipotent stem cell, as are those formed by the its early divisions (cleavage). At the morula stage shown here, all of the cells are totipotent. This holds only for the first few days after fertilization.Morula, composed of totipotent stem cells.[LINKED_TEXT: morula | Description & Facts] [URL: https://www.britannica.com/science/morula] A pluripotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #GSpDd] is one that can develop into any cell of the embryonic body, but not into any of the extraembryonic structures. Its developmental plasticity is already limited, although not much. The morula develops into a hollow-ball stage called a blastocyst. This is composed of an outer cell mass (trophoblast) that becomes all the extraembryonic structures, and an inner cell mass (embryoblast) that becomes the embryo (and eventually the fetus and infant). The cells of each of these masses are pluripotent stem cells; the ones of greatest scientific and medical interest are those of the inner cell mass, since they’re the ones that can produce any cell type of the human body itself. These first two stem cell types (totipotent and pluripotent) exist only in the early pre-embryonic stages of development (first 16 days). The remaining two types exist from embryo to fetus to infant and throughout the rest of life. Blastocyst, composed of two groups of pluripotent stem cells.[LINKED_TEXT: https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Blastocyst_Development] [URL: https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Blastocyst_Development] A multipotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gMzBW] is one that can develop into multiple mature cell types, but not just any type. In the fetus, for example, there are mesenchymal cells that develop into cartilage, bone, blood, connective tissues, and muscle. In the adult, a good example is the hematopoietic stem cell (far left in the figure below) of the red bone marrow, which can develop into red blood cells, any of five kinds of white blood cells, or platelet-producing cells. (Only the white cell lines are shown here.)Leukopoiesis, the development of white blood cells from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell.K.S.

Two good examples are the spermatogonia of the testes, which can only become sperm, and basal stem cells of the epidermis that can only become keratinocytes. In the leukopoiesis chart above, all cells in the green and yellow zones of the top four rows are unipotent stem cells, each of them capable of becoming only a single white cell type. In the bottom group, the lymphocytic CFU and lymphoblast are multipotent stem cells whereas the three prolymphocyte types are unipotent (with allowance for a slightly debatable point I won’t go into).Cross section of a seminiferous tubule of the testis. All of the labeled cells except Sertoli cells are unipotent stem cells.

Much of the research on those has used embryonic stem cells (ESCs)[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #Zznho] derived from the surplus morulas and blastocysts produced at in vitro fertilization (IVF) fertility clinics—preembryos that are ordinarily discarded by a clinic. Even though this makes good medical use of what would otherwise have been destroyed, it still generated a lot of political and ethical controversy. In 2006, Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #fRFRS] succeeded in using transcription factors and growth factors to manipulate adult stem cells (ASCs) into going backward down their developmental pathway (dedifferentiating) to become pluripotent once again. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #FAqQs][LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #YYnAN] and have opened the door to hopes of regenerating many kinds of desired tissue from adult stem cells without the ethical and political issues of ESC technology. Yamanaka has received many prestigious awards for this work including the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #DAOaA] Producing iPSCs is a slow, tedious, costly process with a low success rate, so we still have a way to go in making this efficient and affordable for regenerative medicine. There are also a lot of patient safety issues to be overcome. (For example, could implanted stem cells produce malignant tumors?) You can’t go out next week or next year, maybe not even in the next 10 or 20 years, to get your adult stem cells reprogrammed to replace ailing heart or brain cells; don’t get overanxious and turn your money over to charlatans who claim they can do that for you. Some patients have been blinded and others have developed spinal tumors from slipshod stem-cell “clinics.” iPSCs are already yielding tremendous advances in laboratory stem-cell science, though. Science and medicine thrive on the determination and creativity to get things like stem-cell therapy done. Many labs around the world are working on it.

The main function of DNS is to translate domain names into IP addresses. When a user enters a web address in the browser, the browser will send a request to the DNS server to obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name. Only then can the browser connect to the corresponding server through this IP address and load the page content. If the response time of the DNS server is fast, then the user can get the desired IP address and load the web page faster. Therefore, choosing a fast-responsive DNS server, or using caching technology to increase DNS lookup speed, can speed up Internet access. In addition, there is a technology called \\"smart DNS load balancing\\", which can automatically select the fastest DNS server according to the user's location, network environment and other conditions, thereby further improving the access speed. In short, DNS can help speed up Internet access and provide users with a better surfing experience.

Maintain a nutritious diet: Losing general body fat, including face fat, can be accomplished by eating a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains.Drink enough of water to eliminate toxins from your body and to prevent water retention, which can result in facial puffiness.Regular exercise can aid in weight loss and the reduction of facial fat. Concentrate on calorie-burning aerobic exercises like jogging, cycling, and swimming.Exercise your face: Facial exercises can help you tone your facial muscles and get rid of face fat. Try performing neck rolls, jaw clenches, and cheek raises.Limit your intake of salt and sugar because too much of either can result in water retention and facial puffiness.Get adequate sleep: Sleep is a great way to combat stress, which can lead to weight gain and face fat.Avoid processed foods because they frequently have added sugars, bad fats, and high calorie content that can lead to weight gain and face fat. Instead, emphasize nutrient-dense, entire foods.Gum chewing can help you tone facial muscles and reduce fat on your face. Just be sure to select sugar-free gum to prevent consuming too many extra calories and sugar.Massage your face: Facial massage can assist to enhance lymphatic drainage and blood flow, which helps reduce puffiness and even out skin tone. Use a face massage roller or gently circular strokes with your fingers. Just keep in mind that although working for a healthy weight and body composition is vital, so is loving and accepting yourself at whatever size.

If you have fixed mounts (a fixed angle and direction), there is only one day of the year where for a few seconds the solar panels are at the proper angle and direction for maximum solar conversion (10–17%). If you put a long stick in the ground which is straight up and down (plumb) and watch the shadow on the ground on a sunny day, you will find that the shadow moves very quickly across the ground.

There was another woman, much older than her but a little younger than me who was also receiving shock therapy, she would come up to me and ask me if I had a cigarette for her, and then a short while after repeatedly come and ask me the same question. She couldn't remember she had already asked me repeatedly, and that I had repeatedly said no. There was a young man brought in who I played chess with, he was a brilliant chess player and beat me easily, but he kept saying he had a computer chip in his brain. He believed the computer chip was his source of brilliance. One day he sat down to play with me and had obviously been given some potent medication. He tried to play chess with me but he kept making illegal moves. I liked him better with his computer chip. I saw a woman who never spoke to anyone and nobody else ever spoke to.

Abidal played football professionally for fourteen years, representing his country, France, sixty-seven times and winning nineteen trophies during his career. At his peak, he was one of the world’s best defenders. However, on the 15th of March 2011, at the age of 31, Abidal was diagnosed with a liver tumour. He underwent surgery and at first, it appeared to have been working. He was fit enough to play the Champions League final in May, which his side Barcelona won 3–1 over Manchester United. But that success didn’t last long. Exactly one year after his diagnosis, on the 15th of March 2012, it was announced that Abidal would need a liver transplant. This is Dani Alves. A controversial figure, Alves isn’t a bad footballer himself, having played for seventeen years now (and counting). He’s got a hundred caps for Brazil and thirty-nine senior trophies, making him the most decorated player in football. And yes, you may have noticed from the kit that he also played for Barcelona. Anyway, back to the story (you can probably tell where I’m going with this). Abidal needs a liver transplant at this point, and it doesn’t look great for him. If he doesn’t have a liver, an essential body part, goodness knows how he’s gonna keep playing football. This is looking like the end of his career. But who’s there to step in and save the day? It’s Dani Alves, of course, who offers to donate part of liver. This transplant could end Alves’ career, but if Abidal doesn’t get it, it would end his. You can’t have both. Ultimately, Abidal turned down the offer, instead managing to talk his cousin Gerard into it (would have made for an awkward conversation). In the end, Abidal played on for two more years, moving to play in Monaco and then Greece before retiring. Alves left the biggest team in Spain in 2016 to join the biggest team in Italy, and a year later left them for the biggest team in France. He’s still playing now. Isn’t that incredible? For me, both Abidal and Alves were incredibly selfless in this matter. Alves, after all, would have been sacrificing his career had he undergone the transplant, and Abidal would have done the same had he not. But both of them were willing to put the other over themself. If that’s not selfless, I don’t know what is."},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"Whilst I don’t disagree with the answers below, I find the occasional use of a touch screen on a laptop very useful.

The goal of on-page SEO is to make the content and structure of a webpage more attractive and relevant to both users and search engines, with a particular focus on specific target keywords, such as \\"[LINKED_TEXT: SEO services] [URL: https://zaclab.com/seo-services/].\\" When optimizing a webpage for \\"SEO services,\\" several key elements should be considered: 1. Keyword Placement: The target keyword should be strategically placed in the page's title tag, meta description, and URL to signal its relevance to search engines. 2. High-Quality Content: Creating valuable and informative content related to \\"SEO services\\" is essential. The content should be well-written, engaging, and offer unique insights or solutions to users' search queries. 3. Keyword Density: While it's crucial to include the target keyword in the content, overusing it may lead to keyword stuffing, which can harm SEO rankings. A balanced keyword density is preferred, with natural integration throughout the content 4. Heading Tags: Properly formatted heading tags (H1, H2, etc.) help search engines understand the content's structure and hierarchy, making it easier for them to interpret the page's relevance to the target keyword. 5. Internal Linking: Linking to other relevant pages on the website helps search engines navigate and index the site more effectively. It also encourages users to explore related content, improving user experience and engagement. 6. Image Optimization: Images on the page should be optimized with relevant alt text, helping search engines understand the visual content's context and relevance to \\"SEO services.\\" 7. Page Speed: A fast-loading webpage enhances user experience and positively impacts search rankings. Optimize images, enable browser caching, and minimize server response time to improve page speed. 8. Mobile Responsiveness: With mobile users increasing rapidly, ensuring the webpage is mobile-friendly is crucial for a positive user experience and higher rankings on mobile searches. By diligently implementing these on-page SEO practices for \\"SEO services,\\" website owners can increase the likelihood of their webpages ranking higher on SERPs, driving more organic traffic, and ultimately attracting potential clients seeking SEO services. However, it's important to remember that on-page SEO is just one aspect of a broader SEO strategy, and other factors like off-page SEO, backlinks, and domain authority also play significant roles in achieving SEO success."},{"prompt":"Will Arvind Kejriwal win the Delhi election again by giving freebies to the public?","completion":"Dear Gentle man = the problem is this that you people have not read the Constitution and do not know meaning of Governance .

In this case, n = 10 (since there are 10 terms), a = 1 (since the first term is 1), and l = 10 (since the last term is 10). So we can plug these values into the formula: S = (10/2) x (1 + 10) = 5 x 11 = 55 Therefore, the sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 55."},{"prompt":"Why did India play badly in the semifinal of the T20 World Cup 2022 on 10/11/2022?

To make things worse, for some devices all it takes is to search for that brand on Google and you’ll find the passwords. So who cares if someone hacks your toothbrush? One thing they can do (and that goes with any IoT device), is to create a network they can remotely control.

With over 1 billion users from all over the world, WhatsApp is one of the largest messaging platforms around the world. And since most people use smartphones today, it’s likely most of your contacts are already using WhatsApp. Especially since this app can be used on phones with different operating systems, such as Android devices, Windows, iOS, Symbian, and Blackberry. Using WhatsApp for your teleconference calls also gives your call participants significant flexibility. Participants can take calls while they are on the go, whether they’re at a coworking space, at a coffee shop or waiting in the airport lounge for their next flight. Your callers can get right into the conference by clicking on the link you sent to their WhatsApp. You will have complete control over the conversation, as you can add people, mute others and share files or receive files. You can even schedule conference calls on short notice. Using a reliable service provider for your conference calls also ensures confidential information remains private.

How would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a black/Asian/native person or attend a business lunch with a black/Asian/native person, because morally a white man should not meet 1 on 1 with a black/Asian/native person? Would you tolerate that in an employee? If not, then why would you tolerate an employee telling you that they refused to meet with any other identifiable subgroup of humanity? A person has no control over what gender they were born as than they do what race they were born into. So if it’s wrong to discriminate against a person because of their race then how is it any less wrong to discriminate against them because of their gender? If a person isn’t allowed to meet with certain customers, clients, colleagues or managers just because of their race or gender then that severely restricts how useful they are to the company. That not only hinders their chance of promotion, the so-called ‘glass ceiling’, it also makes it more difficult for them to keep their jobs or even to get hired in the first place. If you don’t think that’s wrong, that it’s unfair, then I submit that the problem isn’t the female (or black, Asian or native) employee. It’s with the person who refuses to work with them or to do business with them (such as selling a cake to them).

VERY roughly, 100F < A < B < C < 145F, but they don’t want to promise / guarantee / suggest that a particular setting on the dial will definitely give you non-scalding water at your fixtures. So set it on the low side - “HOT” or “A” - and use the hot water for a few days. Can you take a comfortable shower? Draw a hot bath? Hand wash dishes comfortably? If so, leave it there, or turn it down half a setting and check again for a few days. Only if you can’t get hot enough water for some task, should you increase it, at most one step at a time. The lower the setting, the safer everyone in the house (and especially children and the elderly) will be from scalds and your water heater will have somewhat lower standby losses (because a 130F tank loses more heat than a 115F tank). The setting below “Hot” (or “Warm on some gas thermostat valves) is a vacation setting and should keep it at a much lower temperature if you’re gone for a long time and want to eliminate standby losses. But you have to reset it upon your return and then wait 30–50 minutes for it to reheat."},{"prompt":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52. Is this borderline high?","completion":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 mmHg indicates that you have borderline high blood pressure. The first number (138) represents systolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats, while the second number (83) represents diastolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. The American Heart Association defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure between 120-129/less than 80 mmHg is considered elevated, blood pressure between 130-139/80-89 mmHg is considered stage 1 hypertension, and [LINKED_TEXT: blood pressure] [URL: https://rb.gy/bgwc] of 140/90 mmHg or higher is considered stage 2 hypertension. A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute is generally considered normal for adults, but this can vary depending on age, fitness level, and other factors. It is important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and speak with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or if your blood pressure consistently falls in the elevated or hypertensive range. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management, may be recommended to help manage borderline high blood pressure. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help lower blood pressure."},{"prompt":"What are the most beautiful gardens in the world?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: People's Gardening Gardening and landscaping , pest and diseases management agri horti cropshttps://peoplegarden.imperialhorticulturetips.com/] [URL: https://peoplegarden.imperialhorticulturetips.com/]"},{"prompt":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","completion":"There actually were big dogs, called borophagines, or “bone-crushing dogs.” Before the Berring Land Bridge opened up, caniforms ruled North America (South America wasn’t connected until long after), and feliforms ruled the Old World. At this time, the borophagines likely filled the same niche as modern panthers in North America as large ambush predators, while early hyaenids likely filled the same niche as modern canines (the only extant subfamily of dogs); modern spotted hyenas are persistence pack hunters. It’s likely that the borophagines are extinct because when the Berring Land Bridge opened up, there was a great exchange of biodiversity between the Old World and North America. This is how proboscideans like mastodons, gomphotheres, and later mammoths got to the Americas. This is also how the ancestors of jaguars and cougars got to the Americas. It’s though that when this happened, big cats outcompeted the borophagines, as they were better at taking down the large prey that borophagines hunted. The canines didn’t have any competition in North America, as the only hyaenid that crossed into North America was chasmaporthetes, or the “running hyena.” It only managed to survive there because rather than being a persistence hunter, it avoided competition by being a sprinter, like cheetahs. There are canines in Africa, some of which do compete on some level with spotted hyenas. Some completely avoid competition altogether with hyenas by filling completely different niches, like foxes and jackals, while African Wild Dogs do come into competition with hyenas. However, they don’t go after large prey as often as hyenas, while there is considerable overlap in their diets. They often fend off hyenas using large packs, and are more efficient hunters in terms of success rate; basically, they avoid being outcompeted by just being as competent as them."},{"prompt":"What is the best LMS for online learning?","completion":"When it comes to LMS, Moodle is preferred by educationists across the globe.

Really! Or what we call Arabic ones. At first, in the Renaissance, this new invention we call a “clock” often/usually had Roman numerals, but for a bunch of reasons Arabic ones often took over. Those numbers, I repeat, are not English. They are Arabic. That was a real revolution—drop Roman numerals and use the ones from the Middle East. No more I, II, . . . V, VI, etc., but 1, 2, 3, etc. And these came to be used by all European and North and South American, etc. in almost all local languages. Our 1, 2, 3 etc. “Arabic” numbers were imported from the Middle East (and before that much happened much Arabic math had made its way from India). To repeat: our numbers are NOT English. Numbers in much/most of the world derive from the ancient Middle East, and with a push from ancient India. Sudden thought—or do you mean the names for the numbers? Not that much from English either. So next time you count, thank the Arabs and their “Arabic numerals” or the Indians of long ago (Indian Indians, not American “Indians”) or the Romans for many of the names for our numerals. By the way, another HUGE invention by the Arabia was Zero, although that invention, too, was started in India."},{"prompt":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","completion":"My country in India.

What weapons do they have?","completion":"“What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)? Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?” This is the citation for the Victoria Cross won posthumously in Afghanistan by James Ashworth. Read it and judge for yourself. “Lance Corporal James Thomas Duane Ashworth, Grenadier Guards, 25228593 (killed in action). On the 13th June 2012 the conspicuous gallantry under fire of Lance Corporal Ashworth, a section second-in-command in 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards Reconnaissance Platoon, galvanised his platoon at a pivotal moment and led to the rout of a determined enemy grouping in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province. The two aircraft inserting the Reconnaissance Platoon on an operation to neutralise a dangerous insurgent sniper team, were hit by enemy fire as they came into land. Unflustered, Ashworth – a young and inexperienced noncommissioned officer – raced 300 metres with his fire-team into the heart of the insurgent dominated village. Whilst two insurgents were killed and two sniper rifles recovered in the initial assault, an Afghan Local Police follow-up attack stalled when a patrolman was shot and killed by a fleeing enemy. Called forward to press-on with the attack, Ashworth insisted on moving to the front of his fire team to lead the pursuit. Approaching the entrance to a compound from which enemy machine gun fire raged, he stepped over the body of the dead patrolman, threw a grenade and surged forward. Breaking into the compound Ashworth quickly drove the insurgent back and into an out-building from where he now launched his tenacious last stand. The village was now being pressed on a number of fronts by insurgents desperate to relieve their prized sniper team. The platoon needed to detain or kill the final sniper, who had been pinned down by the lead fire team, and extract as quickly as possible. Ashworth realised that the stalemate needed to be broken, and broken quickly. He identified a low wall that ran parallel to the front of the outbuilding from which the insurgent was firing. Although only knee high, he judged that it would provide him with just enough cover to get sufficiently close to the insurgent to accurately post his final grenade. As he started to crawl behind the wall and towards the enemy, a fierce fire fight broke out just above his prostrate body. Undaunted by the extraordinary danger – a significant portion of his route was covered from view but not from fire – Ashworth grimly continued his painstaking advance. After three minutes of slow crawling under exceptionally fierce automatic fire he had edged forward fifteen metres and was now within five metres of the insurgent’s position. Desperate to ensure that he succeeded in accurately landing the grenade, he then deliberately crawled out from cover into the full view of the enemy to get a better angle for the throw. By now enemy rounds were tearing up the ground mere centimetres from his body, and yet he did not shrink back. Then, as he was about to throw the grenade he was hit by enemy fire and died at the scene. Ashworth’s conspicuous gallantry galvanised his platoon to complete the clearance of the compound. Despite the ferocity of the insurgent’s resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten. His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.”"},{"prompt":"modern sea warfare, if a destroyer is right above a submarine, is there a chance the submarine will pass undetected?","completion":"There is always a chance. A better question is would it be more likely. I am not an ASW expert but I do understand some of the basic principals. Shipborn Sonars are designed to detect targets farther away preferably before they are in range. The inherent hull and screw noise also creates a “blind spot” close in to the ship. This makes it even harder to find an already difficult target like a submarine."},{"prompt":"it true that the vast majority of Americans truly believe that the USA singlehandedly won the Second World War, and that the British Empire and USSR contributed either nothing or just very little to the Allied victory?","completion":"No. It’s not true.

Hakeem Olajuwan won two titles, with absolutely NO help. He was the only superstar on the Houston Rockets, and they still won titles. He was 12x all star, 12x all NBA, 9x all defensive, 2x defensive player of the year, 2x NBA Finals MVP. If you paired Olajuwan with Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, he would have probably won six titles himself."},{"prompt":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","completion":"I would like to answer this question as it relates in one way to the climate change catastrophe our beautiful planet is facing at the moment. Climate change has no technical solution, it only has a spiritual solution. Veganism is the only permanent solution to the climate change crisis we are facing at the moment.”Meat accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases from food production” per a recent article by The Guardian. Per an article on the UNITED NATIONS website, “Animal-based foods especially red meat, dairy, and farmed shrimp, are generally associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions”.The same article on the United Nations website also mentions the facts below: Meat production often requires extensive grasslands, which is often created by cutting down trees, releasing carbon dioxide stored in forests.Plant-based foods – such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils – generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods. Trust me when I say it’s not impossible to turn Vegan as it calls for a behavior change in how one consumes food. It’s hard to turn Vegan but not impossible. Trust me, you will feel like a million bucks when you become a vegan.I highly recommend watching the Netflix documentary “The Game changers” which shows interviews with various athletes turning Vegan and the transformational positive effects they noticed in their health and performance after turning Vegan. I was a non-vegetarian for 28 years before I turned Vegan. The reason I became Vegan is because I came to know about the harmful effects of meat and dairy industry on our environment. Kindly read the guardian article below. If you want to hear a spiritual perspective on why one should turn Vegan, there is a climate change activist and spiritual leader named Acharya Prashant in India who explains in great detail why a person who cares about this planet and the future generations of humanity should turn Vegan. I highly recommend checking out his videos on YouTube under his channel named “Acharya Prashant”. Kindly check out his interview with Vegan mountaineer Kuntal Joisher who had climbed Mount Everest.Acharya Prashant also talks about how to deal with various life situations (stress, anxiety, relationship issues, depression and other stressful situations) by explaining in simple words the teachings of major scriptures from all religions in the world and how to apply those teachings in the situations a man or woman faces in his or her life.

Gillette invented and started marketing the safety razor in 1895. Before that time, razors were relatively expensive, difficult to obtain, and took a bit of skill to maneuver. Men often had to go to a barber to get a shave. Important people like royals and politicians wore beards because a barber shaving them literally had their life in the barber’s hands. Coup maybe? So using the new razors was not only convenient, but could show the world that a man was modern and up with the times.

Can someone explain it in simple words?","completion":"The analogy I use is with the Duty Manager of a store or restaurant. The concept of a Duty Manager is like a DNS address. It is an abstract concept that can be filled by anybody, anywhere. But you find the Duty Manager in the Duty Managers office. You do a lookup in the directory, a DNS lookup, to find that is, say, floor 2 office 7 - office 2.7. That is an IP address, it tells you where to find the Duty Manager. And when you get to office 2.7, you find a guy called Joe Bloggs, who is the manager on duty at the moment. That is the Mac address, the name of a particular person, a particular piece of hardware. But when Joe goes off duty, somebody else will take on the job. You don’t need to know their name (Mac address), but you do need to know where to find them, office 2.7 (IP address). This is equivalent to changing the network card on the computer. As a remote user, you don’t want to know when someone changes their network card. But you do want to know how to get packets to them. So they will keep the same IP address despite the card being changed. And if the card take out is later plugged in to a new computer, with a totally different function, you don’t want your packets going to it because they went to that card in the old computer. When Joe Blogs gets a different job, you don’t want him getting messages about your problems in the place he no longer works."},{"prompt":"What was your strangest holiday gift that left you shaking your head?","completion":"Sawdust"},{"prompt":"w do authors who create a book series manage to publish books and do their everyday jobs while also having to deal with all the stress?","completion":"Generally, authors of larger series write full-time.

Now, how does one C-Section change the course of world history? Quite a lot believe it or not. Fittingly it all starts with a Princess. The Princess in question is Princess Royal Victoria, eldest daughter of the more famous Queen Victoria (who reigned 1837 to 1901). Now Victoria the younger has been mostly put to the side in history books in favor of her more famous relatives; particularly her eldest child, Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Victoria married Wilhelm’s father, the crown prince of Germany as part of a political alliance back in the day when wealthy people who owned countries sold off their children to secure peace. Now Wilhelm the 2nd is mostly remembered for his militaristic attitude, his imperialistic designs on turning Germany into an empire and for leading his country into World War 1 (while inadvertently sowing the seeds for World War 2 in the process). Now how does this relate to a C-Section? Let me take you back to January 27th, 1859, when the young Princess Victoria was in the process of a difficult and ponderous labor. Unfortunately for the 17 year old monarch, her baby was coming out the wrong way. The not yet born Prince Wilhelm was a Breech Baby, meaning his body was not positioned with his head pointing down. Babies are supposed to be born head first, with their head and shoulders widening the vaginal tract for easier exit of the rest of their body. A breech baby though has a much harder time and this causes a LOT of complications (Imagine trying to shove a triangular block into a square space. Now imagine its alive.) Nowadays when this happens Doctors on site perform a C-Section where the baby is surgically taken out of the womb. Back in this time period C-sections were practiced, but in this case there were two major issues. Princess Victoria was ROYALTY, so the attending Doctors were beyond hesitant to operate on her, especially given that she was the firstborn daughter of arguably the most powerful person on the planet at that time. One mistake could bring down a monarchy’s worth of wrath.There was NO WAY to perform the C-Section without almost certainly killing either the mother, the baby or BOTH. Remember doctors in this time period don’t wash their hands, don’t know what bacteria are, still believe leeches can cure anything and NO ONE WASHES THEIR HANDS. So, faced with this dilemma, the doctors attending chose another option. They gave Princess Victoria as many painkillers as medically possible without killing her, then they yanked out baby Wilhelm one limb at a time, maneuvering him while he was still inside the womb. It was terribly crude by modern standards, but successful. At least until a few weeks after he had been born and Victoria had recovered. Wilhelm had been crippled. Thanks to the manner of his birth, he was afflicted with Erb’s Palsy, which essentially made his left arm a useless stump of destroyed nerves and atrophied muscles. It’s only recently people have discovered how utterly devastating this was for him. Diagram that gives an idea of the subtle but catastrophic damage Wilhelm suffered. You need to understand the time period. Royals took pity on cripples. They themselves could never be cripples. But Wilhelm was. It was an embarrassment to have it. It’s only very recently that we can understand the type of childhood this little prince endured. It honestly pervades into an almost fictional level of tragedy. It plays out in a story pieced together from countless letters saved by descendants of Wilhelm and his family. Letters written by Wilhelm, his mother and his grandmother. First of all, Princess Victoria was deeply ashamed of her son’s deformity. She was guilty that she had birthed an afflicted child. She confessed in communication with her mother \\"He is really smart for his age...if only he didn't had that unfortunate arm, I would be so proud of him.\\" She is also indicated to have heaped greater affection on her children born after Wilhelm.Wilhelm was subjected to several repeated experiments and quack scientific methods to try and cure his arm. Painful electroshock therapy. Sticking his arm inside the corpse of a freshly killed rabbit every day so as to transfer the animals vitality to him (yes they actually tried this). For a time he even had his fully functioning arm strapped behind his back so as to encourage him to use and strengthen his disabled limb. That last method only served to double his disability. They stopped trying to cure it only when he became a teenager. Can you imagine that for a second? Being reminded every single day by family that some small part of you makes you a failure? Something you have no control over? It doesn’t matter what you accomplish or overcome or that your destined to rule one of the most powerful nations on earth. You’re still an embarrassment. Can you imagine the deep seated insecurities and bubbling rage that would fester inside that child’s mind? Quick side note, you can see this everywhere through out Wilhelm’s life. Every well known photograph of him is positioned in a way that hides his significantly smaller hand. He was deeply ashamed of it given that it was a constant reminder of his inferiority and weakness in the eyes of his family. Wilhelm with his father Notice him holding the white glove makes his arm look bigger? It’s strange to see him holding a pair of gloves and still have one covering the other hand. Wilhelm with his first wife Augusta Viktoria. His right hand entirely covering his left. Wilhelm during his final years after being exiled from Germany. So, combine this insecurity into a man raised in a warlike culture (i.e. the entire German state in the 1800s–1900s), suffuse him with a mindset that extolls an outdated version of manliness, add in a healthy dose of unhappy familial relationships and you have a dangerously unstable monarch with designs on proving his worth to the world. Wilhelm, the Kaiser with one good hand wants to show everyone he is strong and in charge. The great irony here, is that Wilhelm had amazing potential to ensure peace in Europe. He was related to Queen Victoria and by extension was a cousin to almost every noble house in Europe. It was essentially one large, strange family running an entire continent who theoretically should have no reason to fight each other since they were all related. An oft forgotten memory from this time is Wilhelm’s great relationship with his grandmother. His relationship with his own mother was cold for his entire life, but if the Kaiser had any redeeming features, it was that he loved his grandmother. Wilhelm with Victoria. No one remembers how when she was laying on her deathbed, Wilhelm was at her side, holding on with his one good hand. Alongside him was his cousin, King George of England. A group of the worlds mightiest leaders, united in grief. It should have been a time for prosperous new beginnings Instead with Victoria’s death, all the familial ties that had bound Europe together suddenly frayed. Without his grandmother, Wilhelm found himself surrounded by rulers he had once seen as family. Now though? They were rivals. People he should challenge to prove his dominance. No different than the people he had hidden away his deformity from. An insecure mind breeds irrational and foolish decisions. Let me tell you another story from this time, passed down through letters between Wilhelm and his mother written in the 1880s. The contents of these letters are Wilhelm reaching out over and over again to his mother. He describes bizarre dreams where he repeatedly kisses her hands and fights for her attention. He’s trying to express his repressed feelings and inadequacies, attempting to build a relationship with a woman who sees him as a disappointment. One of the last lines he writes to her is “Take me as I am.” His mother never responded to the contents of the letters, instead trying to talk with him about politics and matters of state. Other times she wrote back only after correcting his GRAMMAR. Wilhelm never forgave her for this, and after his father died and he became Kaiser, he did everything in his power to marginalize her. As time went on, Wilhelm became more and more focused on militarization and preparing for war with other nations (which has been proven to be one of the decisive factors that caused WW1). There’s anecdotal evidence to suggest that, as her son ventured down this path, Victoria tried desperately to make him seek amnesty with relatives in England and Russia and promote unity among the descendants of Victoria. Wilhelm ignored her. She died just a few months after mother, utterly alone. And a decade later Europe burned. So, recall as I’ve said. I go back and I make sure Princess Victoria has a successful C-Section (Done think too hard on the how). I ensure that Wilhelm II is never crippled at birth, so he is loved by his parents instead of scorned, allowing him to develop a more healthy and less aggressive mindset, where instead of plotting to make war upon his enemies, he reconciles with family. It would be interesting to see if that’s how it goes. It’s always fun to dream."},{"prompt":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","completion":"Here are some of the best science fiction novels: 1. \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert 2. \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card 3. \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" by Douglas Adams 4. \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" by Ursula K.

The original stir-fry was a technique using a wok. The wok was used because it requires the least oil. The cook put oil in the very bottom of the wok, the place with less area, drop whatever he wanted to cook into it and when done would push the cooked food up the side of the wok out of the oil and then cook the next ingredient and only at the end of the process would mix all the cooked ingredients.

Both of you.” For my loop-hole finding son: “You KNOW the rules. If you break them, there will be trouble/consequences.” “Do you want the lecture, or do you just want to cut it out?” And the one my teenagers eventually begged/pseudo-threatened/pleaded with me not to say again: “Failure to plan on your part, does not constitute an emergency on my part.” And finally the hardest trick there is to learn. It was doubly hard for me because I am a speech-pathologist and talking is my “thing.” That trick is: STOP TALKING. Give your child short, clear directives, then stop talking. Do not constantly explain yourself. I assure you that your child KNOWS the rules and 95% of the time KNOWS exactly what rule he/she has broken. This works for children starting at age 18–24 months. (I used it today on a 3 year-old language delay boy). I will repeat (because I am an SLP educator and am prone to repeating): Stop talking so much. Give your child brief instructions, then stop talking, stare at him/her, and point in the direction you want the child to go. You will be AMAZED at how well this works. This works for children starting at age 18–24 months. (I used it today on a 3-year-old language-delayed boy). As long as you talk; as long as the child keeps you engaged in a discussion about what you want done, the child is in control.

My favourite line from this book is — Chapter 2 Verse 47 — “You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.” In life we do not have control over the fruits of our actions, we can only have control over our actions but not the fruits. Now let’s understand this suppose there are two guys named “X” and “Y” who have to do the same work in a given period, but the guy “Y” started thinking of the result while doing the work, and he started worrying about his results. On the other hand, the guy “X” just focused on the work or his action without worrying or thinking about his results, he started working with full focus. What do you think who will get the better results in the end? There is no doubt that the guy “X” will get better results because he was working with full focus without worrying about his results. Similarly, if you are not attached to the fruits at the end whatever the result is you will not feel sad or happiness, because you were just focusing on the work, you are neutral. But on the other hand, if you get attached to the results then you start expecting the better results, and if for any reason you are not able to get the desired result in the end there are very high chances that you will get depressed and start feeling sad and doubting yourself. Keep on performing your duties without being attached to the result of your actions. Either you get something or you don’t get anything, you should not worry about it. You should have a neutral behavior. Thanks for reading.

(Source: File Photo) “Navratri” or “Navaratri”, is a synchrony of two words – “nava” (meaning nine) and “ratri” (meaning night). Clubbed together, it translates to nine nights. The festival of Navratri, which spreads over 9 nights and 10 days, is one of the most revered festivals in Hinduism and celebrated during the autumn season. It lays importance on the worship of Goddess Durga or Shakti, which represents the energy of the universe, in her nine different forms. Of the four kinds of Navaratris – Chaitra Navratri, Paush Navratri, Magha Navratri, and Sharad Navratri – celebrated in India throughout the year, Maha Navratri or Sharad Navratri is considered as the most auspicious. According to the Hindu calendar, the festival is celebrated in the month of Ashvin, which typically falls in September and October as per the Gregorian calendar. This year, Navratri will be observed from October 10 to October 18, 2018, and the 10th and last day will be celebrated as Dussehra. Importance and Significance of Navratri When it comes to the importance of Navratri, like every other Indian festival, the core message remains the same – the victory of good over evil – but the stories and the narratives differ. Even across the geography of India, while the eastern and north-eastern states refer to the celebrations as Durga Puja, for the northern and western belt, it is a nine-night festival that is observed to celebrate the victory of Rama over Ravana. It is believed, that Goddess Durga battled with demon Mahishasura and defeated him. To celebrate her victory and Mahishasura’s defeat, the day is marked to worship and honour the Goddess. The first day of the festival, Mahalaya, begins with remembering Goddess Durga. It marks the end of the period of Shradhh or Pitri-Paksha. On the sixth day, the goddess is welcomed into homes of people and pandals. The celebrations continue for the next few days and on the 10th day (Vijayadashami) the idol of the goddess is immersed in water. During these days, people get together, hop across pandals, feast on bhog and offer food to the needy – to celebrate and honour the good in everybody. In North India, the nine-day festival is observed to celebrate the victory of Rama over Ravana. For nine days, Ramlila (the mythological tale of Lord Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana) is enacted on stage, and on the tenth and final day, when Rama ‘kills’ Ravana with his bow, the festival is celebrated by burning effigies of Ravana and his brothers Meghnad and Kumbhakaran. During the festival, people dress up in traditional clothing, observe fasts, and offer prayers. Stage decorations, recitals of stories and the mythological legend, chanting of scriptures, prayers, and dances such as dandiya and garba are performed to keep in tune with the spirit of the festival. Families and friends get together to visit pandals and take part in the celebrations. On the final day, the idol is either immersed in water (in case of Durga Puja) or the effigies are burnt (in case of Dusshera)."},{"prompt":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: WordPress.com: Build a Site, Sell Your Stuff, Start a Blog & More] [URL: http://wordpress.com/] vs. [LINKED_TEXT: Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress.org] [URL: http://wordpress.org/] How to Build a WordPress Website Choosing A Hosting Package Setting Up A Domain Installing WordPress Choosing A Theme And Plugins Customize your website.

Rising global temperatures, changed weather patterns, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss have all been brought on by steadily increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which are mostly caused by burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Every aspect of human life, from ecosystems to economics, is impacted by this multidimensional issue, which crosses international boundaries. To reduce emissions, switch to renewable energy sources, improve sustainability, and strengthen resilience, urgent and concerted action is required.

Who's fault, selector, captain, or coach?","completion":"One thing which regularly comes to mind is when senior players are rested in the name of workload management, youngsters are roped in for bilateral series. Those team member perform, they win the bilateral series and then what? These rested players come back at their respective places. Not only this is unfair for those youngsters but also make them insecure. Moreover, the senior players know once they get back, their places are confirmed in the squad, they don't have that feeling that their spot is under contention and hence they might have become complacent. Then there is confused selections. You call Shami who hasn't played a single T20 since 2021 T20 WC. You take Chahal with you but he doesn't get a single game. You take Hooda but plays one game where he didn't even bowl. Harshal Patel doesn't even get a game. So you are playing with 12 people squad. And the last reason is too conservative of an approach in powerplays, even when the wicket is flat. Barring Virat or SKY, batting never looked threatening. And if you look at the matchups. Against Pakistan you narrowly escaped when Virat single handedly won you the game. Against South Africa you lost. Bangladesh too exposed your bowling. The big tests in league phases were Pakistan and South Africa where you almost lost and defeated respectively. Bangladesh too fought hard. 2 convincing wins were against lesser nations. You won't get Zimbabwe or Ireland or PNG in knockouts. You'll face the stronger oppositions. And one such strong opposition exposed and humiliated you.

After you have enough work experience you take the Professional exam, which is another 8 hour examination. When you pass that exam you are then a Professional Engineer ( PE). Now you are ready to begin. To succeed you must pay attention to detail and learn how to solve problems quickly and efficiently. The art of civil engineering is to arrive at a solution with the least cost and best outcomes. My favorite example: When NASA was starting the studies for putting a man on the moon they had to solve the problem of how to make a pen that would write in the zero gravity of space. They spent 50,000. The Russians who were also working on that same problem came across that same issue. They decided to use a pencil.

So I suppose the most important lesson I learned from them is that material success doesn’t guarantee happiness. Life’s too short to live it stressed out chasing after stuff. If I’d had kids, I would have encouraged them to follow their passions, explore the arts, go out and lie under the stars, question what others take for granted, ask why.

They invested heavily in content creation and distribution, securing exclusive deals with studios and producing critically acclaimed original programming. This move allowed them to differentiate themselves from competitors and attract a large subscriber base.Furthermore, Netflix understood the importance of personalization. They leveraged data analytics to analyze viewers' preferences and provide tailored recommendations, enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement. This data-driven approach further solidified their position in the market.Overall, Netflix's shrewd maneuver to transition from DVD rentals to streaming, combined with their focus on content creation and personalization, allowed them to reshape the entertainment landscape and become a dominant player in the industry.

Programming has the advantage of Students will get a chance to compete with various brilliant minds to enhance not only their programming skills but also logical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, and time management skills. But some students don’t have the right and effective path to get started with Competitive Programming. We will discuss the ideal strategic approaches which will help you to readily become familiar with competitive programming. Let’s get started:- Learn the Preferred Programming Language The competitive programming market has several languages suitable for programming including C, C++, Java, Python, and many more – however, C++ is the most commonly used language for competitive programming by students due to its faster execution time. Students can easily learn and get command over the targeted programming language by using various standard online resources. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms Data Structures & Algorithms are the fundamentals to start the journey of becoming a Competitive Programmer. Unless students are familiar with Data Structures & Algorithms, they will not be able to come up with an optimal, efficient, and ideal solution to a programming problem. Before solving problems and solving competitive problems, students should familiarize themselves with DSA fundamentals such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, and time and space complexity. This will create a sense of confidence and make it easier to solve a majority of the problems. Start Practicing and Solving Problems After learning the programming language and DSA concepts, it is time to put your knowledge into practice and start solving problems. Students must start solving beginner-level problems first because they will find difficulty in solving even these easy or beginner problems. Despite struggling, keep trying, and don't give up. Start Participating in Coding Challenges or Contests Having practiced adequate programming questions, your competency in competitive programming can now be assessed, validated, or demonstrated by participating in various renowned programming contests. Without a doubt, there can be no better way to become a great competitive programmer than to participate in coding challenges or contests as frequently as possible. LEARN, PRACTICE, AND PARTICIPATE! One of the most important things ignored by students is Consistency. Yes, It’s a continuous process, to master competitive programming – It’s required to keep learning, practicing, and participating. Get out of your comfort zone and expand your limits. As soon as you have mastered basic DSA concepts, move on to advanced DSA or solve problems at a beginner's level. So, Keep working at improving your weaknesses and keep participating by continually improving yourself. Good Luck."},{"prompt":"Can neural networks evolve other neural networks?","completion":"Recent paper by DeepMind claims something similar.

I faced multiple challenges along my learning journey, but now, having mastered the subject, and thence having bagged a high-paying Cyber Security Analyst job (US 97,800), fresh out of college at Airbnb, by attaining a CEH v11 certificate and showcasing to the recruiters my skills in Ethical Hacking and Python programming, I believe, I should put an answer to this question so as to make your learning less troublesome than mine. In my learning journey, I came to realize that a vast majority of resources available for learning Ethical Hacking - books, PDF material, are not learner friendly. I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the thought-process required to arrive at the logic behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with the Hacking environment. But, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner. Here, I am sharing the link to the course that helped me master Ethical Hacking, you would find it useful - [LINKED_TEXT: My Preferred Ethical Hacking Learning Resource] [URL: https://allaboutethicalhacking.quora.com/My-Preferred-Ethical-Hacking-Learning-Resource] I would bring to light that in my initial days of learning, I resorted to free video tutorials available online. But, over the time I realized that an issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Also, one cannot prove one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers due to no provision of obtaining certification for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate. Moreover, in several resources I found that while solving questions, the author applies logic/technique that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial, where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept discussed in a different section. Often, this is a repetitive cycle.

A metal fabrication might weight nothing in space, but then it picks up mass inside making it very heavy to move around. Inside, the asteroid would give the base some protection against radiation and micro meteorites. Asteroid course in space could be an issue aswell.

Prepare to be Mind-Blown with these Crazy Facts!\\" Are you ready to have your mind blown? Because I have some truly unbelievable facts that will leave you speechless. These facts are so incredible that they may even make you question reality itself. Buckle up and get ready for a wild ride as we explore some of the most mind-blowing facts out there. The Universe is Huge, like really HUGE Did you know that the universe is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter? That's billion, with a B! To put that into perspective, if you were to travel at the speed of light, it would take you 93 billion years to traverse the entire universe. That's mind-bogglingly massive! Your body is a Microorganism Hotel Did you know that your body is home to trillions of microorganisms? In fact, there are more bacteria living in and on your body than there are cells that make up your body. You're basically a walking, talking, microorganism hotel. So next time you think you're alone, remember that you're actually surrounded by millions of tiny friends. A Single Snowflake is Unique Did you know that every snowflake is completely unique? No two snowflakes are exactly alike, and that's because each snowflake forms in its own unique way. So the next time you catch a snowflake on your tongue, take a moment to appreciate its individuality. The Earth is a tiny grain of Sand Did you know that the Earth is just a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things? The Sun alone is 109 times larger than the Earth, and there are over 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone. That's a lot of cosmic real estate. The Tongue has its own set of Print Did you know that just like fingerprints, everyone's tongue has a unique print? This is because the bumps and ridges on your tongue, known as papillae, are arranged in a unique pattern that is specific to you. So the next time you stick your tongue out, know that it's a one-of-a-kind tongue. The Brain is a thinking machine Did you know that your brain can process information at a speed of up to 120 meters per second? That's lightning fast! Your brain is constantly processing information from your senses, making decisions, and carrying out complex tasks without you even realizing it. It's truly a marvel of nature. The biggest living thing on earth is a Fungus Did you know that the largest living organism on Earth is a fungus? The fungus, known as Armillaria ostoyae, covers an area of over 2,200 acres in Oregon. That's larger than 1,600 football fields! So the next time you think about fungi, remember that they're not just little mushrooms growing in your yard. Time Travel is Possible Did you know that time travel is technically possible? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time can be affected by gravity and motion. This means that if you were to travel at near-light speed, time would slow down for you relative to someone who is not moving. So the next time you're stuck in traffic, just think, you're technically time traveling. The Blue Whale is Huge! Did you know that the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth? The largest recorded blue whale was over 100 feet long and weighed over 200 tons. That's bigger than even the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. Now that's a big animal! The Earth is Flat, just kidding! Did you know that some people believe that the Earth is flat? I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous, right? We have all sorts of scientific evidence that the Earth is round, including satellite images, the curvature of the horizon, and even the fact that ships disappear over the horizon as they sail away. But hey, if you want to believe that the Earth is flat, go ahead and knock yourself out. The World's Deepest Point is in the Ocean Did you know that the world's deepest point is in the ocean? The Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean, reaches a depth of almost 36,000 feet. That's deeper than the height of Mount Everest! It's amazing to think about all the incredible creatures and ecosystems that exist in this mysterious, dark world. Humans and Dinosaurs Did Not Coexist Did you know that despite what some movies and TV shows may suggest, humans and dinosaurs did not actually coexist? The last dinosaurs died out around 65 million years ago, while the first humans didn't appear until around 2 million years ago. Sorry, Jurassic Park fans, but it's just not possible. The Speed of Light is Insanely Fast Did you know that the speed of light is insanely fast? Light travels at a speed of almost 186,000 miles per second. To put that into perspective, it would take just over 1 second for light to travel from the Earth to the Moon. That's mind-blowingly fast! The World's Oldest Living Organism is a Tree Did you know that the world's oldest living organism is a tree? The Great Basin Bristlecone Pine, located in California, is estimated to be around 5,000 years old. That's older than the pyramids of Egypt! It's amazing to think about all the history and changes that this tree has witnessed throughout its long life."},{"prompt":"w do you remove a household cleaner from your gas tank?","completion":"You have to have the tank removed and cleaned out if it was alot of cleaner.

Unfortunately, we had the largest submarine crew of over 200 sailors. In order to have meals work, we fed in groups. The first to eat are those going on watch. They eat quickly in order to relieve the watch and allow others to eat as well. With 30+ seats, by the time the last seat is filled, the first seats are empty. This allows a steady stream of sailors to get fed."},{"prompt":"What is the reason for the 4 seasons?","completion":"original question: What is the reason for the 4 seasons? The Earth is a giant gyroscope, its axis of rotation points to the same distant point in the universe. Well, like a gyroscope, it responds to torques by precessing. But on the scale of a human lifetime, it is a very, very slow change. Right now the northern pole star is Polaris. A year from now it will still be Polaris; last year it was Polaris; it is Polaris day after day, all year long. This means throughout the year, sometimes the north pole is closer to the Sun, sometimes further.

The propaganda was aggressive and censorship extreme but, in hindsight.… Compared with what I experienced in South Africa and read about the USA, Rhodesia was much milder. E.g. I recall being shocked when, shortly after crossing the border into South Africa, I was standing in a queue in a small shop waiting my turn when the white woman behind the counter started shouting at the black customers in front of me telling them to move out of the way so a white man could be served. Mixed marriages and mixed relationships were tolerated from what I recall (I knew at least one); we used to enjoy going down to the notorious Queens hotel in Pioneer Street, Salisbury (a hang out for prostitutes of colour) at night and count all the TJ (Johannesburg) number plates (there were a lot) - mixed relationships were illegal in South Africa so there was a lot of “bloody kaffir” during the day followed by “hello darling” at night from the South African whites. I asked a black guy what he hated most about the Rhodesian discrimination; his greatest lament was the law introduced that didn’t allow aliens (e.g. blacks who originated from Malawi or Mozambique) to live in Salisbury. Although morally wrong, this was intended to protect jobs for locals. Becoming more inclusive examples. 1. Mixed races in private schools emerging. 2. The BSAP (local police) were easing the discrimination on the basis of commissioned (initially reserved for whites) and non-commissioned ranks with the introduction of a new rank “sub-inspector”. Although structured in a way that whites weren’t directly subordinate, the societal respect was there. 3. Call ups into the army going into the bush were completely integrated, we fought shoulder to shoulder with black guys. 4. They were starting to introduce a system called “qualified franchise” where the right to vote was based on qualifications. 5. Commerce and industry were becoming increasing integrated. Possibly becoming more classist than racist. The Ndebele state that preceded Rhodesia practiced extremely brutal discrimination; the Ndebele colonizers were on offshoot Zulu warrior tribe that colonized Zimbabwe in the 1800s. The short lived Ndebele state relegated Mugabe’s ancestors to the lowest class. Mugabe’s ancestors were also relatively recent colonizers only arriving in the 1700s and they also seem to have been brutal; it seems the San were a hunk of the indigenous population so perhaps genocide accompanied that colonization as I haven’t seen any San around. The early years of Mugabe’s rule were extremely brutal with the Gukurahundi massacres where he put paid to Nkomo’s (Ndebele) claim of right to rule. So none of the rulers since 1700 can claim to be saints. The idea of black rule was completely abhorrent - the neighbouring countries Zambia and Mozambique were an absolute mess with completely corrupt inept governments. Kaunda was a patrimonial Kelptocrat - there is a really good Alfred Marshall lecture on how that pans out for an economy - if you want to read it its free, you just need to put Kleptocracy Divide and Rule in your search engine. We expected we would head along the same path - and that definitely panned out with Mugabe. I guess you can appreciate that, although Rhodesia was socially unjust, the concept of developing into an even more inclusive society may not have been too difficult to sell to the whites in society; the concept of black rule wasn’t an attractive option. In 1973 a policeman put this in a nutshell with the story “Gokwe council has autonomy and the black guys in the local government steal the cotton cheques, I arrest the culprit and the next guy steals, and so it goes on; I think my tally is about 2 dozen so far and there has never been an exception. The difference with a national black government is those guys don't get arrested.”"},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"Maa. Do you see her smiling?

The weight of a full bass isn’t really the problem. Even the heaviest models I’m aware of in your most conventional 4–6 string configurations are 15 lbs. That’s less than the backpack I wore in high school. Less than half the weight of the sousaphone I schlepped around on that same shoulder for 4 years. The problem is the shoulder strain. Several parts of your shoulder that bear the weight of the bass just don’t get any muscle over them no matter how well-built your upper body is. The aches from holding your arm out at the end of the neck all night will fade with time as your delts and traps tone back up, but my collarbone on the left side has been broken in two places, and no matter how much I build my pecs, the extra bone growth to repair that break (and the slight misalignment resulting from it being pretty much impossible to immobilize that kind of break) just can’t be padded over with muscle. Throw a seat belt over that, digging skin into healed bone, and hang pretty much any weight on it, and I’m gonna be pretty sore after a night. For that reason, all my basses wear an extra-wide padded strap, and I went that direction for my main “skinny-stringer” (electric guitar) as well, even though that’s a swamp ash Strat that’s well under 10 pounds. Levy’s and Perri’s both make really nice all-leather padded straps, I prefer the Perri’s one I have as the top layer isn’t figured, making the entire strap much more flexible and comfortable. At the time, both were about 50, but that was years back, so both companies have grown a higher opinion of their products and you’ll find similar straps as mine costing about 80 these days.

If it is difficult to use, it is not clear, or the information is hard to read or doesn’t answer users’ key questions, people choose another one. There are plenty of other websites available, at the least difficulty, people look for another web. The quality of the online relationship with your users and how well your website meets their needs has a direct influence on your bottom line. Nowadays, a business has to have a website. For people to actually use it, you will have to go beyond the traffic-attracting ad campaign. You need to build an accessible, inviting, and useful resource that would stand out among other similar websites. To achieve all that, however, you need to know about some nuances. For instance, the average length of time a user spends browsing a random website is 27 seconds. Not many people look through the pages on the site. That’s why it’s important that your resource is able to grab the user’s attention and make them stay longer, becoming more and more interested in what you have to offer. All in all, you have half a minute to show exactly your website is worth the attention at all. Here you can read about WEBSITE USABILITY CHECKLIST!

China has succeeded in bribing… ahem, influencing with money, many many politicians to subtly change the USA into a Chinese / New World Order vassal state replacing our Founding Father ideology and values with more and more totalitarian, non-tolerant dystopian attributes, with ever-increasing social restrictions pushed by violent groups funded by the sell-outs, like Soros and his puppets. They have no desire for the American people to understand our slide into Communisn/Marxism, so they flame the hysteria of their none-too-bright, emotionally volatile constituents by screaming that the Right’s push to return us to our founding principles and real freedom is “fascism” when it is not and never has been. But, our educational system was a first casualty of this slow coup so the ignorant hysterics have no real point of reference and are just echo chambers for their masters. So, refering to Democrats as Communist or neo-Bolshevik “useful idiots” is quite accurate. The fascism accusations are for deflection and are pure theater and inaccurate. As for “Russian bots” Russia ceased being Communist in 1991: which the Left conveniently ignores, while Russia has actually come out against our enemies and has been trying to warn us… i.e., about the New World Order Socialists and inbred Western elitists who want massive depopulation (mass murder) via contrived epidemics, contrived food shortages, contrived wars, contrived train derailments of toxic substances, contrived water poisoning, contrived farm animal slaughter (mass fires and energy weapons), contrived gas shortages via oil refinery fires, etc., etc., etc. So, the real Communists in the USA serving the Chinese and NWO would love to discredit a potential strong ally against them such as Russia. If we fall to the NWO/Communist China, and it looks like our weapons would be used by them to try to subjugate the rest of the world, like Russia, then Russia would launch supersonic nukes which we have zero defense against.

Okay I want you to design a soldier who can walk/jog 30 kilometers over rough terrain carrying 60 pounds non stop. He must also be able to swim/wade through 10 kilometers of swamp. Also he must be able to climb/scale mountain terrain while remaining inconspicuous. The ability to jump and roll from a vehicle traveling 30 mph as well as the ability to swim 5 miles to shore comes in pretty handy as well. This person needs to be able to deal with this for 18 hours on any given day with minimum rest and minimum required nutrition then do it again the next day.

Now ask yourself, out of all the guys you have seen pumping iron with heavy weights in any gym you have worked out in can you picture any of them able to do what I have outlined above? Such large muscular bodies are great on the body building stage but not suitable for or sustainable in combat scenarios.

Some of the commonly used Ayurvedic herbs for diabetes include: Gymnema Sylvestre (Gurmar): It is believed to regulate blood sugar levels by inhibiting glucose absorption and stimulating insulin secretion. Bitter Melon (Karela): It is rich in charantin, which has blood glucose-lowering properties. Fenugreek (Methi): It helps to lower blood glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Cinnamon (Dalchini): It may improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. Indian Gooseberry (Amla): It may improve glucose metabolism and reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes. It is important to note that Ayurvedic remedies should not be used as a substitute for conventional medical treatment. You should always consult your healthcare provider before starting any new treatment or medication, including Ayurvedic remedies."},{"prompt":"What are some first date tips?","completion":"First dates can be exciting, nerve-wracking, and full of anticipation all at the same time.

A coffee shop or a park are great options for a casual first date. II. Dress appropriately: Dressing appropriately for the occasion can help you feel more confident and comfortable. Make sure to dress appropriately for the location and weather. III. Be punctual: Being on time shows that you respect your date's time and value their presence. IV. Be yourself: Don't try to be someone you're not. Be authentic and let your true personality shine through. V. Listen more than you talk: Show interest in your date by actively listening to what they have to say. This will help you connect and create a more enjoyable experience for both of you. VI. Avoid controversial topics: Avoid discussing controversial topics such as politics or religion on your first date. Instead, focus on getting to know each other better and finding common ground. VII. Don't drink too much: Drinking too much alcohol can impair your judgment and inhibit your ability to make a good impression. Stick to one or two drinks and make sure to drink plenty of water. VIII. Be positive: Stay positive and avoid complaining or being negative. Keep the conversation light and upbeat. IX. Have an exit strategy: Have a plan in place in case the date doesn't go as planned. It's always a good idea to have an exit strategy in case you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. X. Follow up: If you enjoyed the date, make sure to follow up and let your date know. It's important to be honest and upfront about your intentions and feelings. Remember, the key to a successful first date is to be yourself, show interest in your date, and have fun!

It is something funny, an entertaining line that is like a mirror since it reflects casual talks from real life. Do you think it would have been fair for Anakin to go to Padme and start flirting like he has years of practise? No, I’d say it is rather realistic and fair decision that they’ve made with this scene, it shows constancy and truthfulness to Anakin’s character. You need to understand the movies and the characters since they are actually brilliantly written, their emotions and how they express them dignify the awesomeness of the prequel trilogy. There is this period : Anakin begun his Jedi training in a very early age, later than some other Jedi usually begin this path but still, very, very young. What matters is what happened during that time period I’ve pointed, it’s actually pretty simple - He had been trained in the Jedi ways and had no time to flirt with girls and therefore no way to gain an experience with dating and stuff, the Jedi do not allow attachments after all. But most importantly, Anakin’s quote isn’t stilted, it is normal and that’s because the Jedi taught him to suppress such emotions, yet when he went to Naboo with Padme he felt the need to express himself, it was like a psychological relief for him, a comfort. That is in-universe, while behind the curtain answer is that this scene is yet another hint and depiction of Anakin’s eventual downfall to the Sith design. It isn’t necessarily one big and substantive turning point for the character but it surely is a moment of comfort and break from the Jedi teachings and emotional suppressions. I don’t think this scene is so hard to fathom. Nothing unnatural and unrealistic about it, he is just expressing how he feels like when someone has something he wants to say to feel better. People seem to deem it like some kind of enigma. It is just a normal line."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"If you are interested in getting started in competitive programming, here are some steps you can take: Learn a programming language: Choose a programming language that you are interested in learning, and start learning the basics.

Regarding Lisbon, though, here are some pointers: What to see and do depends on what you enjoy seeing and doing (sorry about the cliché answer). If you’re a “top 10 sights” kind of person, the popular landmarks are concentrated near Alfama, at the Baixa-Chiado neighborhood, and in the Belém area. If you want to skip places where everyone else goes, I wrote about the six places to skip in Lisbon and where to go instead - almost the same vibe, but without the crowds ([LINKED_TEXT: Places to skip in Lisbon (and where to go instead)] [URL: https://www.tripper.pt/skip-in-lisbon])What to eat: custard tarts (the famous “pasteis de Nata”) from Pasteis de Belem or Manteigaria.

The human eye is not much use for judging distances accurately that far away. The atmosphere is extensively layered and away from the ground is mainly differentiated in large horizontal sheets which have different temperatures and humidities. We can see this readily because some of the layers show themselves when they reach their dewpoint and become visible clouds. I’ve seen countless skies with multiple layers of cirrostratus and altostratus making evident the variation in temperature and humidity that occurs aloft. These variations can occur even in quite close layers. I frequently observe and photograph skies which reveal thin humid layers differentiating themselves from air immediately above and below. These thin layers of air can show themselves as altocumulus lenticularis when forced to rise through their dewpoint by ground features like hills and mountains.

It’s late given the fact I get in bed by 10 P.M. I should be up by 6 A.M, latest! But last week I got bad food poisoning and the anti-biotics messed up my schedule. Also, the staying-in-home-all-day part made me think. It made me realize — what is important, what matters to me, and what doesn’t. I had been giving too much attention to the noise, the things in the background that don’t matter. I was forcefully making them matter. Now I got it right. I don’t want to reveal them here, but I’ll say this — sometimes your mind forcefully sweats the small stuff. Re-align fast or you’ll go down the drain. Before this food poisoning juju, I used to get up early just to work on my novel. Sometimes I’d work on short stories, sometimes on poems, sometimes on everything! I was distracted by so many projects, but I did wake up early, and I did do my work. But the food poisoning stuff made me realize — I don’t wake up in the morning just so I could write. I wake up in the morning because I somewhere to go to. As the clock hits 10, there are 10–15 children waiting, for me. They are really nasty kids. They hit each other and pull each other’s hair. They run around like new-born puppies! But they love learning. I teach them because I want to. It’s a real blessing to have an opportunity of imparting knowledge to kids. It’s a real blessing that I get to teach the future of our country. Yes, they are from poor families, but they don’t necessarily have to belong there. I also have some freelance work. It’s not much. Part-time work. I do it on my time. And it’s doesn’t feel like work (most of the time) because it’s writing work. And I love writing! My reason(s) for waking up in the morning is(are) - those kids, the characters in my novel, and freelance work. These wake me up, keep me fresh& sound, and give me the energy to get through the day. On another note, waking up early is work. Tons of willpower. So I am in the process of making a morning routine. My morning routine has only one task — To meditate the 1st thing in the morning. Meditating makes me more focused on — the things I have, what my day is going to look like, where I want to go. Doing it first thing in the morning is the best! Also, it’s a true blessing that I have access to a safe roof, clean water, and fresh food. I know one day it may all go away, snatched from my petite hands — because life isn’t fair. But then, it’s okay. I will deal with it when it comes to it. For now, life is easy because, well, life is a blessing.

One colonial country taking from another colonial country is not “cultural appropriation”.

I have ticked more conservative officials in elections than any other. I am also an evangelical Christian. Here is what I think: My American counterparts are idiots. Sorry but you have everything screwed up. Guns: they are never mandated in scripture. Jesus never waged a war. He purposely let the disciples carry a couple of swords just before his arrest between them, not one each. He wasn't going anywhere fully armed. Now don't you find that strange? Any war waged in scripture for a Christian is spiritual so any physical weapon is wrong. Self defense is not wrong per se. Owning a gun is no more wrong than owning a machete to owning a blowtorch or a baseball bat. Everything has a legitimate purpose but for what American conservatives describe it for, it will be a no. Abortion. I don't believe in just abortion. A foetus is a living group of cells certainly but it isnt a fully human person yet and that is the issue. Scripture is almost silent on this. So by this I take that to mean it can be both wrong and right. It depends on occasion. There is a sanctity of life but the foetus should never be precedent over the mother. No mother means no foetus but no foetus does not mean no mother. So under some circumstances I think abortion is acceptable under a grey area meaning it could be right or wrong. That is the mother's choice and perogative and she will ultimately be judged for it After a certain time of self viability I think it would be too late. I know there are Americans who will say this is hypocritical beliefs. I happen to know a bit more biology than average. I know for example the countless problems that can go wrong with living tissues. I happen to know that even sex isn't even strictly a binary determination at a biological level. It isn't just male or female as there are many more things under the hood that complicates but obviously that far deeper discussion for another time. But cellular development isnt linear. Things start off the same in the form of stem cells. At some point you see differentiation of cells and organ development. So to think that life begins at conception is rather dubious. Those cells could develop into a multitude of things or nothing at all. The environment can alter things. And comparing various animal foetuses with a human foetuses you couldn't tell. Fundamentally and biologically we are the same. So personhood is hard to determine other than a legal definition or arbitrary medical time. Doctors believe around 28 weeks is when medical viability has passed. There is no definition in scripture other than God is the source of life. He gives and takes life. But you can even argue the other way. Before conception. What about sperm? So if you masturbate and dump them is that murder too? Eventually it becomes a philosophical madness to for something we have no clear scriptural mandate for when we don't even fully understand life itself. There are plenty of other things we need to fix before we need to fix abortion on the possibility it could be murder. But but but someone will argue that God's creation will be destroyed. Yes but you deny God's sovereignty over all this. If you think that this is destroying a life that God made what do you suppose a gun will do? Or drugs or alcohol or junk food? How many Christians genuinely “honour” their body? Or honour life generally. What about after birth. You would not believe how quick they are to dump them straight after birth. No if you are going to support life before birth then you ought to follow through and support after birth to adulthood and of course no wasted sperm either!! If you cannot agree to that then you are not really pro-life. I believe the Bible when it says homosexuality is a sin before God's eyes. Strictly speaking it is referring to a sexual act between the same sex but all sexual activity outside of marriage is a sin and Christians are not sin free. We will sin just as much as gay people will. It is a fallacy to think we sin less just because we are not gay. We tend to breed a certain arrogance in this domain but that is not to be Christlike like we are commanded to be. When Christ came across “big” sinners in the Bible he did not explode at them and cast judgement of a lightning bolt to smite them. There was no fire and brimstone moments. Instead he just talked and reasoned them to sin no more. He was firm in his challenge yet gentle. They either did or didn't. They made their moral choice. We do well to follow likewise. But that leaves open the right for a same sex marriage to make sexual activity legitimate. Sorry but it does not work that way. God declared that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Husband and wife. Whichever way we chose to define here on earth is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. They can call it a marriage but it is a union. I will go as far as that churches should not be a place to get married or if so, it isn't something as defined by God. It is something else. So I would not ban gay “marriages.” I would call them unions and let them do so. We were all given free will to accept or reject god's word. We are not given a scriptural mandate to meddle in other people's freedom or lorde our thinking over them via coercion or law. That would be fundamentally wrong. As much as I fully believe Christianity is the truth (that you ought to believe it), I totally defend your right to believe otherwise. God gave us that moral choice to make. He did not force me to believe. He made it easy when my eyes were opened but it was totally my choice. Likewise I defend your right to choose. So I wouldn't push to end gay marriage but I wouldn't expect God to honour a gay marriage. If people want to call it so, I'm not going to go to war over it. I'll say my bit and get on with life. We'll do well to all do the same. Jesus did not spend a lot of time on this subject. He had much more to say on other things. The death penalty is wrong. I wouldn't endorse it. The fact that life is precious even if that person is a demon possessed evil maniac. Every human being has hope. Some people have had a hard life. How they behave sometimes had to do with their upbringing. Some people make bad choices on account of their upbringing or lack of it. If there was no moral guidance should they be put to death because they couldn't figure it out on their own. Put it this way, would you teach a child any arithmetic when they failed to add two plus two correctly? Are they so beyond the curriculum that you give up on them. The Christian response is no as well as any educator. So an evil sadistic killer has just as much opportunity to find forgiveness and salvation at some point in their life just as much as you or me. As evil as this sounds, God can forgive even the sins of a Hitler. We shouldn't think we can claim any moral superiority because we are not a sadistic evil killer. No we can't because in God's holiness, almost everything we think is so impure that we offend his holy laws all the time. To him, we are equally as evil as Hitler was, irrespective of how we feel or what commandments we physically break. To go for the death penalty is equivalent to being against pro-life. This is why American conservatives have been rightly labeled as not pro-life but pro-birth."},{"prompt":"What are some dangerous legal drugs?","completion":"Most, if not all of them.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","completion":"Yes, false surrender, only to then resume fighting the enemy when they make themselves vulnerable is a war crime. But, whether defined as a war crime or not (and the term ‘war crime’ is really a post-World War Two popular phrase, despite the Geneva Conventions being pre-existing), false surrender has always been considered a dirty tactic and generally condemned. I remember, as a young boy, reading lots of ‘Battle’ comic books. One story which I remember vividly was that of a Blenheim squadron in the RAF during the early war, which features the dastardly act of false surrender as a key plot point: During a daylight bombing raid over enemy territory, the Blenheim squadron (coded ‘YD’ on their fuselage) are heavily shot up by German fighters, with a couple of crew bailing out and being taken prisoner on the ground as the battle continues to unfold above them. One bomber, pursued and damaged by two Messerschmitts, suffers engine and hydraulic damage (unbeknownst to the enemy), causing the engines to slow and the undercarriage to drop. Taken as an act of surrender by the German pilots, the two fighters cease their attack, at which point the Blenheim’s engines regain power and the dorsal gunner makes two kills of the ‘escorting’ German fighters as they try to take it in to land as captives. The hero of the story, a captured British pilot, see this happen, as do his German captors, and fears for his life as he thinks the Germans will just summarily execute him in retaliation for such a cowardly act of deceit & treachery. In fact, they don’t; they are furious but remain true to their honour. The main span of the story unfolds as the squadron continues to be the focus of enemy attacks on missions. Even when flying with two or three other squadrons, the German fighters always seem to ignore other planes, going only for those with ‘YD’ markings as an act of vengeance. The story is resolved when the mystery of the ‘false surrender’ is uncovered (once the hero escapes back to Blighty, reporting what he saw) and the matter of honour is addressed in a suitably heroic fashion. Ultimately, however, the YD squadron is disbanded and reformed with different aircraft and new markings to end the hatred. So, that’s a fictional example, but there’s also a rather sneaky and dirty real case of false surrender from the American Civil War which I recall reading of: On the morning of January 31st 1863 two Confederate ironclads steamed out of Charleston harbour to attack the blockading ships of the Union Navy. The CSS Chicora first surprised and badly damaged the USS Mercedita, whose captain surrendered to prevent further losses to his crew. The Rebels paroled the crew of Mercedita, meaning that they had to surrender themselves as soon as they returned to base, taking no further part in military activities until ‘exchanged’ for Confederate prisoners. Mercedita’s captain and crew honourably did this. Coming to the aid of the damaged Federal ship, the USS Keystone State was next to feel the wrath of Chicora’s bow gun, being immobilised. At this point, she ran up a white flag and the Confederate ship stopped firing on her. However, once clear of danger, Keystone State opened fire on Chicora again*, violating the terms of surrender. No further action was taken regarding this, as the action soon drew to an end as the Federals broke off and retired, abandoning their blockade temporarily. Interestingly though, the Union accounts give no mention of Keystone State ‘un-surrendering’, nor did the Union ever acknowledge that the blockade was legally broken. It seems that, among the victor’s whitewash of events, the dishonourable conduct of one of their captains was swept under the carpet. *Detailed in the book ‘Ironclads at War’ by Greene & Massignani."},{"prompt":"Why are HDMI cords so expensive?","completion":"HDMI is a licensed standard, manufacturers need to pay to use the standard. However HDMI cables are not expensive unless you are buying a very long cable. HDMI is a digital signal standard. It replaces analog standards.

So manufacturers are trying to fool consumers into thinking these expensive HDMI cables will improve the quality of the signal the same way the analog counterparts did. Also manufacturers will attempt to markup the price of 'new' features like 4K cables. It is correct that HDMI 2.x 4K cables cost more but we are talking 8 compared to 5 for the older 1080p cables.

While there's no one-size-fits-all solution, incorporating a combination of healthy habits can lead to sustainable weight loss. Here are some of the best ways to achieve your weight loss goals: Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Fill your plate with lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid extreme diets and instead aim for a sustainable eating plan that you can maintain in the long term.Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes to prevent overeating. Using smaller plates and paying attention to hunger and fullness cues can help you avoid unnecessary calorie intake.Regular Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Find activities you enjoy to make staying active a pleasure, not a chore.Hydration: Drinking enough water throughout the day can help curb hunger and support your body's metabolic functions. Opt for water over sugary beverages to reduce calorie intake.Sleep Quality: Prioritize sleep as it plays a crucial role in weight management. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support your body's natural repair and regeneration processes.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to what you eat and savor each bite. Avoid distractions like screens while eating, which can lead to overeating by disconnecting you from your body's signals.Healthy Snacking: Choose nutrient-dense snacks like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Snacking can help keep your metabolism active and prevent overindulgence during main meals.Reduce Processed Foods: Minimize your consumption of processed foods high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial ingredients. These foods can contribute to weight gain and have negative effects on overall health.Set Realistic Goals: Establish achievable and realistic weight loss goals. Celebrate small victories along the way, as these can keep you motivated and focused on your journey.Stay Consistent: Consistency is key to successful weight loss. Rather than seeking rapid results, focus on creating healthy habits that will support you in the long run.Mind-Body Connection: Incorporate stress-reducing practices like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. High stress levels can hinder weight loss progress by increasing cortisol levels.Seek Professional Guidance: If you're struggling with weight loss, consider consulting a registered dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare professional. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual needs and goals. Remember, weight loss is not just about the number on the scale, but also about improving your overall health and well-being. Embrace a holistic approach that encompasses dietary changes, physical activity, and positive lifestyle habits to achieve lasting results.

Sushant actually not being there makes it lot more emotional. I bet no matter how strong you claim you are you won't be able to resist yourself from shedding tears, given that you are a human by heart and not just a mind that's governing body for survival in the rat race of life All I can say is the meaning of movie would be completely different if Sushant was alive. I would want you all to take a moment and appreciate all the blessings you have in life, at the end, over money or the materialistic possessions it's some unforgettable moments of happiness with your loved ones that remain with you. If you are blessed enough that you don't need to count your days,then make your days count and live every moment to the fullest. Nothing is eternal so don't miss an opportunity to acknowledge it and submit yourself to the tranquility of present,as it's really a present. Life's too short to crib about the problems, instead embrace it as a part of life which makes little things beautiful and merrier I know these words are consequence of certain emotional state that is bound to change and so is my thought process in accordance with situations I encounter but if given a choice to chose a state of mind I would indeed chose this painful bliss, something that drains you but still can't empty an endless reservoir that's within one. Live for a greater cause and don't remain confined by a mirage that makes you believe that happiness is achieving the best for you,it is only when you realise that life's also about making a profoundly positive impact in the lives of as many as you can and when you realise this from the deepest part of your being,inner peace is showered by the almighty. We are all blessed with certain privilege so whenever possible do use that to complete someone else's incompleteness. We all are flawed in some way or the other but only when we come together with an urge to complete others,our own void will automatically vanish. Peace is in togetherness and harmony.

I am a Brazilian born Japanese living in Romania. My grandparents are Japanese who migrated to Brazil in the beginning of the 20th century. My parents and I were born in Brazil and therefore have Brazilian nationality. So we are Brazilians of Japanese ethnicity. In Brazil and especially in the countryside of Sao Paulo state, Brazilian born Japanese are usually called \\"Japa\\" in a derogatory way and because most of the Japanese in the region work the land, \\"Japa\\" is practically synonym with \\"redneck\\". So even though my family lived in the city and my father was an attorney, I was considered a \\"Japa\\" . So because of my appearance I was never considered Brazilian even though I have Brazilian nationality. When I was 23 years old, I moved to Japan. Even though I look Japanese and after a couple of years living in Japan I spoke Japanese fluently, many Japanese considered me a \\"gaijin\\" (foreigner/outsider) in a derogatory way. Then after 14 years living in Japan, I moved to Romania where, because of my Asian appearance I am considered \\"Chinezu\\" (Chinese). I moved here in 2002, right when the SARS epidemic in China was all over the news. Because of it and because of my appearance, people in the town where I was living in that time (Ploiesti) didn't let me ride public transport or shop in the neighborhood shops. Every time I went out of my apartment I would meet people in the streets who would be hostile to me assuming that I must be a SARS infected Chinese or people who enjoyed mocking me by yelling in mock Chinese or hooting like Bruce Lee. So, in Brazil I was a \\"Japa\\". In Japan I was \\"Gaijin\\". And in Romania I am \\"Chinezu\\".

In fact, the Python and R machine learning libraries have the compute-intensive bits written in C and C++ already, for performance reasons (the reason you don’t see that big a difference between their performance and straight-up C++). The principle different in using C++ really is the difference of using a lower-level compiled language versus a higher-level scripting language. You’re going to find resources for most algorithms in most languages. The scripting languages are more convenient running analysese because they can be quickly modified without compiling and really very little concern about the underlying mechanics and types.

For example, I have a student who gets points based open his respect, learning and safety in class. This equates into a reward that they have selected (theirs is time to read quietly). There is a consequence at home as well for good or poor behavior. This student has really improved throughout the year. I would also try to get to the core reason of why your son is misbehaving.

It has nothing to do with sanitary reasons. Beards (as the rest of body hair) is more sanitary in people with good hygiene. And in people with bad hygiene, well, being shaved will solve nothing. For a host of reasons, beards fall in desuse in english speaking countries, not so much in other western countries. In my country, Spain, beards are a regular thing, and has always been (albeit a bit disliked by the fascist regime). Lately, in democracy, they have come very strong, and now beards are more common than a full shaved face. Same happens in many other countries.

Nietzsche, it seems, was not very much interested in Islam to the extent of doing “in-depth” studies in it, and when mentioning it, it was mostly in a rhetorical way. Arguably, he thought Islam was “more practical” than Christianity, which he thought “negates life” and is a “religion of pity.” I think that what he meant is that Islam is a “powerful” religion that deals with life in “harshness” rather than the presumed “lovely” nature of the Church (which, in practice, very much was never the case)."},{"prompt":"What is keeping commercial spaceflight from being readily available to the public?","completion":"Price. You can (or at least, recently could) go to the Russian company: [LINKED_TEXT: Space Adventures] [URL: http://www.spaceadventures.com/] and pay them tens of millions of dollars - and they’d fly you to the ISS for a 10 day orbital vacation. Around half a dozen people have already done exactly that - and one particularly rich guy did it twice already! So it is already “available” - it’s just a matter of price. Right now it’s costly because space flight is costly. The Russian Soyuz capsule can deliver cargo to orbit for about 20,000 per kilogram. So a human in a spacesuit - with enough food and water for 10 days is probably around 150kg - so the price is going to be AT LEAST 3 million. In practice it’ll be a lot more than that because 20,000 per kg doesn’t include the return trip and all of the training you’d need to be safely able to travel. The actual price charged for a 10 day trip is more like 20,000,000. So - ultimately - the need is to get that 20,000/kg down to a more reasonable number. If SpaceX’s BFR does what they claim - then they’ll cut that 20,000 down to just 75/kg…which suggests that maybe you could get yourself into orbit for 11,250…but probably, additional costs would push that up to 100,000. Still - that’s something that many people could afford. It’s not unprecidented for people to spend one year of salary on a “journey of a lifetime” vacation. So a LOT of people could afford a trip to space. Elon Musk has been talking about sub-orbital flights in the BFR coming down to about the price of a 1st class airfare. So it’s happening, gradually.

This makes them less practical for use in smaller civil jets, which are typically designed to be more affordable and cost-effective.Size: High bypass turbofans are typically larger and heavier than other types of jet engines. This makes them less suitable for use in smaller civil jets, which require lighter and more compact engines.Efficiency: High bypass turbofans are most efficient at high altitudes and high speeds. Smaller civil jets typically operate at lower altitudes and speeds, where other types of jet engines can be more efficient.Noise: High bypass turbofans produce less noise than other types of jet engines, but they are still relatively loud. This can be a concern in residential areas or near airports, where noise pollution is a significant issue. For these reasons, smaller civil jets typically use other types of jet engines, such as turbojets or turbofans with lower bypass ratios, that are better suited to their size, operating conditions, and cost requirements."},{"prompt":"What is the best army strategy for TH10 in COC?","completion":"H"},{"prompt":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","completion":"Submarines discharge any human waste into the ocean, pumping it out using the pressure of the ocean or with pressurized air."},{"prompt":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","completion":"Human Willpower could change perspectives of many and the following quote is apt here: “What is now proved was once only imagined.” - William Blake Take Bodybuilders, Athletes, Entrepreneurs, IAS officers (all UPSC aspirants also) etc. who give a test of willpower every day and their achievements speak for them. For a willpower, one has to forget all the short term gratifications to achieve long terms goals. Courage, mental stamina and determination are required to achieve high willpower. Also, It is proved through various studies and experiments that willpower could be learned and strengthened. Now I will directly jump to the best examples case wise: Bodybuilders Bodybuilding needs consistent efforts to be stronger, workout, lose weight and gain muscles. At any moment of your day or life, commitment to bodybuilding is always required. Bodybuilders track their calories, macros, exercise calendars, sleep records, supplement dosage, doctor visits, and N more things. They compete in different competitions and take several years to reach that level. Take an example of Ronnie Coleman [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #Cgenl](8 times Mr. Olympia). His rise to Bodybuilding was very slow that it took him 6 years to win the first Mr. Olympia title in 1998. Before winning the first Mr. Olympia, his record was as below: 1992 - Not even ranked during Mr. Olympia 1994 - 15th place 1995 - 10th place 1996 - 6th place 1997 - 9th place At the 1998’s Mr. Olympia, he defeated Flex Wheeler and then won 7 more titles consecutively. Now, this looks easy but it is not! It took him more than 4-5 years to even participate in the first Mr. Olympia competition. Think about those number of years when he must have been eating the same diet, doing the same exercises, getting defeated year by year and still maintaining the determination & courage to compete again. Athletes Athletes face defeat often throughout their careers and that drives them to success. Michael Jordan [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #pCmOV] is one of those stars who failed handsomely to become the one. He is referred to as the best basketball player of all time. He mentioned once, I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. He openly says that success was not a slam dunk for him and his first failure was when his name was not considered for the Junior varsity team and that pushed him to try even harder. Failures did not discourage him. During his initial years of growth, he was not considered among those with great talent to be successful in the future.

But at one point in his life, he was unable to pay his rent and his first character Oswald rabbit was stolen from him. He went bankrupt several times in his early twenties due to a cartoon series in Kansas City. He failed at becoming a Hollywood actor also. Even he was considered less creative without any imagination for a job in a newspaper company also. His Mickey Mouse character was rejected by MGM on the basis that women are afraid of mice and who knew that one day, this character would result into an empire which even Walt Disney wouldn’t have imagined. It took him more than 10 years to taste his first success. “All the adversity I’ve had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me… You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.” - Walt Disney [LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #eLjMB]Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) UPSC is one of the toughest competitive examinations in the world and where we have thousands of stories who can vouch for this, the story of Anand Vardhan [LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #iEfbC], is one of grit and belief.

He always treated all his attempts as one. Here Thomas Edison’s quote will add to the taste, “I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” In one of the interactions with UPSC aspirants, Anand said, UPSC will tell you your weaknesses, will keep you humble.

My husband as well as my sister and brother in law both, being in railways, maximum railway staff knew me personally, which made me troublesome several times in one way or the other. Some even visited our residence instead of the branch for their routine transactions and I was giving them services being a good banker-cum-friend. I brief one of the instances by which I was disgusted with myself for offering so much services. It happened like this. The wife of my husband's friend(say Mrs m) visited the branch for opening a Recurring deposit account. Since she was not having savings bank account , I demanded introduction which she could not give. I myself avoided to sign(as it might be a nuisance as I knew so many personally and every one demand that) so asked her to fetch the signature of my husband. My husband was at lunch break and was at home at that hour, she reached there, fetched the introduction signature and RD account was opened. Every month Mrs M began to reach my home at 9-9.30 asking me to deposit instalment thrushing cash in my hand telling that she didn't get the time to visit the branch. It continued for 20 months and RD was for 24 months. My husband got transferred to Bhopal and so I too applied for transfer. My husband was at gas agency to get the details of process to transfer the gas cylinder . Mrs M reached our home somewhat bewildered. When I wanted to know about her anxiety, what she told, made me dumb for a while. She told,” you are moving from here. What about my money that I deposited in your husband's account?” I was annoyed to give personal service to such a lady who is not only an educated fool but also unaware of other's sentiments.

Where do the VC’s get their money back if the companies have to close the books? I think the best investment any entrepreneur can make is in their own business."},{"prompt":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","completion":"The school system is based on passing, not learning. You are forced to learn about various subjects such as complex math, science that does not help you in adulthood, and tidbits of knowledge about the 1800’s. These things do not help the majority into adulthood, and instead forces students to learn the information to pass, and they soon forget it because this does not interest them. Riddle me this: Why do students have to learn information that will not help them later in life? Why are we forced (to get a decent job!) to know useless things? Students who decide to not learn useless information are punished, Why? Because the school system is broken! High school students in the state of Florida are required to pass the final exam in geometry (as well as Algebra, a freshman course.) What average adult needs to know the formula of a sphere or rectangular prism on a daily, or even yearly basis? Little to none. But every 16 year old is forced to take a class to teach this (this is a mild example, in geometry the students do way more complex formulas/math on a daily basis, all of which is useless to most adults. The last time most adults remember using SOH-CAH-TOA was in high school! The schools teach you to regurgitate information instead of learn it. They give you busy worksheets nailing information into your head instead of giving you the resources to learn it on your own. The part that stings me the most is that while you are busy taking state mandated complex math courses, you aren’t learning practical skills to help you in life. Most new high school graduates (around 18–19) do not know how to pay bills, file taxes, or cook. Can you believe this bullshit? They force you to take a class that warns you of obesity but don’t require you to take a class that teaches you how to cook healthy meals (the food you eat is vital to staying healthy, just as important as working out regularly.) That is fucking unbelievable. In conclusion, I despise the USA’s public school system because it focuses on information regurgitation rather then how to learn, and forces you to take bullshit complex math and science classes rather then teaching you how to be a functioning member of society. *I would like to add that I have learned more from the internet and books on my own then the public school system has taught me through compulsory education. I pass my classes to look good to future employers, not because I consider graduating high school something to be proud of. School should get it’s students excited about learning information, and rather makes the majority to learn to despise it. I believe that school is important, but it should be reformed to teach students to learn how to make it in the real world. I should be excited to go to school and learn something new, and rather has grown to despise it so much that I am making every effort to graduate early just go get out of the hellhole that it is."},{"prompt":"English is an almost grammarless language. — Richard Grant White.

It involves optimizing various elements and factors directly within the webpage to make it more search engine-friendly and relevant to users. On-page SEO focuses on both the content and HTML source code of a page. Here are some key aspects of on-page SEO: 1. Keyword Optimization: Conduct keyword research to identify relevant keywords and phrases that users are likely to search for. Incorporate these keywords naturally into the page's title tag, meta description, headings, subheadings, URL, and within the content itself. However, avoid overstuffing keywords, as it can negatively impact user experience and search rankings. 2. High-Quality and Relevant Content: Create original, engaging, and informative content that satisfies the intent of the user's search query. Ensure that the content is well-structured, easy to read, and provides value to the audience. Use relevant headings, bullet points, and formatting to enhance readability. Including multimedia elements such as images, videos, and infographics can also improve the user experience. 3. Meta Tags: Optimize the meta title and meta description tags to accurately describe the page's content and entice users to click through from search engine results. Keep the title tag concise (around 50-60 characters) and include the primary keyword. The meta description should be compelling, concise (around 150-160 characters), and also contain relevant keywords. 4. URL Structure: Create user-friendly and search engine-friendly URLs that are descriptive and easy to understand. Include relevant keywords in the URL to provide search engines with additional context about the page's content. Avoid using lengthy, complex, or dynamically generated URLs that may confuse users and search engines. 5. Header Tags: Utilize header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure the content hierarchically and help search engines understand the page's structure and key topics. The H1 tag should typically include the primary keyword and represent the main heading of the page, while subsequent heading tags can be used for subheadings and further organization of content. 6. Image Optimization: Optimize images by using descriptive filenames and alt tags that include relevant keywords. Compress the images to reduce their file size without sacrificing quality, as faster loading times can positively impact user experience and search rankings. Image captions and surrounding textual content can also provide context to search engines. 7. Internal Linking: Incorporate internal links within the content to guide users to other relevant pages on your website. Internal linking helps search engines discover and index pages more efficiently and distributes authority and ranking power across the website. Use descriptive anchor text that includes relevant keywords to provide further context. 8. Mobile-Friendliness: Ensure that the webpage is mobile-friendly and responsive, providing a seamless user experience on various devices. With the increasing number of mobile searches, search engines prioritize mobile-friendly pages in their rankings. Optimize the page layout, font sizes, and touch elements to accommodate smaller screens. 9. Page Loading Speed: Optimize the page's loading speed by minimizing unnecessary code, compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and utilizing content delivery networks (CDNs). A faster loading speed improves user experience and can positively impact search rankings. 10. Schema Markup: Implement schema markup, also known as structured data, to provide search engines with additional information about the content and context of the page. Schema markup helps search engines display rich snippets and enhanced search results, providing more visibility and attracting users' attention. Remember, on-page SEO is an ongoing process, and regular monitoring, analysis, and optimization are necessary to maintain and improve search engine rankings."},{"prompt":"f Thatcher is so hated, why did Sky News Australia say Britain became great under her and said they liked her?","completion":"She had to take some hard economic decisions and because of this some people suffered and of course those who suffered hated her"},{"prompt":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","completion":"The human body contains enough DNA to stretch from the sun to Pluto and back — 17 times.2.

There is no such thing as an invisible entity that survives the death of the flesh. All such teachings have been well documented by secular and religious references to be rooted in Platonic philosophy and false religions. Of course the Bible does explain the only hope for all humans who have died to live again. This is not compared to “an afterlife” as believed to happen after the moment of death, but it is a general resurrection in what Martha called “the Last Day.” John 11:24 What did Martha mean when she said that Lazarus would rise on “the last day”? Well, Martha had heard about Jesus’ promise: ‘All those in the memorial tombs will come out.’ (John 5:28, 29) So “the last day” is when all those in God’s memory will be brought back to life. This last day is not a 24-hour day. It will be a thousand years long. On this day, the Bible says, ‘God will judge the people of the earth.’ The ones he judges will include those who have been resurrected.—Acts 17:31; 2 Peter 3:8. Think about what a wonderful day this will be! During this thousand-year-long day, many millions of people who have died will be brought back to life.

In the approximation that the atomic nucleus is a point, then that electric field is discontinuous at the nucleus of any atom. In quantum mechanics, we have the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which says that we cannot know the location of that atomic nucleus exactly. However, we do not need to worry about this on the scale of a PN junction, which is a few atoms thick. Saying that the electric field is discontinuous is a sufficiently accurate approximation."},{"prompt":"w do I make group calls in WhatsApp?","completion":"5 Latest WhatsApp Update: What’s New?

I love librarians. They are the smooth asphalt on a writer’s road. A research librarian is worth her or his weight in gold in my humble opinion. I wrote the following a few minutes ago and I offer it only as containing some practical experience gained through more than 30 years of being published and many experiences of soul-searing pain. Do not just start writing text. Write an outline. In older days thesis directors and editors commonly wanted an outline, but not much now (although as to editors it may still be the case for less established writers). I have never completely followed an outline because the actual writing, additional sources, ideas, finding a weakness in reasoning and other events may not appear at first. I write a lot of law-based stuff and between the Supreme Court and Congress, I am never at a loss for needed updates. But an outline gives you a general structure and, in my case, gives me a feeling of being in control. The problem of “what next” is solved in the outline, not four chapters later. That said, don’t feel bound by the outline. A work of writing is every bit as creative as any other artistic endeavor, so expect evolution as the work begins to appear.Hopefully you will not experience the ARRRRRGHHH moment, but if you keep writing it will happen. That is the sound of a writer who just discovered a previously unknown source, someone else’s research, or just has an old-fashioned apotheosis that makes some portion of the work erroneous. It happens. Deal with it honestly. That’s what extensions of deadlines are for. Never, ever compromise on the integrity of your work. P.S. If ARRRRGHHH is followed by further screaming, however, that means an electronic failure. I am so old that my first published work was done on a state-of-the-art Selectric typewriter, when a backup copy could be either carbon paper or photocopying, but computers, hard drives, software, fails. Back up everything to a separate source, preferably a server somewhere else. Pay for the larger storage capacity of one of the major online services. I once lost a 147-page article in the final edit. Now my work is backed up to a remote server every 30 minutes because I don’t get paid more if I have to rewrite.Write some every day. There is a sort of flow to writing and thinking is more difficult to start back up when there is much of an interruption. My late husband told me that, when I was writing, he could discuss something and either just get a vacant look, or no response at all, then an hour or so later, I would answer. To me, it felt as if no time had passed. I suspect that what he said (and we are talking about the finest man to walk the earth) went into a corner of my ROM, where it stayed until there was sufficient free RAM to process it - apparently without a time stamp.Do not drink alcohol. Ever listened to a couple of drunks in a bar? Your thesis can read like they sound, or just never be finished, if you use alcohol as fuel. Eat lighter, healthy food at least once a day. My live-in caregiver is an excellent cook and as a diabetic, is big on fruits and vegetables. She puts down a plate three times a day, so I eat regularly and more healthy than I would left to myself. It does make a different. Drink juice and take vitamins. In the interest of fair disclosure, I should mention that I passed the bar on a diet of popcorn and cokes, so I am speaking here from later experience.Never mistake the first complete draft for the last one. Have your work read by another person, or read it yourself. The last edit by the writer is, for me, where the quality of the work comes together. I have literally thousands of pages in print and I am well past the stage where I think every word is golden, but on the other hand, my work is honest and readable. The embarrassing stuff has long since been edited out — for the most part by me. Never be tempted to send in that awful first go-round just to get the thing off your desk. You will be sorry, I promise.Hiring a service to write for you is, I am aware, something of a growing industry. I have never used such a service. I believe my loyal readers expect that what they read will be my work, not that of someone else. If you write a thesis or dissertation, don’t you think your professor expects that the work presented will be yours? Your professor or director or editor can make suggestions, but in the end it is your name on the page, and as a matter of scholarly integrity, it is your mind that the reader wants to see."},{"prompt":"Which is the best abroad educational consultancy for studying in Germany?","completion":"A good educational consultancy is one which counsels a student on all the possible options which are most suitable for them and take care of them until they reach their destination.

Now, I know you may be thinking “well people do that all the time.” And, you’d be right. People run to raise money all the time because of people like Terry. Terry was diagnosed with Ostersarcoma, which is bone cancer. His right leg was amputated, and he thought that it was ridiculous that we hadn’t cured cancer yet. So, at the cost of his own health (and likely his life) he raised nearly 2 million dollars in his run across Canada. He had to stop at Thunder Bay after trekking more than 3,300 miles, and be treated (as the cancer in his body had now spread to his lungs). He could not continue running. Terry Fox died at the age of 22, but today if you are diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, your rate of success is nearly 70 or 80 percent chances of survival[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-remarkable-displays-of-selflessness-witnessed-in-sports] .

He did not now that it was a result of alopecia. She has publicly said she embraces her baldness. Will Smith laughed at the joke but when his wife rolled he eyes. He left his seat went on stage and slapped Chris Rock across the face. After that he went back to his seat and yelled repeated obscenities at Chris Rock who handled the situation like an adult.

Tigers won in 7 and had the last 31 win pitcher Denny McClain. Mickey Lolich a left won 3 games in the 1968 World Series.

Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","completion":"Her reaction to Viserys death isn’t an indication of madness, it’s an indication of her pull toward righteous cruelty. And you are right to make a connection to Sansa because she was also displaying righteous cruelty. Dany’s shown far greater tendency than Sansa along these lines, but they and many other characters show this characteristic and we should see them all in a similar light, to varying degrees of brightness. Back to the notion of “mad” then. It’s not uncommon for a “mad” person to demonstrate righteous cruelty, but that tendency alone doesn’t typically make us think of that label. Joffrey and Ramsay weren’t mad, they were just sadists. What makes Dany “mad” is this attribute in conjunction with her bizarre logic. It’s one thing to kill all of King’s Landing because your goal is to win no matter what, and it’s quite another to call it “mercy” and continue to talk about yourself like a messiah while you do so."},{"prompt":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","completion":"For abolutely awesome lip smacking mutton biryani, go to Sahib Sindh Sultan. https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/sahib-sindh-sultan-koramangala"},{"prompt":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","completion":"There are so many great science fiction novels that it's difficult to narrow it down to just a few.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"No. Let’s take the example of Sydney, Australia. In Sydney, Australia, the only private school even scratching the top of the bunch is called Sydney Grammar. All the other schools that dominate the list are called “selective schools”, which are essentially public schools but they take in gifted/hardworking students instead. They might contain students who might come from more privileged backgrounds, however they are not private schools.

The Gibson Les Paul Standard, the Fender Telecaster, and the Fender Stratocaster are the 3 main contenders. The Les Paul is found in every main genre of electric guitar music; jazz, rock, country, and all their subclasses. The Fender Stratocaster “Strat” has been traditionally more of a rock guitar starting with Buddy Holly, then the Surf-rock groups of the 50s-60s like the Ventures, then going out of style for a bit during the British Invasion but getting a re-birth with the advent of Jimi Hendrix all making extensive use of the guitar’s tremolo/vibrato. The Fender Telecaster “Tele” while being found in various forms of playing, enjoys a reputation as a great country instrument. You would be hard-pressed to find any great country picker who hasn’t used a Telecaster for some part of their career, except for the fingerstyle players like Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed who used acoustic/electrics or just acoustics. In the ‘60, with the British Invasion and groups like The Beach Boys, even studio aces like the guitarists in the Wrecking Crew started using Telecasters. All this being said, each guitar can crossover to any other’s styles. I had a teacher who played for the CBS orchestra and used a Telecaster where I expected to see him with an ES175! Hendrix occasionally used various Gibsons and country players can really use anything. Since the ’80s there has been a new contender on the block, but not around long enough to establish itself as a classic, that being the Paul Reed Smith “PRS”. These are excellent guitars, widely copied, expertly crafted, and hitting every price point. In the years to come it will also be known as a classic in body shape and design.

Having said that, I don't think PHP is bad, it's actually a good tool for rapid web development.

The potential difference remains the same, no matter how much water you have pumped to a height of 10m but there is more total potential energy if you have more water up there. The height is analogous to the height difference. The charge is similar to the total weight of water up there. In a capacitor if you double the electric potential you also double the charge thus here your intuition is correct. In a rechargeable battery you charge from 50% to 100% and the potential difference remains almost the same."},{"prompt":"What does a CEO of a startup do? What does a typical day look like?

Let me tell you all the differences and information about granite and marble. [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite]: Granite is a common type of felsic intrusive volcanic rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray, depending on their mineralogy. The word \\"granite\\" comes from the Latin granum, a grain, about the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. People have used granite for thousands of years. It is used as a building matter, a dimension rock, an architectural stone, an embellishing stone, and it has also been used to fabricate a wide variety of products. [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble]: Marble is a versatile rock formed when limestone is reduced to high pressure or temperature. In its pure form, marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance, consisting of calcium carbonate. Normally, marble contains other minerals, including quartz, graphite, pyrite, and iron oxides. These minerals can give marble a pink, brown, gray, green, or variegated coloration. While true marble forms from limestone, there is also dolomitic marble, which forms when dolomite experiences change. Now let's discuss the differences between [LINKED_TEXT: marble and granite] [URL: http://www.stonedepotgh.com/]: Durability: Granite is comparatively harder and more durable than marble. Marble is also responsive to fading of color and becoming duller overtime. Unlike the stains which can be removed, a dulled marble has no way of getting its shine back.Resistant to acidic foods: Both natural stones have an acceptable structure but the metamorphic attributes of marble make it more permeable and therefore marble is easily stained from spills especially from liquids that are acidic like fruit juices and wines.Appearance: The appearances of both marble and granite are quite different from each other.Cost: Granite and marble both are to be installed by professionals as the slabs are really heavy. The approximate cost for both marble and granite is 40 to 150 however high-end granite is cheaper than its counterpart marble. It depends upon the quality of the stone.Low maintenance: Sealants are used on both granite and marble to prevent staining and etching. Marble requires sealing much more frequently i.e. twice a year whereas for granite sealing once every two years is sufficient. That's all the differences between granite and marble. I hope you'll like my answer. Thank-You."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","completion":"1.

Idli has several variations, including Rava idli, which is considered to be much healthier. Pav Bhaji is a very famous dish of Maharashtra. There is an interesting story about its history, during the 1850s when cotton mill workers in the city had to work for long hours and would often miss their meals and remain hungry. So pav bhaji was that easy quick meal that was invented to feed these workers during those times. Personally, one of my favourite dishes if served with onion and cucumber.

Sensitivity. An INFP’s sensitivity is one of their most overlooked strengths. That’s because many people see sensitivity as a weakness. Sensitive people are aware of subtle cues as the moods shift in those around them. INFPs will use this information to help make loved ones comfortable and offer to help or listen when a friend needs a shoulder to sniffle on. Sensitivity gives an INFP access to a heightened sense of instinct, which is handy for keeping them safe, helping them realize when a person or situation may turn potentially harmful. I personally feel that if more people were sensitive and empathic there might be less violence on this world. If a person has felt pain, they wouldn’t wish to inflict that same pain on someone else. Individuality. Not wishing to conform. In many aspects of society, doing what everyone else is doing is considered acceptable. This begins in school, where children are taught how to act based on schedules - when to do what activities and for how long. This basically overwrites their natural personality with ‘the new norm’. (It’s really just early conditioning so they become accustomed to adult work schedules, but that’s another story.) Even as children, we’re taught that being different brings negative attention. The quiet person gets pointed out by the teacher for not taking part in group activities or for not offering to speak like the other kids. Unless the child learns to conform, this sort of bullying may continue throughout the child’s entire school experience - from adults and fellow students alike. I learned at a young age that asking for the reasons behind what we were supposed to do brought me instant dislike from those present. Because everyone knows you must do what you’re told without question. 😕 I was not one of those people. And the more I was not given a satisfactory answer, the more I tended to do or not do it anyway. I had a hard time with performing an action for its own sake. If the answer was “because I said so” or “because you need to”, I was less inclined to do what they wanted. I’m sure you can see, from a potential majority viewpoint, how this genuine behavior might be ridiculed. The people in charge can’t have an individual who thinks for themselves. That might disrupt everything. 😞 Yet INFPs are known for remaining true to themselves, and this truth has probably brought them a great deal of pain. 🥺 So, Sensitivity and Individuality are a few of an INFP’s strengths that some may view as weakness. As a result, we INFPs have needed to adjust our natural selves in order to survive. Either by hiding our beautiful traits to protect ourselves, or remaining genuine and being bullied for it. I acknowledge all of you dearest sensitive and genuine INFPs. I respect and admire you just the way you are. 💗 Thanks for the question. 😊 Related questions-[LINKED_TEXT: What are the disadvantages of being an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-being-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why is it so hard for an INFP to open up to people about their true feelings?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-hard-for-an-INFP-to-open-up-to-people-about-their-true-feelings/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What is an INFP's true self like?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-INFPs-true-self-like-How-do-they-behave-and-come-across-as-at-that-time/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What are harsh truths about being an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-harsh-truths-about-being-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: How can an INFP tell when someone is genuine?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-can-an-INFP-tell-when-someone-is-genuine/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why would most people not really want to be an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-would-most-people-not-really-want-to-be-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What makes it so hard for a Fi dom to show his/her true self to people, specifically INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-makes-it-so-hard-for-a-Fi-dom-to-show-his-her-true-self-to-people-specifically-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why is it so stressful to be an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-stressful-to-be-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: How does an INFP stop being sensitive?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-INFP-stop-being-sensitive/answer/Kalli-Noble-1]"},{"prompt":"w is Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ racist?

Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"prompt":"w do I unlock a SIM card on my son's phone?","completion":"You can’t “unlock” a SIM card; they are already unlocked for their purpose of connecting to the network vendor that you bough the SIM from.

Most people confuse the Persian people with the Iranian people. The Persian people are but one of many different ethnic Iranian people. Take, for example, the Kurdish who are ethnic Iranian people who speak the Kurdish language. The Lur people are another ethnic Iranian people who speak the Lur language. Take the Tabari people who are yet another ethnic Iranian people who speak the Tabari language. Iran has always been home to many different people and languages. Take for example the Azari people. They are Turkic but due to their closeness to the Iranian people, they are sometimes considered ethnic Iranian people. They speak the Azari language. We can keep going until you understand my point. The ancient Iranian people (e.g., Medes, Pahlav, Parsig) also had their languages. When Kourosh established the Hakahmanesh Empire, he established the first multiethnic Empire in human history. Many people came and went and they brought their language and culture with them. Kourosh allowed people to speak their language, and practice their religion in his new Empire. There never was one language. Even Middle Persian itself used the Aramaic script like old Persian which used the Babylonian script. Also, Iran is known as Persia in the West.

But after growing those middle man will come and tell farmers that ok I'll give you 15k for 1 acre. This is what the reality is happening for farmers in our country. They have invested 50k but sells at 15k.they are not even getting what they have invested. Then y shld they grow? Y no one are standing for farmer's? Atleast they should get what they have invested. Farmer's in our country are not happy, they suffer a lot but still they do farming bcz they only know to help people but what government is doing to them?

Some farmers did, but not all in NewZealand/Aotearoa. I think my father was so unhappy about having been conscripted for WWII that he didn’t ever want to have a gun around.

Until the ship rolled over and sank in the first heavy weather it met. The designers of the Nelson class had to make some compromises, and that is one they didn’t want.

The techniques for wake induced lucid dreaming and astral projection are identical, and all the same principles apply. There has been no evidence confirming the veracity of literal astral projection (actually leaving one’s body and traveling outside it), while there is plenty of evidence to prove lucid dreaming. If literally leaving one’s body were indeed possible, can we not set up an experiment for it? A person could prove they have the ability to astral travel via remote viewing and then reporting the information they have perceived outside their proximity. If they can get the information right, voila. Until then, I remain skeptical. I’ll also address a common defense of astral projection. People often say that astral projection feels too real to be a dream (“more real than real”), but I think they are underestimating the brain’s ability to create convincing realities. The “reality” you perceive right now is created by your brain. Everything you perceive is the result of your brain interpreting information and thus creating a world inside your head. When you look at your hand, you are not seeing your hand; you are seeing the image your brain creates in response to the photons that reflected from your hand and hit your retinas. So if our brains are constantly rendering an inner world predicated on external “cues”, why can it not create an even more rich and vivid reality without any of the cues?"},{"prompt":"On Yom Kippur the Jews ask for forgiveness from other Jews.

With all this rage and anger why doesn't he thrive on destroying things like DC's Doomsday, instead of wanting to be left alone?","completion":"Hulk is an embodiment of rage and where this rage comes from are from different places, now that doesn't mean all Hulk wants is to keep raging out. Hulk feels no one trusts him, that no one understands him and most of his so called friends and people in general see him as a monster when all Hulk wants is for people to see him for him and not some dumb smashing machine, Hulk notices this. You have to understand where hulk is coming from since he came into existence all Hulk has known is war, fight, people are constantly trying to hunt him, to use him as a weapon and sometimes all he wants is just for people to trust him but he's scared of trusting people due to his past experience with people. The rage in him is not something he has control over, it's like for example I create a physical form of one of your emotions be it sadness, happiness it wouldn't have control over it's self and would constantly keep being what it is. In all honesty Hulk is good at heart and he wants to be seen as a hero but instead people see him as a monster. And that's why whenever he finds someone who truly loves him for him and isn't scared of him he can go all out for that person(e.g betty, rick Jones to name a few) for them? He'll absolutely destroy whatever threatened them. Hulk is good at heart he doesn't go out of his way to kill people but people keep coming after him and he just wants peace, that's why especially during the WWH story When Hulk got to sakaar he finally found a place where he felt he belonged, a place where people weren't scared of him, a place where people saw him as a champion. He also found a wife, who loved the Hulk so dearly and saw that there was more to this brute and saw past his physical strength,and am sure we all know how the story went on after she died hulk went back to earth unleashing hell on those who he thought were responsible. So you see Hulk isn't some mindless brute, he has emotions and feels, so most times when you see him saying he wants to be left alone it's due to the struggles he's been through 🏴"},{"prompt":"Does it mean anything if a guy sends you “Hehe” while texting you?","completion":"It means he is laughing.

Basketball was more physical back then. Hand checking was also allowed (which was also banned around the same time) and, no doubt about it, so was the “body checking” that went on when guys came into the paint - many of which would be flagrants now and even ejections. Teams ran their offenses through those great centers that were more dominant back then. Power forwards too. It seems to me there was also more movement in the half court games of those “ancient” teams vs guys standing out there on the perimeter ready to hit the 3 like they do now - even centers. So while the 3 point rule added a level of excitement and the rules vs physicality added to the opening up of the game more, these rules also, overall, decreased the battles inside the paint, and dramatically changed the role of the center in the NBA."},{"prompt":"f Kim Jongun is dead, then why aren't they declaring it in the open?","completion":"Posted April 29 2020: Because totalitarian regimes usually have to sort out the next leader due to the grip of Power held by Last Despot.

I'm 16 and I smoke about 14 cigs a day so far. If my mom is right, why would I bother to quit?","completion":"If you want to find an excuse for your addiction, you always will. And that is being said by a smoker. However, I'm an adult, I'm aware of the risks and I'm responsible for my own health. I don't know what's going on in your life that you feel the need to smoke at such age ( yeah, you feel like an adult but your brain development doesn't agree on that). Why would you bother to quit? To not regret that stupid decisions when you're older and you're addicted. To not waste money on something that only brings you momentary pleasure and relief. You know it's bad for your health but that hardly ever is enough to give anybody the motivation to quit. You must want to stop smoking. The sad point is that even after quitting smoking , your body will need years to get to the point of you having the same odds with many health issues as somebody who's never smoked. If you have the motivation you'll work on that, if you don't, you'll use it as an excuse to keep smoking because now what's the point. I started smoking when I was nearly 18( so the legal age here). I didn't smoke 14 cigs a day back then. Hell, I'm almost 40 and now it's when I do smoke a pac a day. However, I switched to electronic devices and heated tobacco to at least eliminate the many “great “ things that the tar like substances are responsible for. I did quit a number of times in my “career\\" of smoking. It may seem hypocritical of me to advise you to stop but I do smoke as way of coping with s*it phases in my life. It's my last resort to survive to put it frankly. I wish I hadn't learn that it's an option when I was young and rather dealt with problems in a healthy way. And I know I'll quit again once I get my life back on track. You're starting your life so please don't go this path and don't use your reasoning to keep on something that will only bring you troubles and gets much tougher with time. Ps. I don't know how you can afford almost a pac a day when you're 16 and I assume you can't work legally.

There are several terms you should be familiar with when it comes to the Graphite application. Let's start at the top: The Graphite web application is the heartbeat - the place where users can come to create graphs and plot data. This web application allows users to save graph properties and layouts. It's a valuable tool for any organization.Carbon is the storage back-end for Graphite. This is a \\"daemon\\" that gets configured to run on TCP/UDP ports. If there's an increasing load and configure application and sharding, you can even deploy multiple carbon daemons on the same hosts, multiple hosts, or a load-distributed element using carbon relay.Whisper is the database format that Graphite uses to store data. The benefit of Whisper? It allows for higher resolutions (seconds per point) of recent data to degrade down into lower resolutions. This means long-term retention of historical data.StatsD is another element that needs to g talked about alongside Graphite. This node.js application allows for the transmission of data points about networks, servers, and applications. That easily gets made into graphs. That's only just a fraction of the elements and terms that surround Graphite. If you dive into it, you'll find an excellent solution for opensource monitoring software."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

Different weapons sound different. Battles are often fought with heavy use of cover and at distances where clear view of the enemy is impossible. So if you know everyone on your side is using M16s and you hear somebody in the bushes ahead shooting an AK-47, you’re likely to just open fire on them sight-unseen. Also, fallen weapons may have been booby-trapped by whoever abandoned them. That said, there are historical instances of it happening, I know of ones as far back as the mediaeval period, and as recent as WWII, In the modern era it generally only happens during protracted operations behind enemy lines or other circumstances where resupply is significantly delayed. It’s very definitely a “last resort” option since the typical soldier doesn’t have as much training with weapons other than his own and you never know what shape somebody else’s weapon is going to be in. After all, something happened that ended up with them being dead, and for all you know it was a weapons malfunction."},{"prompt":"w do you deliver effective communication?","completion":"I guess there’s an upside to every downside, so perhaps starting with the good part of the bad news would be the best way."},{"prompt":"What is the most expensive meteorite ever found?","completion":"This is the most expensive one up for sale.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","completion":"Possibly. But natural gas is delivered via underground lines that tend to be very reliable. While electricity might be underground for a couple of hundred yards to your house, there’s a lot of miles of overhead transmission lines between your house and a generating plant, all of which is very vulnerable to all sorts of outside events. This doesn’t always work out… Natural gas supplies can be interrupted, and in some areas that’s a risk worth considering (especially in earthquake country)…. But if you don’t use natural gas, it means considerably higher cost and generally the pain of maintaining a tank of diesel fuel. Home standby generators running on natural gas are almost always the best value to deal with the most situations at the best price point."},{"prompt":"Was the space shuttle program good, or should NASA have chosen something else?","completion":"My opinion is that the Shuttle Program was an unmitigated disaster. The Shuttle was the most costly way to get material into space ever divised.It had more astronaut deaths per flight than any other rocket.Requiring manned flights even for simple satellite launches was pretty stupid.It was supposed to fly once per week - it struggled to fly once per month.It caused NASA to have to pay the Russians crazy inflated prices for sending astronauts and cargo to the ISS. Thereby handing free money to our biggest competitor in space.It limited the growth of the ISS from it’s planned goal of being able to assemble spacecraft in orbit - to a somewhat pointless station with just 3 US astronauts doing experiments in space.It’s successor - the SLS - shows signs of being even MORE expensive and even LESS productive. To be clear - this was NOT NASA’s fault. It was the US government. NASA’s plan (post-Apollo) was to build a 100+ person space station which would be able to build spacecraft in orbit to go to the Moon and Mars…a “Space Factory”. They would continue to use the hugely successful Saturn V for unmanned heavy-lift work - flying huge payloads to the Space Factory.They would design a SMALL re-usable “Space Taxi” to get a few humans to orbit and back as needed. A “lifting body” - something like the very successful (unmanned) military X-37B or the present day DreamChaser.There would be a “Space Tug” - which would remain in space indefinitely - and be able to move payloads around the spaceship factory - and take trips to Lunar orbit and back. So what happened? Congress cancelled the Saturn V - leaving no heavy lift option.So the small “lifting body” space plane now had to be able to do heavy-lift work.Then the space station was down-sized, first to 25 people - then to an international station with 25 people - and then down to 12 people…and it today it typically hosts 6 to 9 people.So the Space-Taxi now had to be an airplane - it had to carry people - and it had to haul cargo - but not much at a time.With no large rocket factory in orbit - no longer could NASA assemble rockets in space.So no more “Space Tug”…and therefore no more trips to the Moon.And the abandonment of the Mars program.Then the US Military wanted in on the action - they started to demand some REALLY ridiculous things of the shuttle - things like launching, deploying a payload into a very specific orbit - and then landing again WITHIN ONE ORBIT. The shuttle’s design was crippled by these kinds of requirements - most of which (including that one) were never even once actually used.The idea to be able to retrieve satellites from orbit, bring them back to Earth for repair and refueling was added - so heavy payloads had to be brought back to Earth. This feature was only rarely used - but it still added layers of pain to the design process. It turned out that the cost of launching a shuttle was so astronomical that it was just cheaper to build a new satellite and pay someone else to launch it.The Shuttle could not remain on orbit for more than about 2 weeks…which made it useless for another huge range of missions.It could only just barely get beyond low earth orbit - so it couldn’t go to the moon or do any geostationary missions as NASA had intended.It was supposed to be reusable - but the cost of re-using it was crazy. The SRB’s were re-used even though it would be cheaper to throw them away and build new ones - just to appease the politicians.The main engines could be reused - but only at most 7 times - and the cost of inspection and refurbishment was almost as high as building new ones…and if the “re-use” requirement had been removed from the design - they would have been much cheaper.The re-entry heat system was hideously expensive - very, very hard to re-use - and resulted in the death of 7 astronauts and came VERY close to killing 7 more. And on and on. The shuttle was the shining example of “Jack of all trades and master of none”. But again - to be 100% clear - these problems were NOT of NASA’s making - their original concept for “post-Apollo” was really very good. But they’re a government agency - and they have to do what they’re told…period. Apollo was only funded because of the Cold War - and once that was settled - the money for Space rapidly diminished. The death of the shuttle and the eventual decision to encourage private space launch companies has turned out to be the best decision ever. The SLS is another disaster - but we’ll get over it. The future lies with half a dozen promising startups (half of whom will likely succeed) - and with SpaceX - and maybe Blue Origin. Removing rocket design from the hands of politicians - and letting NASA concentrate on what it’s truly awesome at (landers, rovers, orbiters and manned spaceflight) is a VERY good thing. NASA shouldn’t be designing semi-trucks to bring cargo to the space center - and they shouldn’t be designing space-truck so haul it to orbit or to the moon either. Once commercial spaceflight takes off - the government MUST NOT attempt to compete with private industry - but instead foster it - make the US be the BEST at commercial spaceflight - earn more taxes from the business they bring in and count that as a success."},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"“All the best for your career.

The messes they made in seasons 5 and 6 by my estimation were already beyond fixing.

It is a Chinese meal of shareable small bites, mostly buns and dumplings. Dim sum is best for dining in, enjoyed in a restaurant while it’s still hot. To begin you should have a pot of piping hot Chinese tea, refillable hot water; cups of tea serve as palate cleanser. Start by ordering your favourites if you have any. Dim sum classics include steamed dim sum such as har gow, siu mai, tofu skin wrap roll (yuba in Japanese), rice rolls made from rice milk, and char siu bun. Since each dim sum item comes in two’s and or three's, these suggestions would be enough for one person. For fried/baked dim sum dishes, taro dumpling or stir fried radish cake might be interesting options to steamed items. Most dim sum fillings are made from a mix of seasoned meat: minced/ground pork, or chicken, shrimp, fish paste, and a bit of vegetable. Wrappers are made from wheat or rice flour, and tofu skin. Glutinous rice dim sum dishes are rather filling. The sticky rice dough is used to wrap fried dumpling or the typical lotus leaf wrap rice stuffed with a little meat and Chinese sausage. One of the nicest things about a dim sum meal is the dessert. You can eat it anytime during the meal. Translated literally, dim sum means “touch the heart,” a poetic reference to dim sum as a light meal of snacks, not a full course dinner (though you’ll likely fill up quickly if you order enough from the menu)."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between a newspaper and newsletter?","completion":"A newspaper covers general news not confined to one subject.

A: Credit to my brilliant wife, who originally came up with this idea… Our three kids used to fight bed time, doing anything and everything to stay up later. I worked long hours (independent consultant with a very demanding client) and by “bed time” we had pretty well had it… My wife came up with the brilliant idea that all three kids would go to bed at the same time every night, but they would be allowed to read in bed for a while before “lights out.” The older kids got a longer reading period than the youngest, so it was perceived as fair by all. At first, one of us would make the rounds at the various “lights out” times, making sure they turned off their reading lights and went to sleep. But pretty quickly, we began to “forget” to check on them, and they would avidly read in bed until they actually got sleepy on their own. For years, they thought they were “getting over” on us with their “extra reading time.” Ha! We were the ones getting over on them! Not only were we getting some shared peace and quiet at the end of the day, but the kids were developing a love for reading that persists to this day!

They see life as a wolf v sheep kind of thing, a power play. (Many of them watched abuse growing up and decided they’d rather be the wolf than the sheep) We don’t. We see hierarchies but take each person as they come. They absolutely and can never be the sheep. This is their driving motive. Since you are a close relationship, you represent opportunity and a point of concern for them. The opportunity is to rule over another human, for the good of the universe, of course. The concern, you have a 50/50 chance of becoming the wolf. So they must be the wolf, for the good of the universe of course, and keep you as a sheep. Problem is that wolves eat sheep for dinner, the unfortunate side effect of single handedly keeping the universe in balance. When you tell them how you feel, its about the same as a sheep going “baa, baa” to a wolf. There’s a lot of play, fun and power in this. Think of a cat with a trapped mouse. The good thing is you don’t have to be the captured mouse. Your own soul and path of life are not the business of a soul predator.

When I found it I was amazed. What could it be?? A sport ball?? A old monk worship sphere?? Or an alien egg?? Whatever it is it's weird. I've brought it to historians, local beach gurus, shrimp boat people and everyone has their different thoughts. Definitely one of the weirdest things I've found. Edit: people have been asking some questions about the ball so here's some answers. I first talked to the old Fort clinch historian. The all got their look and feel for the object and all said different things. The most brought up possible answer is a cannon ball. The problem with that is a cannon ball will have a seam set around it and is made from iron. This object has no seam line sadly and isn't made from iron. It's not metallic. The next possible answer is if it's a rock that's been man smoothed. Like the dragons blood jasper Rock or a sodalite ball. (Sodalite ball) The weight is right at 2 pounds and the diameter is 3 inches. I did the volume and all other calculations a little back i just have to find a paper work and once I do I'll post it. Next possible answer is bocce ball. Bocce is a fancy game that you play with round balls like the one I found the only problem to that is that this doesn't feel like one. I went out to the local bocce ball court and asked to compare the two and it didn't match up quite well in person. So about now I was stumped.

Is there a better (meaning cheaper but ergonomically excellent) chair to buy for my home office?","completion":"I bought an Aeron about 14 years ago.

I am now going to sell it as used, and buy a new one with a new 12-year warranty. Oddly enough, the 'pellicle', which I would have expected to be the component most vulnerable to wear, still looks brand new.

Dropshipping is a business model based on reselling goods by sending them directly to customers from suppliers (be it wholesalers or manufacturers). Sounds a bit confusing, but it’s simple. In the standard model, you have to buy all those goods beforehand and place them in a warehouse. Only then you can start selling them as a retailer. However, in dropshipping, you start selling without actually having any products in the warehouse. In fact, you don’t even have a warehouse because you don’t need it! You promote the goods online through a dropshipping website where you provide potential customers with all the necessary information. It includes product images, descriptions, prices, delivery time and methods, etc. When a customer places an order, you contact your supplier, buy the given product, and ask the partner to send the item to your client. So, there’s no risk of stocking up on goods that will eventually not sell. You only order products after somebody buys from you. And you don’t have to take care of the shipment.

Niche analysis [LINKED_TEXT: Choosing a proper niche] [URL: https://alidropship.com/how-to-find-a-niche-market-for-dropshipping-store/] is one of the most important steps to setting up an online store and start selling products online. When picking up a broad and popular niche, one usually has to face serious competition. In this situation, one has few chances to beat other online stores. On the other hand, a narrow niche will attract too few customers. Your best choice is to find the happy medium with enough customers and moderate competition. At the same time, even a potentially profitable niche doesn’t guarantee success unless it’s something you enjoy. You will have to run the store, promote it, and talk to customers a lot. So, it’s highly important to understand the target audience, to know the subject, and to enjoy what you’re doing. From this perspective, passion is the key to success. If you don’t have anything in mind, AliDropship’s team will help you identify the best options.

Professional web design Are you good at drawing, picking up and mixing colours? If not, then how about asking professionals for help? Web design is very important if you want to make a successful online store. You could compare a website to a brick-and-mortar store. When people visit a site, the first thing they see is the colors on the homepage, the logo, the background, etc. Just like when you enter a shop for the first time. Those who don’t like what they see are likely to leave right away. That’s why you want a professional design — and that’s exactly what you get when you order a custom online store! Technical matters Aside from all these artistic issues, you also have to deal with a number of purely technical matters when creating your own dropshipping website. AliDropship’s team will take care of such tasks as mail service setup, Google Analytics integration, currency set up, etc. First of all, we install PayPal and a number of the most popular payment gateways on your site such as 2Checkout, Stripe, PayU, and others depending on your country of residence and where you’re going to dropship goods to.

We need more rats like we need another hole in the head. So let it go."},{"prompt":"What does an IITian's resume look like?","completion":"All the best resumes in the world have some basic rules that one must follow. However, to stand out to employers, they should be unique in their own way. Here are certain basic points you can use as a reference while drafting the best IIT resume. 1. Categorisation A best IIT resume must have key qualifications and competencies categorised well into sections. Headlines may be like academic qualifications, scholastic achievements, internship and research projects, technical skills, work experience, extracurricular etc. Do not overload your resume by accommodating more information. Know that simple things gain more attention. So, format your resume accordingly. 2. Length of a resume It is okay if your resume is somewhat lengthy. Keeping things simple has nothing to do with having a 3-page resume. Just make sure that you do not describe a particular topic too much. If you have more experience working as an IITian or many essential skills that you cannot skip, then it is better to mention those points. The ideal number of pages of a resume should not exceed 2 pages but again, it varies from individual to individual. 3. Strategy to hide weak areas It is quite acceptable that you may have certain weak points in your resume. Disguising them is your task. You must present your resume in such a manner that only highlights your expertise and draws less attention to your weak spaces. Let's say, you have a poor GPA in a particular educational qualification, you can leave that part and instead display your activities, papers, awards etc. Alternatively, you can talk about your major GPA that may get the interviewer to overlook other minor GPAs. 4. Use some colours Using some colours like green or blue to get the headlines noticeable is one criterion of a good resume. This same rule also applies to IITians. Since there may be a lot of qualifications, achievements and awards, it becomes necessary to look out for ways that can grab attention. Using colours and different fonts will certainly make the resume appealing. However, do not use too many colours as you don't want to create a rainbow out of a resume. Other than white for the background, the secondary colour should be black and for emphasis, you can use blue or green. Also, use bold fonts where needed. Italics are also fine to break away from the monotonous font that is generally used. 5. Other interests You may choose to add to the \\"Other interests\\" section of your resume where you will be highlighting your hobbies or other recreational activities. Although it is a norm to include this section at the end of the resume, it is not the least that you can mention. This part helps connect with your recruiter on a personal level. Besides, your hobbies will be highly regarded if they coincide with promoting awareness and welfare like recycling items or working for animal rights etc. Apart from analytical traits, you can also show your creative abilities like painting, story writing etc through the \\"other interests\\" section. I hope this answer helps you in drafting the best resume as an IITian. Keep your fingers crossed as your interviewer might hire you based on the fact that your resume crafting skills are extraordinary."},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Which and in what way? Drew M. listed links to research sources which would seem to indicate in terms of some academic parameters, they’re pretty equivalent. Of course, not all public schools are created equal, nor are privates; on Quora alone you’ll find harrowing anecdotal tales of both that may leave you afraid to send your kid to one of those…and other tales portrayed either as the clearly superior choice. I think the classic comparison people have in mind is this scenario: 1.) A good private school with high average ACT/SAT scores, accessible to middle class families willing to sacrifice (not a high end upper class school). 2.) A mediocre or lackluster public school (not an impoverished inner city nightmare or in a very affluent suburban neighborhood). 3.) Your kid has an I.Q. somewhere in the 110 - 130 range, has the potential to attend a decent state college productively, and you’d like the kid to at least get a bachelor degree (or at a dead minimum graduate high school and be fluent at reading). Many families asking this question view schools as college-prep., I think. In light of Drew M.’s links, is the family sending their kid to the private school wasting 6 grand (or whatever) per year for nothing? Consider this 5–7–22 article in The Atlantic: [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjjgPzImfb3AhXDLH0KHTmEAXQQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2022%2F05%2Fparenting-decisions-dont-trust-your-gut-book-excerpt%2F629734%2F&usg=AOvVaw0NPugSXOgnZgLUZYqn0fSchttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjjgPzImfb3AhXDLH0KHTmEAXQQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2022%2F05%2Fparenting-decisions-dont-trust-your-gut-book-excerpt%2F629734%2F&usg=AOvVaw0NPugSXOgnZgLUZYqn0fSc] [URL: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjjgPzImfb3AhXDLH0KHTmEAXQQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2022%2F05%2Fparenting-decisions-dont-trust-your-gut-book-excerpt%2F629734%2F&usg=AOvVaw0NPugSXOgnZgLUZYqn0fSc]After making the case for how much greater genetic endowment influences kids’ long-term prospects, nature over nurture (assuming an adequate, healthy home environment I imagine) - “The effects of nature on a child’s future income were some 2.5 times larger than the effects of nurture,” the author then tackles the question of an old Bob Dole vs. Hillary Clinton argument - what does it take to raise a child, a family or a village? It’s noted one decision may be very important. In a nutshell, researchers found out neighborhood matters! Some are much more advantageous than others. It notes a home’s location accounts for a significant fraction of the total effect of that home, gave an estimate that 25% (maybe more) of the overall effects of a parent are drive by where he/she raises their child, and 3 big predictors for a neighborhood to increase a child’s success are % households with 2 parents, % residents who are college grad.s, and % of residents who return census forms. “[LINKED_TEXT: A different study] [URL: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24062/w24062.pdf] that Chetty co-authored found that girls who move to areas with lots of female patent holders in a specific field are far more likely to grow up to earn patents in that same field. And [LINKED_TEXT: another study] [URL: https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/2/711/5687353] found that Black boys who grow up on blocks with many Black fathers around, even if that doesn’t include their own father, end up with much better life outcomes.” If we assume that a private school student body has fewer undesirables (e.g.: disruptive students, high maintenance special needs students who detract from others’ learning, gangs) and other distractions, kids and families who more strongly value formal education and likely have higher ambitions (e.g.: get a bachelor degree or higher, not just learn to read and ‘stay in school’ to get a diploma), and fewer harmful influences (e.g.: overt drug presence, gangs), to what extent is that a benefit? How many tragic stories of wasted lives start with ‘He/she fell in with a bad (or the wrong) crowd and…’ So a specific private school may be much better than a specific public school for a particular kid. I’ve yet to see a school named ‘Average High.’ If your local public school is quite good, and you don’t value religious incorporation in the school environment (or at least won’t pay much for it), you may not see much added value. If the public school(s) you have access to is mediocre or worse, check out the private options! Note: There are a range of special interest counter arguments. Family/student have religious differences with a religious school, LGBT student with a religious school deeming their lifestyle sinful, people who put a lot of value on more extensive sports offerings, etc…"},{"prompt":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","completion":"In my humble opinion, all nutritious food can be eaten in a rational, comfortable and sufficiently advanced way ie ‘civilised manner’.

Official who called said that General Compartment is 2S and hence your reservation is now in General compartment. And you can book the reservation ( read no reservation) in the general compartment through IRCTC for standing in the compartment filled with unlimited people. 8. You will not find any TTE in the general compartment but they will ask you to complain to TTE to get your reserved seat.

No conservatives are interested in bailing out corporations, and in almost every case when it happens it is liberals who push it and benefit from it. The majority of big pharma, banks, and most other companies who have received federal bailouts have been heavy Democratic donors. You might find some RINOs that support corporate bailouts, they are not conservatives. Bailouts for anyone is not a conservative concept, not for big businesses, not for freeloading students. And keep in mind, most of the people who are eligible for the student loan benefits are white, upper middle-class democrats. Do your homework, Most poor minorities never make it to colleges and those who do dominate local and 2-year colleges. Those who rise past that to better universities are often there with heavy subsidies. Just like most lies from the left, almost everything they do in the name of the poor and minorities never is, they are always the ones hurt most by Democrats whom they continue to support and elect."},{"prompt":"My therapist told me that I have to form a healthy relationship with myself before I can love others in a healthy manner?

Thick plastic also costs money. As does metal and making such into the right shapes. A ‘gaming grade’ object is often, but not always, a bit tougher than an office grade object, as such are at times expected to see heavy use by someone with a lot of adrenaline flowing. A keyboard is, at a basic level, just a housing for a bunch of switches. It can have lights or not. The housing, quality of switches and how durable the entire bit is, is a direct relationship value to how much it costs to make it, to a point. That point is somewhere around 100 typically for a good long lasting board. By long lasting, well. 8 hours a day, every day for multiple years. Coder and writer boards are about the same, or even more expensive. This isn’t for occasional use, this is a constantly in use every day object often seeing more attention than ones shoes. Which also run about that much for a good pair which is able to sustain use for more than a short time period of intensity. Expensive is relative. What’s being comfortable worth? What’s not having to relearn a new keyboard or get a new one as the old one breaks, worth? How much one uses ones tools, often determines how much one is willing to pay out for such. And gamers have it easy compared to mechanics in that regard. ^_^"},{"prompt":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","completion":"After years of hard work, writing up a PhD can frequently occur in a flurry of activity in the final few months of your degree studies.

Local and foreign financial institutions own 22 trillion dollars in the form of treasury bonds and similar securities that are liquid assets and can be turned back into cash by selling the bonds in the secondary markets or redeemed for cash plus interest by the FED/Treasury upon maturity of the bond. Who does the US government have to repay when others already own these assets? US government deficits have been financed through currency issuance by the FED at no effective cost or interest expense. There is no US government debt but the states certainly do have debts. It has been this way since 1971 when Richard Nixon unpegged the US dollar from gold and it became a free floating fiat currency. The fact that treasury bonds are sold on a one to one basis corresponding to any federal deficits gives the illusion that bonds fund deficits but this has not been the case since 1971. Bond sales are actually used to remove excess reserves from the US banking system so as to maintain the target interest rate during overnight interbank lending but even here better alternatives exist for example maintaining a policy of a zero interest rate on bank reserves. Bond sales are currently part of monetary policy (interest rate control) and not fiscal policy as the sale of bonds in no way increases the spending capacity of the federal government. The fear campaigns about US government deficits and the federal debt are based on falsehoods and are used by corporate and commercial banking interests to convince politicians and citizens that government austerity must be imposed and to maintain a large pool of unemployed to help drive down labour costs. The reality is that optimal fiscal policy occurs when deficits are sufficient that the private and government sectors are able to deliver full employment. Deficits are nearly always necessary to achieve full employment but if ongoing inflation was trending above a target rate of 2% for example and shrinking the deficit was not sufficient to reduce inflation then a federal government surplus may then be necessary.

Circular accelerators are useful in that you can re-use the circular track to build up proton velocities over a much longer distance than a single straight track. In order to use a circular accelerator in this way, you need to have magnets exerting a magnetic field on the accelerator ring. Charged particles bend when moving through a magnetic field (the Lorentz Force), and equating the Lorentz force to the centripetal force on an object moving in a circular path will give you the numbers and variable relationships necessary to produce a stable orbit: F = qvB = mv^2 / r There is no fundamental radius that an accelerator must have in order to be successful, but the choice of radius does affect how strong your magnets must be. Stronger and stronger magnets are required to constrain higher and higher velocity particles to the same radius. The choice of circular accelerator radius then becomes an engineering problem - is it easier to create more powerful magnets along the whole ring, or is it easier to build a larger ring? Building a whole new accelerator from scratch is very time- and labour-intensive, and a big commitment for any scientific collaboration. Once an accelerator is built it typically undergoes many magnet, geometry, and detector upgrades over a long time period to create as much value as possible from its initial investment."},{"prompt":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","completion":"Great A2A. Well let\`s just be real.. for starters.. this photo will live on forever. Damn. That is some humiliating shit. So to break it down real quick for you and everyone else, this is why Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars last year. Will hit Chris because he was going through alot in his life at that point. The constant humiliation he has endured from his wife Jada [LINKED_TEXT: Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith confirm her relationship with August Alsina on 'Red Table Talk'The actress said she began a relationship with Alsina while separated from her husband Will Smith, who joined her for Friday's episode of the show.https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smith-confirm-her-entanglement-singer-august-n1233580] [URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smith-confirm-her-entanglement-singer-august-n1233580]( Trash TV at it\`s finest ladies and gentleman ) The times he felt he was a coward as a kid from when he saw his mother get beat by his father and did not do anything to help, not to mention how he felt he could never match up to Tupac, [LINKED_TEXT: Will Smith says the way Jada Pinkett Smith 'loved' Tupac 'rendered me incapable of being friends with him'In his new memoir released on Tuesday, Smith said that the late rapper was \\"fearless\\" and triggered his own perception of himself as a \\"coward.\\"https://www.insider.com/will-smith-memoir-incapable-befriending-tupac-jada-pinkett-smith-love-2021-11] [URL: https://www.insider.com/will-smith-memoir-incapable-befriending-tupac-jada-pinkett-smith-love-2021-11]plus all the constant humiliation with jokes/ memes he endured over the prior two years, all of his emotions just came out in a silly ass stupid way. Not only did it show that he goes for easy targets since he picked out Chris because Chris has always said he is not a fighter. Because think about it, he damn sure did not slap 50 Cent for all the crap he was popping. Another thing is that it just showed me that I just seen an icon in pop culture have a breakdown like the rest of us. It does not excuse what Will did. Like Chris said “ That was some bitch ass shit. “ But I understand. He was just tired of the crap and went at someone he knew he could pick on. Plain and simple. I will still be a fan of Will. I think he is a good guy. Just made a horrible mistake. And he is paying the price for it. I think he should take a long look at who he is married too. Because even though I don\`t need to speculate on other\`s personal affairs, you can see Jada is toxic and is the one pulling Will Smith\`s strings. But he is a grown man. He has to do what is right for him. I know what I would do. Leave. Lol. Take this as a wise life lesson fellas: Don\`t ever fight for anyone that does not respect you. Real talk. Yes stick up for your women when she is loyal, kind, strong, and has your back. Those are the women you fight for. Not a person that disrespects you at every chance they get. Why show them respect when they don\`t bother doing the same to you? Exactly. Plus think about this: How do you slap a man for a joke you laughed at? Yeah. Bitch ass shit. And to close out on Chris… Chris.. you are a solid good man. Takes alot of strength to handle that. It does. But… You gotta learn to stand up for yourself my man. I went through this shit too. I\`m no tough guy by any stretch, but until I started fighting back and sticking up for myself more in life, I saw exactly why people did not show me respect. You are not desirable to even be around when you carry yourself that weak. You can not expect women to want to date you and look at you as a “ strong man “ when you are letting another cat bitch slap you in public. You lose respect from people instantly. It not only hurts you. It hurts your love ones, your kids lose respect for you, and all the hard work you have done in your life for 30 plus years is now just remembered as “ the guy that took a slap from Will Smith “ So believe me, even though Will has gone through alot of backlash, Chris is the one that still got hit and embarrassed. Think about it. It\`s been a year since that happened. And it is still shown alot. You can even see his own peers laughing at it. Damn that has to sting. Especially when you are supposed friends with these people. I know how comedians are. They are going to joke. But do you want to be the punchline to every joke? I don\`t think so. And another thing: It will never go away. Chris will always have to live with that humiliation forever. Might sound harsh but it will be hard to get jobs as a actor like he did in “ Fargo “ playing a gangster. How can you play a gangster when everyone see\`s you get treated like that? You will not be able to sell that illusion. And dating? Shit… woman can be brutal. You think a women would not pop their mouth if Chris raised his voice at them after seeing that? Probably say some shit about getting Will to slap him again. Cruel world. But that is how it is. Hopefully Chris does what I did. Destroy all that weak shit inside you. Find that inner strength you always had. And rebuild yourself from the ground up. Takes time. But its possible. And I have faith in Chris. I\`m rooting for him hard. I hate bullies. I really do. Went through that myself. So I always root for the underdog. So I was happy to see Chris get some payback in “ Selective Outrage “ Nice start to redeem himself. ( Was too nice but it is start ) In closing, that is why this incident happened. Will saw a chance to hit someone that would not fight back. And Chris was that person. So Will obviously needs to learn how to control himself better and not be manipulative. Stop picking easy targets as well to lash out at. And Chris has to learn to stand up for himself. Plain and simple. Safe to say this.. this will be a incident that is in pop culture now. I know Chris got 20 million for “ Selective Outrage “ But was the money worth going through this Chris? I don\`t think so. So not only does Will have some inner soul searching to do, Chris does as well too. And that is real shit. Thanks for reading. Take care. Peace. O.J.

Honestly, it feels great to be on the other side of the question. Well, you asked for “the best advice”. Ideally, I should stick to a single piece of advice. So, I shortlisted some of the things I wanted to say to my younger self if it’d have been possible and ranked them in order of my importance. But I ended up with two in the first position, and I cannot distinguish which one will be the best. Now, I won’t talk about revising notes regularly, putting consistent effort, etc. I believe if you are a JEE aspirant, you already know these. I think the question you should be asking (or have asked) is, “Why should I put so much effort, so many sacrifices for two long years to get into IIT? Is it worth it?” That brings me to my first piece of advice. Why IIT? What is the point of all this? The usual perception about IIT is that you will earn a lot when you graduate from there. You probably would have heard it from literally everybody. Sure, it gives you a headstart in your career, but it is much more than that. I think the most important thing IIT provides is the exposure to different disciplines. It offers you an opportunity to explore and find your interest. The professors you get to interact with, most of them are exemplary. Some of the connections you will make there will be life-long and helpful throughout your career. IIT gives you credibility. Wherever and whatever you say will be taken seriously by default. Add to that an amazing set of talented students and a competitive environment. Every student there is talented in some aspect or the other. IIT will never stop you from doing something. It will always help and support you (with scope and infrastructure) in whatever field (any hobbies, academic streams, etc.) you want to grow into. Now, what if you don’t get into IIT. After all only around 15000 students get to study out of more than 11 Lakh candidates. Is it difficult? YES What if you do not get into IIT? Nothing changes. An exam does not define how good you are. Always keep that in mind. The preparation you took for the past 2 years have developed your problem solving capabilities to a great extent. It has already developed your thought process. The preparation has already changed you in some aspects and you will realise this probably some years later. Lastly, do not give too much importance to the exam. Your life does not depend on it.

I was 12 at the time and am now 13. I have been watching PG-13 movies since I was 10, and since I was almost 13, my parents agreed to let me watch an R movie. I didn’t want there to be nudity or too much swearing or gore. There was a heck of a lot of swearing and some violence that I could handle, but luckily no nudity or sexual content. As long as there is no nudity and your kid is okay hearing a few f words or anything like that, I believe 12 or 13 is a good age to start watching R movies."},{"prompt":"Who is your favourite Egyptian pharaoh, and why?","completion":"i think Akhenaten ,who was also the founder of Atenism and was the first known monotheist."},{"prompt":"Who represents the GOP in 2021?","completion":"The House Minority Leader, and the Senate Minority Leader…pretty pitiful ain’t it."},{"prompt":"there any prayer which God hasn’t answered?","completion":"No one can explain such matters except by reference to scripture and personal experience. Regarding the latter I can say that God works in mysterious ways and He is not like an Amazon ordering system. He often answers our prayers by changing us so that we can change things that we seek to change. Also divine interventions are sometimes subtle and unexpected. Also God is more interested in our long term spiritual journey and how we reach our ultimate destination than day to day problems. Along the way we will experience obstacles and troubles which is in the nature of following Christ. Jesus experienced many difficulties including betrayal, torture and death. God like a loving father knows what’s best for His children. Tough love often means denying a child’s request because it may be considered inappropriate or dangerous to the child’s healthy and safe development. As Christians we should be motivated by spiritual welfare and development rather than material welfare. At times we are also tested to strengthen our faith."},{"prompt":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","completion":"One occasion my dog, my mate and I were out front of the house and my dog Jack squatted to have a pee, my mate says ‘you piss like a girl Jack’ (a phrase he’d NOT heard before), well, my mate got the filthiest of looks as a response and the next time my mate visited, Jack refused to acknowledge him and actually turned his head away when greeted, but as soon as my mate gave up and walked off, Jack leapt up and grabbed him around the calf almost face-planting my mate, Jack acted as though it was hilarious and I assumed it was payback for the offensive piss comment as that resulting action was a ‘one of’ event. Another dog, Tom, would be told when i was leaving home, I’ll be an hour or I’ll be twenty minutes or whatever, upon my return I would say, see I told you I’d be twenty or yes i know I said an hour but I took two and on those occasions I was longer than I stated my comments were because I trying o appease the offended look my dog was giving me, if I did not address my lateness he would be definitely be showing signs of being ‘affronted’."},{"prompt":"plan to represent myself in court and consider myself extremely versatile so I should be able to win it.

They reach the main area and shot all the guards on their way, utter chaos for the customers and bank staff, the gangsters made it to the vault in no time. The Vault was secured by an advanced security system, but the gangsters were fully prepared, with their gadgets and armaments, they opened the vault in a little time. The leader rejoiced and ordered a guy to enter the vault. The first guy entered the vault and Boom- disappeared for a few seconds, and then appeared unconscious. Second and Third guy entered- disappeared by a shadow, ended up like the first guy. The group leader thundered and ordered everyone to shoot the vigilante, everyone entered the vault firing on a shadow, which was moving carefully while deflecting the bullets fired on him with a bat-like weapon. Something like this: The Bank staff informed the police department about the heist and asked for immediate assistance. Meanwhile into the vault, the vigilante was doing his job with commitment, he was very patient in his application, and was perfectly handling the weapon(bat). The leader of the group lost all his men one by one in front of his eyes, he stood there in shock and disbelief, his weapons and talented men were all gone, his self-respect was shattered, his body was shivering, all of this was because of this one Guy, this vigilante, the one who defended the attack and stood like a wall between his men and Victory. The one who just disappeared in the vents. The Police teams were really quick to reach the bank and minutes later the leader of the gang was arrested by Police, surrounded by his fallen men and their tools of destruction, he was lost and dumbstruck by the turn of events he just had witnessed. Later during the police investigation, he(leader) said: “ We failed as a team, because of the Wall”. “The Wall” mumbled the little boy Rahul, who was curiously watching all of this on national news. “One day I’ll be Wall too” the little boy muttered to himself, he was holding a bat in one hand and a helmet(in place of the mask) in another, just like the hero of the bank.

For Apple it is against their business plan. Let me explain this simply. Touch screens made by Apple are pretty cool. I don’t think there are many companies that can match up to this quality there is no denying. If you think Apple not only makes laptops but also phones and tablets. Suddenly if they added touch screesn their tablats would be considered useless. Why? Because a consumer is very simple minded. He/She will simply see that it is pointless to own an iPad since they could invest in a laptop which in today’s modern society is necessarry and have an iPad and more functions in just one thing. So Apple would never be able to think an excuse to sell their iPads. If they did implement touch screens on their laptops it would mean the death for their tablets but off course it would be very dope to have touch screen macbooks or iMacs."},{"prompt":"Why do gamers buy expensive keyboards?","completion":"for better gaming and controlling"},{"prompt":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?","completion":"If your manager has asked you for a resignation letter, it means that they are requesting that you voluntarily resign from your position rather than being terminated or fired. Essentially, they are asking you to submit a letter stating that you are resigning from your position, which would make it appear as though you resigned voluntarily rather than being fired. However, the decision to resign or be terminated ultimately depends on the circumstances surrounding your departure from the company. If your manager has communicated that they are not able to keep your position anymore and has asked you for a resignation letter, it's possible that this is a result of changes within the company or a need to reduce staff. In this case, it may be a mutual decision for you to resign. Alternatively, if your manager is forcing you to resign because of performance issues or misconduct, this could be considered a termination. If you have concerns about the situation, it may be a good idea to consult with a legal professional or your company's human resources department for guidance."},{"prompt":"What do you think should happen to people whose ancestors owned slaves in the southern part of the United States?","completion":"Nothing bad.

This question is ridiculous."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"How To Be Recession Proof In The Current State Of The Economy The current state of the economy may have a lot to do with what happened with Covid 2 years ago. But I think that Covid just speeded everything up to what was going to happen anyway. Interest Rates With interest rates planning to go sky high, the fuel prices all over the world already have. We are all just waiting for someone on the tv to say “we are in a recession” when we probably have been for 6 months. I think the world leaders are hesitant to actually say we are in a recession because many people panic. I mean everyone stocked up on toilet roll because they saw it on tv. This is why so many people have taken to building something online. Its digital – The government can make you stay at home, who cares They cant close your business down or stop you creating content to upload. Your customers are all over the world – its like having a 24 hour 7 day a week world wide shop. That’s 100% recession proof. When all business were forced to close – they turned to the internet to keep their business running. The problem was that offline business owners didn’t have a clue how to market themselves on the world wide web. How to target their perfect audience. Facebook made millions from people just creating ads and targeting every one in the world, which is pointless for a pizza delivery restaurant in a small town. So this forced company’s to out source the online work. To people online who would do the work for them, for a small commission. Some business have thrived since the pandemic due to moving online. Others have wasted money and gone under. Then people have started to realize the potential of working online from home – Some didn’t even go back to the job they had, even if they could. The skills you learn marketing online can be adapted to any business all over the world, its all connected to the internet. Things Will Only Get Worse With The Economy I see so many people struggling and trying to keep up with the bills coming in, even trying to ignore the fact of the cost of living going up, but the wages staying the same. Then banging it all on a credit card. I know people who work REALLY hard in their job because they want to keep it, only to find out one day – its gone. The whole business has been losing money and that means every single employee is also out of a job! This is why I think its vital to have a plan B, even if it’s an hour a day. You learn something new, look into another opportunity – don’t keep all you eggs in one basket. This will take the pressure off of you being so desperate to keep that one job, hope and preying that nothing happens and your unemployed. Who knows that plan B can become the Plan A one day. You can still continue to work for someone else in a job – but you wont be so worried that its not going to be there tomorrow. People have been building a business online for years, they have made the mistakes, they have spent 10 years testing things out and learning what works. Just like your supervisor at work. You learn the skills from them. That’s just what I did, I’m a 40 year old guy. The internet is for watching films and buying things I don’t need from eBay. I needed to learn from someone else. I needed to see just how they managed to build a business online and continue to thrive, even through the pandemic. That’s why I grabbed a copy of this book. Less than a chrome sky hood from eBay for 7! [LINKED_TEXT: Grab A Copy Here] [URL: https://rn132.isrefer.com/go/tieoffer/a6789/] I started to learn and haven’t stopped to this day. The recession is coming or is it already here? Its all I hear in the financial space, look into a Plan B and check out the book"},{"prompt":"What are some recommended laptops for college?","completion":"I’ve answered similar questions to this before but i’ll reiterate here… It depends on what you need that laptop to do and also depends on your budget. Over the years I’ve gotten very good at getting what i need out of my PC’s on a budget. School saps a lot of money out of you so students don’t always have access to unlimited funds to buy a PC. So for the first question: What do you need this laptop to do? Think about your major, if you’ve declared one. Are you studying computer science or engineering? Are you an art student that may need some grunt for 3d rendering or working with hundreds of layers on digital artwork? Are you learning to be a game designer or rendering animated movies? These example use cases are some of the areas where i would say, go big. Get something with enough grunt to do the work you need it to. I had to upgrade my Dell Latitude i picked up when i started my Masters program earlier this year to a newer model Dell Precision because of the VM work i’m doing in my cyber security courses as part of my Masters degree. If you’re degree is art focused then maybe something with a discrete GPU would be useful as well. You likely wouldn’t need a gaming class GPU for a discrete but even something like an Nvidia mx350 would be a big boost over Intel’s integrated GPU. Also if you can find them, models that come with Ryzen processors often have much better than average performance when compared to other model integrated GPUs. So figuring out what you need for specs is important. Now if you’re a psychology major or an English major or something where you’ll be writing word docs and making power points but not much else other than emailing and internet research and whatnot, then you have a lot more flexibility and can go with something that costs a bit less. I’d still make sure you had something like an i3 processor or an i5 (as opposed to a Celeron or something in the ultra bdget range) and 8GB of RAM or better as a base line, so that for the basic tasks it runs consistently but you can get away with near the bottom of those specs to save some cash if you’re on a budget. So here’s what i would recommend for specs: General Tasks (ie. email, internet, watching videos, writing papers, designing power points, etc)Minimum: Intel i3 or Ryzen 3 processor, 8GB RAM or better, and a 250GB SSDRecommended: Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB of RAM or better, and maybe a large SSD if you think you’ll need more space Artwork focused (ie. for rendering 3d graphics, game design, huge digital art projects with a lot of layers, etc)Minimum: Intel i5 processor or Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB RAM or better, 500GB SSD (these types of files can be large so more storage is important)Recommended: Intel i7 processor or Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM or better, 500GB SSD or better and depending on how heavy the art you want to work with is, a discrete GPU of some kind What i’m using as an adult student studying for his Masters in Information Technology:Started with a Dell Latitude with an i5 processor and 16GB of RAM with a 1TB SSD and an integrated GPU (got it for about 300). This was solid for my first semester which was a project management course which was all power point and MS Project, but when i started my Digital Forensic Analysis class and i had to be running multiple VM’s on that system, I needed an upgrade. So i sold it and bought this…Now using a Dell Precision 5530 with an 8th gen Intel 7, 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It also has a hyrbid discrete GPU setup with both an Intel GPU for the day to day (to conserve battery) and then an Nvidia Quadro P1000 discrete graphics card. Now i had the money in this case so i went a little over the top. I likely could have found another latitude with an i7 and more RAM and saved a little money but I really do love this machine. It flies and i got it refurbished for about 600, where new it would have been somewhere around 1500. The i7 latitude would have run me in the 400-600 range depending on how old the refurbished model i was looking at was. Question 2: how to shop for a solid school PC on a budget? Refurbished PC’s are a really good way to go if you’re on a budget. You can spend what it would cost to get something like a cheapy HP stream but end up with a couple year old business class laptop that’ll, bury that Stream in specs, last you for a long time and are, in many cases, upgradable and much easier to service if anything does break while you have it. Some shops even charge less to service business models because they are designed to be easier to work on then consumer machines. I do recommend that you stay away from consumer models when shopping for refurbs. Examples of this would be like: HP Pavilions, Dell Inspirons, Lenovo Ideapads, or pretty much anything that comes off the shelf at a Best Buy. Instead, find refurbished Dell Latitudes and Precisions, Lenovo ThinkPads, or HP Elitebooks or Probooks on Amazon or eBay. Many companies buy huge amounts of these model machines and then upgrade the hardware 2–4 years later and put these machines out to refurb companies to sell on places like eBay and Amazon. Now when you’re shopping for these, make sure you are looking at a manufacturer certified refurb company, or a Microsoft certified refurb company. They’ll have it indicated on their store pages on eBay and Amazon as well as other sellers like Newegg. Check how many happy customer reviews they have because some refurb shops are sloppy. I always look for certified ones with over a 95% positive feedback rating and they have to have a lot of reviews. Since following these rules for myself, i’ve never had a problem buying refurbished computers. Below are some models i would recommend for general use and 1 or 2 for the more high powered needs. I hope this is helpful. Good luck shopping and in school.

You have an entire agency who’s only purpose is to know -WHO- has -WHAT- physical copy of a classified document -WHERE- that maintains the following chain of custody log, that states who has exactly which copies (they are numbered) and where container security log, that lists exactly which classified documents are inside (the ones not out on a custody log) and sealed with a two signature tamper proof security seal facilities audit log that is two person signed that is checked 3 times a shift to verify that no seals are broken or tampered with copy audit log that tracks exactly how many copies are made (It has a physical counter that can’t be reset) that also logs where each copy is assigned (custody or container log) And folks want me to believe that 15 BOXES existed that NO ONE had any idea what they were or who had them, and went unnoticed for MONTHS with a 3 time a shift security audit being performed… If the files were that OH MUH GERD critical and vital security then why did they not use the logs, find who had them, and retrieve them -MONTHS- ago? If the files were -NOT- that critical and vital to security, then why the sudden ‘accidental leak’ to the media to get outrage about them? If they want to claim that they -WERE- that vital, but haven’t known for months, then why have we not heard about the massive agency purge and convictions of those who were supposed to be maintaining the logs, and performing the security audits for -MONTHS- but were not? So if he was not legally supposed to have them, they would have been noted as being missing, logs shown exactly what documents they were, and retrieved -months- ago, then the obvious elephant in the room logic is that he had them legitimately, provided by the GSA, and they knew exactly what he had."},{"prompt":"the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?","completion":"Birth certificates and Social Security cards are issued, by law, shortly after birth.

My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.","completion":"Vaccines absolutely do NOT cause autism. Chemicals that got into the mother’s bloodstream, which then got into the fetus’s bloodstream, are the most likely culprit in my opinion. It takes years for brain differences like autism or ADHD or other learning differences to develop. Why are so many cases of autism detected soon after so many vaccines are administered? Before age three, it is not possible for most psychiatrists and other experts to detect the behavioral signs that indicate that a child might be autistic. I have Asperger’s, a form of autism, but I was not diagnosed until I was in my 40’s. Having been born in 1951, doctors did not recognize mental differences like ADHD, Asperger’s, autism, etc. I wonder if chemicals in the environment where she worked in the years before I was born were the cause. She worked for my grandfather, her father, a Lathing Contractor, and I’d imagine that their warehouse and office space often smelled of chemicals that were used in that industry. If you read more about the [LINKED_TEXT: lathing] [URL: https://www.bobvila.com/articles/lath-and-plaster/#%3A~%3Atext%3DDense%20lath%20and%20plaster%20provides%2C%2C%20fire%20resistance%2C%20and%20soundproofing.%26text%3DLath%20and%20plaster%20walls%20provide%2Cone%20room%20to%20the%20next.], you’ll see that chemicals could easily be a part of the problem. I sometimes wonder: Did some types of lathing have asbestos as an ingredient? If my mother was not protected against airborne asbestos in Grandpa’s offices, did the air she breathed contribute to my autism?Did the lead paint (popular in the 1940’s) painted onto the lath surfaces enter her environment? If lead flaked off the walls, could that ingredient have gotten into the food she ate, and stay in her bloodstream long enough to affect my tiny fetal brain when the percentage amount of lead or asbestos or other poison in the fetal bloodstream was much higher than the percentage amount of poisons in my mother’s brain? Of course, parents do not want to blame environmental poisons during pregnancy because that means that some parents will feel guilty, so instead, they blame doctors. Think about it. The amount of chemical in a vaccine is very tiny compared to the size of a three year old child’s brain, but the amount of poison in a mother’s bloodstream, entering a developing fetal brain, is much larger as a proportion. I am very happy that my mother made sure that I got all my vaccines. I did not get polio like one of my friends who was born a few years before I was (who I did not meet until we were both in our 40s). I did not develop any major illnesses for which I was protected.

The Big Bang theory, in spite of the name, makes no such claim. Fourth, and final problem: it has the same shortcoming as my new theory, the Big Beachball Theory: It’s unfalsifiable. It can’t be proven wrong, since we have no way of knowing what there was before a certain point in time, and there is no way we can ever know.

When my husband comes back from work, I welcome him with dinner, and I go and lay down. Since he had stayed at home with the kids several times before, he does understand how difficult and tiresome the job is.

So, he takes care of our children when he comes back home. At night, he gives them a bath while I wash the dishes and tide up. It’s all a team effort and we are both happy. Whenever one of us needs a break, the other one takes care of everything. My advice to all of you who don’t get any help is: Ask for it. You and your husband are both capable of sharing house chores, to give each other a break, and to help around. You need to take a moment for yourself, it is almost a requirement to have a “me-time” in order to be emotionally, physically, and mentally fit. We all do: we all get tired and we all need help.

So we went to this Multiplex called ‘Movietime’ located in Chembur, Mumbai. That Multiplex had around 4–5 screens and was around 5 storeys tall. When we got into our respective screen the experience was just marvelous with a huge curved screen and to add to the natural environment of Wakanda it had Dolby Atmos which gave amazing experience (normally in multiplexes you mostly get Dolby Surround). The experience of watching a movie with Atmos was just serene but only did we know that what did we have in store post interval… Everything was going right when we ended up with this… Everything went blank… they also stopped the AC in the hall which made it quite suffocating for all of us… people were furious over the staff and officials as after all this was completely unprofessional from their side running a huge multiplex. They spoiled the link of the movie as when they tried to resume watching the projector would itself shut down. Regardless to say, our 3:00 PM show ran till 6:30 PM (-_-). If anyone's planning to watch a movie there then please think twice before you go… We further went on to hear it from many mutual friends that it was a common issue with 3D movies in their cinema halls.

Two years later, he published the Code of Methodology of the Social Sciences and introduced the major social science discipline in Europe.

Even why you’re speeding. I got pulled over by a Louisiana State Trooper once for 110 in a 60, around midnight. He’d been tailing me (pacing my speed) for about three miles. From the driver’s seat, all I saw was a car staying inches off my bumper for miles and matching my lane changes-a red flag to most. After a while, I decided to speed up and see what he did, figuring maybe he’s following me. I was already cruising along at 75(the roads were mostly empty). I hit the gas to Pass a line of cars then take the exit last second after passing them if he was following for some reason. Sure enough, when I dropped the hammer, so did he! Complete with lights and sirens-oops. Well, he gets to the window and asks if I knew why he pulled me over, and I tell him I fucked up a smidge-didn’t realize it was a cop behind me and thought someone was following me for some reason, dangerously close to my bumper and wanted to get them off my bumper, as, being so dark, it didn’t look like a cop car since I couldn’t see his light bar. He told me he had been pacing me for three miles and had me at 75mph-fifteen over but the roads were pretty clear and I hadn’t seemed to be driving dangerously so he wasn’t going to pull me over-until I dropped the hammer and broke 100mph. But, for all that, he seemed to be in a good mood-or just not feel like doing paperwork-and I guess my story was understandable, being 18 probably didn’t hurt either-who doesn’t do stupid shit at that age? Because he cut me loose with a verbal warning, and told me to “keep it under 100”. My brother, on the other hand, was pulled over by a small town cop for 98 in a 45(clocked, but he went a bit faster than that and everybody knew it, in fact he hit the Governor-which would be 110mph). He was driving flat out, engine screaming, down some old country back roads, when he passed through the main drag, foot to the floor and never touched the brakes. He blew passed the one cop on duty, writing a ticket. As he gets down the road, he realizes he forgot his phone at our cousin’s place back the way he’d come so he turned around and passed through town, again, foot to the floor and blew passed the town’s cop AGAIN, And never even noticed him. The cop, having finished writing his ticket, couldn’t believe the audacity and gave chase to this crusty rapscallion, determined to put a stop to these antics. For my brother’s, part, he’s got the radio blaring some old rock ‘n’ roll, engine screaming, barreling through the turns just as fast as that old truck could bear, and that poor old cop just couldn’t keep up, losing my brother somewhere along the way, having never noticed the cop trying to pull him over since at those speeds, in those roads, he’s so intently focused on the road ahead. He gets to our cousin’s, grabs his phone and what does he do? Passes right through town yet again, full speed ahead, and again, without noticing, blows the door off our old friend, Who we now refer to as ole Roscoe P. Coltrain. From the passenger seat, I suggest we go visit our brother’s and uncle’s grave sites and leave some pot on our uncle’s gravestone for him, as is our old tradition, since it isn’t too far. So we get to the turn where we gotta cross some railroad tracks and he slows down for the crossing. As he does, the cop closes the distance and as he turns in, I catch sight of those old blues and twos turning in behind us. After a brief discussion, we figure he’s close enough that he’ll have the plates to run so we may as well pull over. Pulled over, just across the tracks and the cop gets to the window, and the first words out of mouth are “why did you run from me back there”? To a truck full of dumbfounded teenagers. “Wait, WHAT?!” Well, that old cop follows up, “ look, I’m about to get off and I would hate to have to stay late to fill out arrest paperwork, give me one good reason why I shouldn’t arrest you.” So, quick on my feet, I piped up, pointing out our speed and the narrow country roads, the fact that the radio was blasting and everybody was watching for any cars about to pull out ahead, so nobody would have been looking behind us. That seemed to satisfy him, somewhat, so he cut my brother a break and didn’t arrest him. But he did write him a ticket for 98 in a 45–53MPH over, and a little more than double the speed limit. It was a mandatory court appearance, and did I say this was a small town tree? I meant SMALL town, really really SMALL. He gets to the courthouse and meets with the judge, over a kitchen table and they work it out-judge asks him if he learned his lesson, and my brother replies “no, I’m gonna probably do it again because I’m young and dumb, but I won’t be doing it again here.” Perhaps not the best answer to the question, but it seemed to have earned him some respect in the eyes of this judge for honesty, at least. Judge gave him a break-still a painful one, but could have been a whole lot worse. Fine of 450, plus defensive driving school and, under a deferral program, provided he successfully completed the defensive driving school, the interaction wouldn’t be reported on his record. Judge let him make a payment plan on the fine, and get completed the defensive driving school so his insurance didn’t take a massive hike. now, that cop could have arrested him on the spot, and the judge could have sentenced him to jail or taken his license or imposed much larger fines. That’s just one outcome, much is left to the officer’s discretion on the streets, and judicial discretion in the courtroom."},{"prompt":"Who would win, Itachi Uchiha vs Tobirama Senju?","completion":"Let's consider both contestant in their prime stage. Tobirama senju, 2nd hokage, was one of the strongest shinobi at that time. He was considered as father of ninjutsu. He made many jutsus like shadow clone, water style, Edo tensie. He has vast amount of chakra reserves. Itachi on the other hand had fearsome mangekyo sharingan. He was considered as second strongest uchiha after madara. Since we took both in their prime Conditions, let's disregard the health issue of Itachi. Taijutsu With his sharingan, Itachi had plus point in close range combat as he can predict opponent's movement. Not to forget his shuriken techniques are noteworthy. Tobirama had access to shadow clone jutsu, but he wasn't as efficient as Naruto and Itachi could easily find the real tobirama with his sharingan. Ninjutsu. Father of ninjutsu sure has some awesome jutsu in his aresenal. Tobirama is known for his amazing use of water style jutsu. But does he have what it takes to beat Itachi? Well the answer is No. With the help of mangekyo sharingan, Itachi had access to amaterasu, which he can use both of offense as well as defense. Equipping susanoo with yata mirror and blade of totsuka, Itachi is invincible. Tobirama was not much of a strategist, he was offensive shinobi. I believe Itachi would knock down tobirama with ease. Genjutsu. You know the answer there. Tsukuyomi is quite troublesome even for tobirama who had quite some battles with uchihas. Tobirama was immune to genjutsu to some extent, but tsukuyomi is much bigger deal. Chakra reserves. Tobirama had much large reserves than Itachi. Even though we have neglected the health condition of Itachi, he had much less chakra reserves from beginning. Well since this is 1 vs 1 battle, itachi holds slight upper hand. But we can't say about how much time Itachi would hold himself against such strong opponent. Itachi always hated the idea of fighting. But if they are forced to kill one another, Itachi will win."},{"prompt":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","completion":"Following are the responsibilities included in [LINKED_TEXT: business analyst jobs] [URL: https://www.itekinsight.com/] : By collaborating closely with IT and financial reporting teams to establish initiatives and strategies to improve importing and optimize costs, BAs are accountable for the creation of new models that support business decisions."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for starting a successful homebased business using social media platforms (like Facebook) for selling purposes?","completion":"Starting a successful home-based business using social media platforms like Facebook for selling purposes can be an effective strategy.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Short answer - yes! I had a long debate with my husband when we were deciding the right school for our kids some years ago. We jotted down the pros & cons of different schools and finally decided to go ahead with an international school for the below reasons: Smaller Classes: For the public schools in India, the teacher to student ratio is very high. In the majority of the public schools we checked, the average ratio was around 1:60 due to which the child does not get enough attention. In international or private schools, the ratio is around 1:30, which allows individual attention to the kid's need. Extracurricular activities:Even though the primary focus must be on academics, the child should be equally exposed to other extracurricular activities such as music, dance, sports or arts, which is done more frequently in international schools. Parental Involvement: With private or international schools, you, as a parent get more opportunity to be involved in the activities of your kid. There are more meetings with the class teacher, and you are aware of what your kid is exactly doing at the school. More Exposure: We have enrolled our children in Ebenezer International School in Bangalore, which allows them more exposure to children from different communities across the world, enriching their social skills, which we think would not be possible in case of a regular public school."},{"prompt":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

If we make comparison between both the stones then there are following things that can be noticed, and, are helpful for a naive person who has to choose between marble and granite for [LINKED_TEXT: flooring tiles] [URL: https://www.marnite.co/]. Granite Tiles has a very different physical appearance as compared to marble tiles because granite stones has dotted pattern over it because of melted stones within it, and it comes in a variety of colors. Granite is a harder stone as compared to marble thus it is stronger and this hard texture of granite stone gives granite tiles more glossy, bright and shiny look. Granite tile is porous in nature, so it absorbs any liquid spilled on it and thus leave stains. The granite tile is not easy to get damaged like if a chemical liquid spills over it it does not get damaged. Now, coming towards marble stones. The first thing is difference in appearance. Marble stone comes in very typical few colors (solid grayish-white or cream color) and its very rare that it comes in other colors like pale green and pink base. Marble tiles have dark veins like pattern printed over it, because of impurities of minerals. Unlike Granite, Marbles are soft in nature and are easy to get damaged, however, marble tiles are also porous in nature and absorbs any liquid spilled over it. Marble tiles also has low chemical resistance. Therefore, Marble tiles have low durability, due to its ‘softness’ it is recommended to uses unsanded grout with marble in order to increase its durability. However, polishes and sealants can increase marble's resistance considerably. Granite's durable nature makes it suitable for Kitchen counter tops and floors, while marble is more appropriate in areas with less traffic, like bathrooms, where it can be used for vanities, tub decks, shower walls, and flooring. Marble can create a light and unique look and can be good for surfaces that will not get much use, or for people who are willing to put in the maintenance work and do not mind if their surfaces have a bit of character over time. If we talk about Cost then both marble and granite have almost equal cost.

An eSIM shouldn't be close to the edge of the telephone and could make waterproofing gadgets much simpler. – eSIM can't be actually harmed or lost: since it's installed inside gadgets. – eSIM is secure: cant' be copied. – eSIM can store various cell profiles: a few profiles can be put away so you can undoubtedly flip to choose which transporter you might want to utilize. – eSIM is anything but difficult to find: it's simpler to discover your telephone on the off chance that it is lost or taken since network suppliers can handle eSIM distantly. While eSIM has numerous advantages and it shows up more worthwhile than the actual SIM, there are still a few restrictions to the innovation: – eSIM is generally new: it is just accessible with later telephone models and chose transporters. - eSIM is more hard to move to an alternate gadget: Instead of popping the card out of an old cell phone telephone – eSIM makes it hard to distinguish the reason for an organization issue: when you have association or sign issues a simple test is to stick your SIM into an alternate telephone to check if the issue is with your organization or your gadget.

Importantly they cannot have influence because they would lose the trust that organisations have in them if they started to manipulate the market. In that respect they are more like an auditor than a part of the production process.

Can’t it just tell itself to be happy or pleasured? I just don’t get why it needs to do that if we’re basically our brains.","completion":"It is very dangerous to read something on internet and then take it for God’s own truth. I know, dopamine is implicated in feeling “happiness” but can anyone say it is causally closed? That is, high dopamine is present when one feels happy. Does that automatically mean high dopamine always makes one happy? Mental conditions like depression or OCD are associated with serotonin dysfunction. Now, tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, is present in banana. Does cramming up with banana help medically? 90% of body’s serotonin is found in the digestive system. I am not sure if anyone could explain satisfactorily, what all that serotonin is doing there. The thing is, what we know about brain chemistry is modest. Any neurotransmitter circulates through out the brain. There are some nuclei implicated for a certain behavioral effect but the net effect is resultant from the entire brain. There is a lot we need to know about brain functioning. My suggestion is, leave your brain to take care of its chemistry. Do things you love and are also constructive, lead a healthy & balanced life style and try your best to be positive, you will be doing your own brain a favor."},{"prompt":"have a fairly basic understanding of Python.

So, today, there is this whole retro game trend in the industry, with gamers, streamers, and indie studios reviving 16-bit style game art. The funny part is, people remember that style looking much less pixelated and more “realistic”, and that’s because it was. The reason was because studios used the style of TV’s back then to distort the pixel art into something more realistic. In other words, what we saw on the screen wasn’t what the art actually looked like, but a version that was warped and distorted by CRT TV monitors. the gif below shows the difference between the pixel art from Street Fighter on a current monitors vs CRT"},{"prompt":"Why is Wayne Rooney so underrated when he's the second greatest English striker of all time?","completion":"Even if he was the second best English striker ever (which is a very difficult argument to make), he's nowhere near as underrated as the best (or man it is easiest to make an argumebt for): Jimmy Greaves.

Some people might think there’s no particular purpose to life. That answer simply is not acceptable to me. That’s nihilism. Personally I’d rather fight through life, live well and die when my time comes. At some point you simply need to make that decision. Think of what religions, philosophers, activists, motivational speakers, and others tell us about life and purpose. It’s not about figuring out which group, individual, movement, school of thought, and so on is “better” than another (and I’m not saying I believe any of them or that I don’t).It’s about exposing yourself to different ideas to help you find answers you need to progress in life. Most of them have something in common : they tell us to use our gifts and do good. To me there’s one gift we all have: our brain. It is so powerful that we can bring anything we want to reality and create a world that’s better to live for any human being on the planet. We can develop skills in technology, engineering, science, art, among others to achieve that. Best of all it can also allow us to earn everything we want. Imagine realizing your dreams by making other peoples’ lives better. Now should I just follow those who say “use your gifts and do good” ? After all, I’m supposed to use my gift, my brain, and think by myself ! Well if I choose to do evil, I’m going to feel bad about it, face harsh consequences and waste my life. That’s not the way to go. Then I looked at the world right now and the things happening around me: poverty, diseases, crimes, violence, mental health issues, natural disasters, suffering everywhere. Now there are good things in the world too but that’s the way things are supposed to be anyway. So I thought why not take up the challenge of making the world a better place ? Call me a utopist but I think it’s unfair that I can live with more than I need and some people have to suffer every day of their lives. Everybody deserves a decent level of life. Period. Meaning as long as certain evil and plagues exist, we all have a purpose in life. There are so many ways one can contribute: fight the obesity epidemic, fight human trafficking, fight poverty, fight corruption, fight drug trafficking, etc… It doesn’t need to be on a spectacular scale, though. You can just choose to impact positively everyone you come across. Pick your cause and find a way to defend it.

Preferably, apply for either a bank loan from any of the major banks or a line-of-credit. They will bend over backwards to cater to you. Also, OSAP granted you loans (or grants), or amounts based on the courses you take. If you make a mistake in your application, they will withdraw it, and jeoporidze your chances of being able to finance your courses during that school year. Not to mention, the next time you apoply, you would also have to write accompanying letters (and possibly proof of earnings) for future loans and/or grants. 2.> Get a part-time job outside of the Work Study program. If you are getting OSAP, you’re limited to how much money you earn. And if you earn too much, you would have to pay OSAP some of your loan back. The Work Study program is designed to allow you to earn money within the rules of what OSAP allows you to earn. However, based on the amount of monumental expenses you are sure to encounter (i.e. overpriced parking, food, possible residence, books, etc…) it is nowhere near enough, as to what you will need. Earn as much money doing part-time jobs if you can. It will help you a lot, and free you from any economic burden in the future. 3.> Watch out for that pesky habit called procrastination. It happens to A LOT of first year students (especially if they are attending university from high school, instead of from college), and it can also creep into your second year as well. The time allowance your professors and TAs give you to finish an assignment may seem like a lot of time, but don’t get caught in the procrastination habit. It will quickly catch up to you, and you will find yourselves doing all-nighters to finish an assignment (guilty as charged). Finish your assignments as early and quickly as possible; it will help you forge proper discipline because you are definitely going to need it going into 3rd and 4th year. Also, the added benefit is that you will have more free time to do as you wish. 4.> Do summer courses when you can. This is designed to help you finish your courses faster to get your degree- fast-tracking. Take advantage, because courses during the summer are easier to get (less class conflicts and more open vacancies), and sometimes the cost for the summer courses are cheaper. Yes its a pain when all the other kids are on vacation, but it will pay-off in the long run 5.> Avoid bird courses, and take courses to fulfill your prerequisites and credits. During my time (which is only a few years ago), many of the kids I went to school with took the easy courses, and never paid attention to the prerequisites required to graduate with the major or specialist program they applied for to begin with. When you take all bird courses, and you enter fourth year, you’re then now scrambling to take required courses to graduate. This is a pain that is easily avoidable from first year- and something you don’t want to contend with in your later years 6.> Avoid driving to school at all costs; take the bus and/or bike. Parking at U of T, no matter what campus, is ridiculously expensive, and that was when I attended. I can only fathom how much parking passes has gone up since then. And don’t count on parking on the side streets. City parking officers monitor ALL side streets around whichever campus you attend like a hawk, and more likely than not, you will receive a ticket. Also, the people that live on those streets WILL call the city if they find a whole bunch of students parking their cars there. Also, don’t think about parking on campus parking lots, thinking you can get away without paying for 5 minutes. They do have parking personnel monitoring all the lots like nobody’s business- they leave no stone unturned. 7.> Take advantage of the different insurance coverage offered. For instance, take advantage of the dental or whatever else that is available. The cost is added to your tuition, but it is nominal at best. 8.> Don’t buy text books if you can. Instead, take advantage of the library and or the professor’s copy in the short-term loans sections. University of Toronto has a relatively new and expanded library (no thanks to the expensive tuition), and Robarts Library on the downtown campus are excellent places to visit. The problem is, depending on the course, the version of the book you buy changes every year. History books you might be able to get away with buying a new or used one, and refer to it for years after. However in the CCIT (Culture, Communications and Information Technology) program, in a number of courses, the information changes almost every year- and hence the version. This is important to note, because it affects what is on the exam, or even the mid-term exam. An older version of a book will not always cut it, when the exam is tailored to a newer version of the same book. However, the library or the professors’ copy, always keep their content up-to-date. Borrowing from these sources are an excellent way to save money. 9.> Research the job market. And keep tabs on the job market. Do this before you choose your major/minor, and every year until graduation. The last thing you want to do is to choose your major/minor and or courses and not being able to find a job in that field, or a related field. Even if you initially choose a course, and the job market shifts suddenly, you’re still safe in switching courses/major into your second year. I cannot tell you how many of my friends who went to college found jobs, in their fields, a lot faster than the people I went to university with. And don’t depend on your professors to guide you in this regard- they’re useless, but then again, they are there to teach, not offer job counselling. But even the counsellors aren’t the best either. Either do your own leg-work, or do networking. Well, that’s all I can come up with off the top of my head. If I can think of anything more, I will add it to my response."},{"prompt":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","completion":"I think we will have embedded devices that will extrude through an opening in our forearms that allow certain processes to occur that still require external manipulations to the internalized extruding device.

Typically, but with some exceptions (particularly, often as with some big game long-range hunting rifle calibres), long-range, high-powered rounds are missile shaped in order to reduce drag and prevent wobble/tumbling, and preserve likelihood of accuracy for the better part of the flight so that the payload effectively gets deployed according to its design. Sidearms, on the other hand, are intended to stop fleeing assailants or as countermeasures against close-quarter threats. While dependable accuracy is rather important, it is closer to being tied with maximum stopping power used within its intended effective range. Therefore, with exception to special purpose (piercing, etc) rounds, manufacturers tend to favor a softer, denser lead or composite whose payload deployment is aided/hastened by a more rounded or blunt tip…smashes easier and sooner to ensure that the in-hole is a fairly smaller diameter than the out-hole, if it goes straight through.

Maurice (who was not an idiot and taught me how to work) makes sure one more time. He tells her he can’t charge her less. Then he tells the grill guys, “That Big Mac order with double everything, don’t put meat on it.” The grill guys double check that Maurice hasn’t lost his marbles, “Really?” And “really?” By now I’ve rung her up for the sandwiches and I’m waiting for the disbelief to die down so she can tell me what happy meals the kids want.

If I like a person, I cherish that so much that I avoid situations, which could result in my friends being tested or showing their negative side. Instead, I carefully try to keep the people I like around me; I make conscious efforts to preserve the good thoughts and sensations that attracted me to my friends in the first place. I simply like to like them better than I need a friend. Life is not easy, so when hard times come, they inevitably show who of my friends is ready to help and is there for me.

The writers that last long enough to build careers are the happy writers, and the happiest writers aren’t bothered by the idea that sometimes, they’re going to look silly. Let me explain: Last week, I met up for coffee with a friend who I hadn’t seen in 7 years. I’m 24, so 7 years feels like a lifetime ago. 7 years ago, I was 17 years old. I was still in high school. I was a child who was anxious and depressed all the time and didn’t even know what those words meant. I was insecure about everything. I was a pain to be around because all I did was project my bad feelings and insecurities onto other people. I hadn’t started writing. I hadn’t started doing Jiu-Jitsu. Not that I’m spitting Aristotle-like wisdom at 24, but compared to who I am now, I was an idiot. My friend is way smarter than me. He always has been. However, he has been struggling with some of the same problems I did when I started writing. He wants to write essays. He wants to teach people stuff. He wants to help people improve their lives through philosophy. The problem is, he, like most new writers, is terrified of publishing and submitting himself to judgment. In short, he’s afraid of looking like an idiot. As a 24-year-old who writes “life advice-ish” stuff on the internet, I run the risk every day of seeming like a know-it-all. I run the risk of coming off as conceited and arrogant. There are plenty of people who are way wiser than me. They have this little thing called “life experience” that I just don’t have yet. I have my experiences, but I can’t really talk about things that I don’t know. If you ever catch me writing parenting advice, sound the alarm. If you’re on the internet looking for the wisest dude with a blog, you probably should not read my work. To a lot of very wise people, I probably seem like an idiot. To them, according to the critic in my head, I should stop writing and stop talking like I know anything about anything. The other day, a reader told me that I should “join a 12 step program and stop trying to justify my defeatist worldview”. This is just the reality of trying to create things. No matter who you are and what you achieve, there will always be someone who thinks you’re an idiot. You have to learn to not be afraid to look like an idiot. If you want to be vulnerable in public, you have to deal with the fact that sometimes, people just aren’t going to pick up what you’re putting down. If you write or create content, you have to deal with the fact that sometimes people are going to think things about you, and sometimes they’re going to think things that you don’t like. No matter how good of a persuasive writer you are, you can’t control everyone’s mind. So, you have 2 choices: You can put yourself out there and accept the possibility of failure.Or you can quit before you start and never put anything into the world. Both are valid options. Looking like an idiot isn’t fun. However, if you have the burning desire to create and tell stories (through music or art or writing or whatever), remember that you can only shove that desire down for so long you become resentful. Eventually, it will consume you. That is heartbreaking to watch. Happy artists will risk looking stupid and be okay with it. Happy artists are peaceful artists. Once, a reader online told me that I didn’t understand what it was like to be an artist. Apparently, I didn’t understand the burning anxiety that comes with the desire to create every single day nor did I understand the anxious anticipation that artists feel before they produce their work. I “just didn’t get it”. Honestly, however, “you just don’t get it” sounds like what I’d tell my mom and dad when I was in high school going through my photography phase. It’s a bullshit comment. If you have the desire to express yourself, you’re an artist of some kind. Being an artist has a really low bar for entry. You don’t need to be talented to be an artist. A child’s finger painting projects from preschool art class fall into the same category as the Mona Lisa. They’re both “art”. That bothers a lot of people, but it doesn’t bother the child. If no one has planted the idea in the child’s head that art has to look a certain way, judgment is not a factor. When you can accept your art for what it is (an expression of yourself) and detach from the grandiose expectations that you attach to it, you’ll become happier, more peaceful, and you’ll enjoy your work more. Ironically, this is probably what will also make you more successful. I understand what it’s like to battle insecurities as an artist/creator. In quarantine last year, I wrote an entire 70k word novel that will probably never be published. Half of my articles will never be published. I’ve abandoned every single creative pursuit I’ve begun besides writing. The 2 biggest problems that hold back young content creators are fear and inconsistency, and the former largely creates the latter. The fear of looking stupid is a very real and valid emotion, but this fear is amplified by the anxious mind. It’s a valid feeling, but it’s not an excuse. No matter how it is you want to express yourself, you will never be free from judgment. However, you can become free from the negative emotions associated with it through practice, self-awareness, and mental training. When it comes to establishing sustained creative flow, there is no goal that is more worthwhile."},{"prompt":"Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?","completion":"Because, one way or another, s/he is the principal data recording and analysis device."},{"prompt":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

This is where, few days back I started doubting myself. And self doubt combined with overthinking is not a good combination, people. This is where I frantically asked a wise friend of mine, “Am I not a good person?” He calmly replied, “There's no good or bad person. We all are a combination of both. It is just that some people are 80% good and then they do some selfish things that makes them 20% bad. Some people are 80% selfish and then they do some good things that make them 20% good\\" “Never ask this question to anyone\\", he continued. “If you ask this to someone and suppose they say yes, you are not a good person.

Will she use wildfire in the books to kill all her enemies like she did in GoT?","completion":"No, I would not go as far as to say “madness”, and I don’t expect she will ever go that far. She does however show signs of being increasingly paranoid, and once shows signs of actual delusion. Her paranoia mostly exhibits itself in the following ways: After Maggy the Frog’s valonqar prophesy, she is paranoid that Tyrion is going to kill her. The prophesy states:“And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”Valonqar (as far as Cersei understands it) means “little brother” in valyrian. She assumes this refers to Tyrion, and that he will try to kill her. There is a large population of the ASOIAF fan base (myself included) that speculate that if she is killed by a younger brother, it will be Jamie. He is technically younger given he was born second. Given Cersei is frequently wrong, GRRM has a propensity for misdirection, and it is mentioned in the books that he was born second, it seems highly likely this will come to pass in some form or another.Once Tywin is killed she becomes even more paranoid, believing that Tyrion is still in King’s Landing, living in the walls, and will eventually try to kill her. She gets increasingly obsessed with that idea.She has an obsession with fire. She has the Tower of the Hand burned down after Tywin is killed, in part because she believes Tyrion is still hiding in there. While watching the tower burn, and she watches it burn for a long time, with a feeling of almost ecstacy. I expect this is a sign she will eventually at least try to use wildfyre (though not in exactly the way it was done in the show.) This may motivate Jamie to have to kill her to prevent that. However, that is speculation, and I digress.She is paranoid about Margaery, leading her to arm the Faith Militant, which we all know how that works out. She also exhibits a sick level of cruelty on others. She offers up her former friend Falyce Stokeworth to Qyburn so he can do experiments on her in the black cells. All because Falyce knows too much about Cersei’s plans. We don’t get to see exactly what happens but later Qyburn mentions that she can no longer feed herself. Cersei is not even disturbed by the implications of what he must have been doing to her to cause that. She has the Blue Bard, a singer, tortured to get him to falsely admit that he slept with Margaery. All to try and get Margaery thrown in jail. (Which is also another sign of her cruelty.) Her level of constant manipulation of Jamie ever since they were children, to the point to where she in part influences the Mad King’s decision to take on Jamie as a member of his King’s Guard, just so he will not leave her, is a sign of extreme selfishness. The one time where she exhibits what some might percieve as a mental issue is when she is doing her “Walk of Shame” to the Red Keep. Towards the end she starts thinking she sees people from her past, Ned, Tywin, etc. I still don’t believe she is mad in this because she stops short of actually believing they are there. She knows her paranoia and stress is causing this. So I think this shows a high sense of mental distress in the moment, but not mental illness or madness. I believe these are the signs of a cruel, paranoid, and manipulative person. A narcissistic person. Honestly, she’s just terrible. No redeeming qualities in the books. This is however not the same as madness. She does not have a mental illness. And although highly paranoid at times, she is never divorced from reality. Her cruel actions are driven by calculated plans to get what she wants. Cold and heartless, but not mad. So no, I don’t believe she is or will ever be truly mad."},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"“Mom, how did you both meet?” “Dad upvoted all my answers, sweetie!”"},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"The shrewdest and smartest maneuver I have ever seen in business was when Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

The nominees: Richard Burton from Anne of the Thousand Days, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight both for Midnight Cowboy, Peter O’Toole for Goodbye Mr. Chips, and who wins it- John Wayne for True Grit. I enjoy John Wayne films, alot, but, I find Mr. Wayne mostly has the same charactor in his films, and the other actors’ performances in 1969 were all better that year than Mr. Wayne, who clearly won on sentimentality. As for competition, toughest competitions for Best Actor included the performances of the men in 1939, 1940, 1951, 1962, 1964, 1985, and 1988. There are more but I have to stop somewhere. As an aside, I am somewhat bugged about actors, and actresses that receive nominations for a leading performance, wherein it was a supporting performance, and vice versa. For example, and I have mixed feelings about it. In 1991, there really was no leading male performance in Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins who won the Oscar, and deserved one, but was it a leading or supporting performance? Some days I think it was a leading performance, and other days I think it was for a truly magnificent performance in the supporting actor category. This now brings me to the subject of Geena Davis. When Melanie Griffith announced that Miss Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar for her touching, amazing performance in The Accidental Tourist, I went through the roof. But, thinking about it, I wonder if this was more a leading performance? I am really confused as to what constitutes a supporting, and a leading role If you think the Best Actor category has been difficult, look at the performances for the Best Supporting Actress, and no year, for me, was more difficult than in 1973 (1972 comes extremely close.) The nominees were: Madeline Kahn for Paper Moon, Candy Clark for American Graffiti, Linda Blair for The Exorcist, Silvia Sidney for Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams. The winner was Tatum O’Neal, and here we go again folks, I thought the role of Addie Loggins in Paper Moon, was a leading performance, and NOT a supporting performance. BUT THAT’S ME."},{"prompt":"What is the easiest and best way to wake up in the morning?","completion":"So as a quick tip: It’s old news that a cold shower will wake you up super easily. The problem is, taking a cold shower in the morning absolutely sucks. A low-hanging fruit that also works—after you brush your teeth, run cold water over your hands and forearms. Try to let the cold water touch lots of skin and keep it running over, holding the position, then, put your face down into the sink and let the cold water go over your face. Hold it for 5–10 seconds and I guarantee you’ll wake up more. Not only that, cold water causes a dopamine release that has no crash (falling below baseline dopamine).

For link building methods and SEO to be as effective as possible, it's critical to comprehend the differences between different link categories. • Google does not receive page authority or important signals from no follow links. They essentially \\"tell\\" Google not to crawl the linked website or follow a link. Links that aren't very relevant or could perplex Google's crawlers are frequently used as no follow links. They avoid undermining the legitimacy of the connecting page. • Links that Google considers to be \\"do follow\\" provide page authority and indicate the significance and authority of the connected page. These links actively raise the linked website or page's search rating in Google Search results. Due to the fact that they transfer link equity from one domain to another, do follow links are crucial for link building SEO. Other important considerations regarding no follow vs. do follow connections • The majority of external links, or those that point from your website to a page outside of it, are by default do follow links. However, a lot of CMSs and link builders will produce some no follow links. • Internal links, or those that connect pages within your own website, are frequently do-follow links. However, \\"canonical\\" URLs are occasionally designated as no follow. • Although less than do follow links, no follow links nevertheless convey some PageRank and link equity to the connected website. Better than none is some PageRank. • New links from reputable, high-quality domains have the best chance of raising ranks. Make sure all links you create are designated as do follow by checking them twice. • A no follow link cannot be made to become a do follow link, and vice versa. The type of connection is determined by the link anchor and markup, not by the website that is connected or linking. • Steer clear of \\"link schemes\\" when numerous websites exchange links or spam links with one another. These links often have no follow and are not very helpful for SEO. • Increase links naturally by publishing valuable, high-quality material. By producing authoritative content and beneficial connections, you may earn links the proper way. That will result in links that are dofollow and affect rankings. • Check your website's profiles in Google Search Console to check the kinds of links (do follow vs. no follow) that Google is discovering. Make changes as necessary to obtain more do follow links."},{"prompt":"Why is defence production low in India compared to China?","completion":"Because of decades of Congress Rule who prevented Defence Production by Indian Industries in India so that they can import every Defence Item from Abroad for Reasons best known to them as well as the General Public."},{"prompt":"Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?","completion":"They can!."},{"prompt":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","completion":"This is not a joke, per se, but Ernie Ball, who owned a guitar store, told me he would laugh (to himself) when a lady taking lessons asked him, seriously, “How often do I have to tune my guitar?”"},{"prompt":"have a theory that Gammaray bursts are really planets setting off imploded cylindrical uranium, gun type nuclear devices and gamma ray lazing.

Modern cavers use compasses, hand-drawn sketches on paper or tablets, and laser distance and inclinometer measuring devices. They use the range finders to measure the distance between selected points throughout the cave passage—the result is a line plot, an imaginary line running throughout the entire cave. We also take frequent measurements from that line to the walls, floor, and ceiling. The sketcher draws the shape of the passage, taking those measurements into account. Later, sketches and measurements are then entered into computer programs to create the final product. Map making is an art with established symbology; cavers enter map contests every year at the NSS (caves.org). Derek Bristol's educational cave videos explain better than I could!

I did not include the 1950s team because I did not think it would be competitive with the other decades. I did not include the teams in the 21st century because I haven’t followed them as closely. While I agree that the overall quality of play is better today than in earlier decades, that doesn’t mean that there were not individual superstars of those eras every bit as good as the stars of today. I have seen every player in their prime, so I have that perspective. Following the examples of other responders, I have listed 5 players for each decade. It would have been preferable to have listed 10 players for each decade so we had a complete team, but I followed the examples of the others. I may add a second unit later. Also, consistent with one of the other responders, I restricted every player to only one decade. I notice that one poster fudged and put LeBron in for both the decades of the 21st century. I agree that he may have deserved a position in each of the two decades, but that is cheating a little (lol). I could have put Jordan and K. Malone is for both the 80s and 90s, but included them only in the 90s team. Here are a few observations: 1. Best offensive team- 1960s. Every one of the 5 players had averaged 30+ ppg. 2.

It’s Joe Biden’s fault. 🤪🤪🤪😎"},{"prompt":"Will it be a cake walk for the SP, BSP alliance to win the Uttar Pradesh election? What will be the position for BJP and Congress?","completion":"Not really. SP and BSP along with RLD has vote percentage of 22.2+22.0+1.8 =46.00% as against 39.7% of BJP as per the 2017 State legislative elections which is a good 6.3% lead haven't considered 1% of Apna Dal which will bring down this difference to 5.3%. However state elections are different from national elections. If last Loksabha elections is considerd then then BJP got 42.3% where as SP BSP got 22.2% and 19.6% ie total 41.8%. So it will be a tough fight between the SP BSP alliance and BJP. The catch here is in politics the simple arithmetic won't work. SP and BSP are major players in UP wherein at all constituencies they are rivals along with the BJP. So if they decide to contest together it's sure that ther will be discontent within the party. These parties are not in power and will stay out of power in state atleast till 2022, hence giving a fancy post or vidhan Parishad seat or something like that will not be possible. This disgruntled leaders will either join BJP/Congress or fight as independent and in the worst case say away from campain and wont promote the candidates. This is expected to happen at more than 50% Seats. As the difference in vote share is just 5/6% loosing these votes will reduce the difference. SP was ruling UP till 2017. Last BSP ruled UP was between 2007-12. As BSP has been out of power for more than half decade it has affected the morale of the party workers as well as the voters. That's the reason why in last couple of years many local Dalit parties have cropped up. Similarly SP has been out of power for 2 years now and another 3 years to go for change at state level as next elections are due only in 2022. Additionally SP has seen a fraction breaking away, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) of Shivpal Yadav. These two factors will do harm to SP BSP alliance. And finally if SP/BSP will go solo without INC it will be a face less side where as it will be contesting a strong face of Modi. The Modi magic is still more than Akhilesh and Maya magic. Hence it is in no way going to be a cake walk for any one."},{"prompt":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule?

EDIT: Israel still applies Jordanian law to the civil administration of Judea and Samaria."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Rangers and airborne divisions?","completion":"Airborne just means you've jumped out of a plane 5 times or more, it's an individual qualification. An airborne *division* includes some people who never have and never will jump, but that's another matter. Airborne school comes before ranger school and is typically a general/assumed requirement. Ranger school itself is a lot longer and involves quite a bit more than being able to fall out of a plane and probably not die. (And yes, you *fall* out of the plane, you don't jump unless you want to drastically increase the odds of injury or death) To put it another way, you could say that everyone in an airborne division has at least seen a car and the vast majority of them have driven one. A ranger has been in actual races like nascar or better or has at least been trained and tested to qualify for the attempt. Special forces is another matter, they know how to function as a small team of about 12 people with the skills to put a bunch of civillians to work mining and smelting and forming the metal needed to engineer and build the cars and the track for the race. While they're doing that, a bunch of others are brewing tons of beer and a few are secretly distilling liquor to smuggle into the place on race day. While those people doing all that stuff have a few hours off here and there, they zoom off to all the other villages to hand out tickets to the race. Another way of putting it is that being in an airborne unit is like having eaten at mcdonald's. Being a ranger is like having worked in one. Being special forces is like you've built at least one from the ground up, probably more like four of them, and you own them. Task force delta is a little different. They're more like a customer who can walk in and just buy the whole damned place, even if the owner doesn't want to sell."},{"prompt":"What are the key characteristics of a lean system?","completion":"There are several. I'll point out a few. The goal is to produce (in a factory. For a service company this would be different) your parts in a single piece flow. This means no inventory and no (minimal) buffers between production stages. This goal requires several things to be aligned. Each process step would need to require the same amount of time, or you would need multiple parallel processes so that the effective process time would be halved. When each process has a different process time, you will automatically create buffers. There are many reasons to work towards a single piece flow, but one of the most important ones is to make problems visible. And problems is what you want to see and address. Now comes the most important part that is almost always overlooked. You want your people on the work floor to show and address the problems. This means that they need to learn how to analyse the problems and to come up with ideas to address them. In many companies this is done by e.g. adding buffers, but that's not the right way as it removes you from the single piece flow. People need to be able to experiment with different ideas which will ONLY work if they are allowed to make mistakes in the process. This means that you need a culture with psychological safety. And that is what is missing in many companies. When people are judged by errors and hitting the numbers, no-one will come forward with problems and they will certainly not invest time to analyse the problem. Their goal is to hide errors and to continue producing to make the numbers."},{"prompt":"..I was driving in Dubai. Traffic signal was turning yellow.

In the situation you mention, if the front tyres of your vehicle crossed the line before the signal turned red, the chances of being fined are unlikely. However, it is best to err on the side of caution and to always drive according to the laws in the area. This will ensure that you stay safe and abide by local laws."},{"prompt":"What are the rules of cooking in clay pots? What are it's pros and cons?","completion":"There are no specific rules for clay cooking and any chef would be more happy to have this as a cooking material. If you are an enthusiastic cooker and an equally enthusiastic environmentalist, then you probably know all about pure clay cookware, which has been receiving appreciations from the cooking for a good number of years. Pros of pure clay pots Pure clay is inert, which means it won't react with your food. Even if that wasn't the case, clay is filled with nutrients like magnesium and calcium, as opposed to toxins and chemicals like metal cookware. None of that will ever leach into your food of you use clay pots. They're also unglazed, the pure clay ones, which is another health benefit. Additionally, the lid of the pot is not letting the steam evaporate, thus losing all essential vitamins and nutrients from the food you're cooking. Instead, all steam is sent back into the food, making it not only a lot more delicious, but richer in nutrients. Apart from the fact that clay cooking is healthier for us, it's also healthier for the environment. First, the clay is not mined, so the land is not stripped or damaged in any way, Secondly, manufacturing clay pots boils down to hard working potters throwing them on the wheel, so not much energy or resources are wasted in the process. Last, but not least, they can last you a lifetime, but even if they don't, they're 100% biodegradable. Cooking in clay also involves using little to no fat or oil. The vessels are non-stick because of all the steam being kept inside and the food releasing its own, natural juices. It works great for vegans, but anyone should enjoy food without any fats and oils. Now, as far as convenience goes, clay cookware is quite versatile. This means you can use the same pot to make tons of dishes, whether they are cooked in the oven or on stove-top. You can bake, grill, fry, braise, whatever you want with the same clay pot. Pros of clay pots The only disadvantage of clay cookware is that it can get a little pricey. If you're going for the 100 % pure clay, unglazed, real thing, which you definitely should, then you can expect to pay a substantial price. You can use these pots for decades provided of course that you take care of them properly. They're truly the best cookware on the market."},{"prompt":"w do police arrest large, aggressive men?

These are outside investors that are typically rich individuals that have an emotional attachment to the business/idea and want to see the company succeed.VCs. These guys are professional investors. of these, the 3 fs are you inside investors. The rest are clearly outside investors.

By the time something is a theory it already has supporting data behind it. In any case, it happens all the time. If you want an example that is right in your face for much of the population let’s look at the statin market. Pfizer’s Lipitor (atorvastatin) was a leader amongst about a dozen statins, but not totally dominant. One of their competitors hypothesized that their statin was more effective at preventing heart attacks than other statins. So they ran a trial to prove their hypothesis. When the results came back they had proven that Lipitor, not their drug, was the most effective at preventing heart attacks. That instantly made Lipitor the dominant statin, because how could a doctor or insurance company favor a drug that was less effective at doing the thing it was most intended to do? Even if another drug was equally as good at reducing LDL cholesterol, or better, unless it did a better job at actually reducing heart attacks why would you use it? Note: some people are still prescribed other statins because they have worse side effects from atorvastatin, or it doesn’t work as well on them as the general population for reducing cholesterol, or they didn’t have insurance and wanted a cheaper option before the Lipitor patents expired, or…. But overall, if you have high cholesterol you will be put on atorvastatin because someone’s hypothesis about their drug’s superior effectiveness ended up proving that it was atorvastatin that was most effective. Oops."},{"prompt":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","completion":"I’m a voiceover artist. (Artist is a weird description; I don’t paint or create sculptures. 😂) One job I had was as the voice of artificial intelligence. The client wanted a voice that could create any and all possible responses from a computer. The meeting point was a University campus. I was directed to a lone little outhouse. ‘It’s an anechoic chamber,’ said the client. An anechoic chamber is an utterly soundproof room in which noise doesn’t reverberate. You can’t hear anything outside, and the outside can’t hear you. Everything goes dead, and the silence is deafening and odd. You can hear your own heartbeat. Sometimes, people even lose their balance or start to hallucinate if they’re in there long enough. As soon as he locked the door behind me, my pulse rate increased. I thought, ‘No one on this campus knows I’m in here, and they can’t hear a sound from inside…not even a chainsaw.’ 😂 As if that wasn’t creepy enough, he then sat me in a wooden chair in front of a microphone and a monitor (all normal so far) but then he tied my wrists to the armrests! Oooh, that’s new. He explained it was because they wanted no slight movements or increased energy to interfere with the vocals. Everything had to remain even. Erm… My mind was scrambling for all the hacks I’d learned from YouTube videos. ‘How to slide out from zip ties etc’ I thought ‘Wow. I’m gonna die on a university campus, in plain sight. A mop and a few bottles of bleach and no one will ever even know there was a murder victim in this chamber.’ But, it turned out to be a legit job. (I had faith in my agent.) I sat, tied to that chair, for SIX hours (with breaks,) regurgitating every letter, combination of letters, every word, every sentence and inflection known to man. Everything necessary to give AI the capability to utter any sentence under the sun. By hour five, I found myself wishing I’d just been murdered with a chainsaw."},{"prompt":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","completion":"you dont.

It allows you to take control of your diet, cook healthier meals, save money, and impress your friends and family. If you're new to cooking, it can be a daunting task. However, with a little bit of guidance and practice, you can become a confident and skilled cook in no time. 1. Start with the basics: Before you dive into complex recipes, it's essential to learn the basics. Learn how to boil pasta, cook rice, fry an egg, and make a simple sandwich. These simple tasks will help you develop essential cooking skills, such as sautéing, boiling, and frying. 2. Invest in quality equipment: Cooking is much easier when you have the right tools. Invest in a good set of knives, a cutting board, measuring cups, and spoons, and a few good quality pots and pans. These tools will make cooking much more manageable and enjoyable. 3. Follow recipes: When you're starting, it's best to follow recipes to the letter. Choose recipes that are easy to follow, and don't require too many ingredients or complicated techniques. As you gain confidence, you can start experimenting with your recipes, but it's best to start with the basics. 4. Learn cooking techniques: Cooking is all about techniques. Learn how to sauté, braise, roast, grill, and bake. Each technique requires different cooking methods, and learning them will help you become a more versatile cook. 5. Learn about ingredients: Understanding ingredients is essential for good cooking. Learn about different herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars. Learn how to pair ingredients and how to use them in different dishes. 6. Practice, practice, practice: Like any skill, cooking requires practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, and don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't turn out as expected. Keep practicing, and you'll develop your cooking skills over time. 7. Join a cooking class: If you want to take your cooking to the next level, consider joining a cooking class. Cooking classes allow you to learn from experienced chefs, and they provide an opportunity to try out new recipes and techniques. 8. Watch cooking shows: Watching cooking shows is an excellent way to learn new recipes and techniques. There are many cooking shows available online or on TV, and they provide an excellent source of inspiration and education. 9. Cook with others: Cooking with others is a fun and social way to learn how to cook. Invite friends over for a cooking party, or join a cooking club or group. Cooking with others allows you to share ideas and learn from each other. 10. Have fun: Cooking should be fun and enjoyable. Don't stress too much about getting everything perfect or making the perfect dish. Enjoy the process, and remember that cooking is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. In conclusion, learning to cook takes time, patience, and practice. Start with the basics, invest in quality equipment, follow recipes, learn cooking techniques, and experiment with ingredients. Join a cooking class, watch cooking shows, cook with others, and most importantly, have fun. With these tips, you'll be on your way to becoming a confident and skilled cook in no time.

The barn used to be red colored. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s? Why did they use red anyway?","completion":"By the early 1900s, red paint was commonly available. In decades prior, it was often made on the farm. Whatever is bring marketed as ‘barn red' will work well enough. Sometimes you'll see a ‘colonial red', which would also work. Expect whatever you use to fade rapidly in the sunlight. You may wish to go a tad dark so it fades to what you want after a few years and won't be too pink by the time it's due for a repainting."},{"prompt":"Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?","completion":"One can’t generalize whether Hindi language is meant to unite Indians or trigger Indians. It is just a truth that we live in a nation named India with known boundaries and those people living in that specific area are Indians. People can seek life anywhere in the nation. And it also happens Hindi is spoken by the majority of the persons in the country. In States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha etc. they have a local languages. But people in these areas understand Hindi. Even in Bangalore, anyone in the road understands Hindi. The humans have the need to communicate. Why not do the same in the language known to people? Hating the system is not going to help me. Everyone has to live with the system whatever be the way the system is. My opinion is hating Hindi or any language is not going to help me. Finding my way forward is what is important for me. When our country is such that majority of the people know and understand Hindi, better I know speaking Hindi. I can program myself not to be triggered. How people perceive this issue is what matters for them. Politicians are the only persons who benefit by triggering people. Why must we benefit politicians? ‘Work hard and smart in my way forward’ is my motto and not to complain in the system."},{"prompt":"Where has Indian media gone wrong?","completion":"She is Suchandrima. A journalist from West Bengal, India. We all know how badly the super cyclone Amphan hit West Bengal and Odisha, the adjacent states of Bay of Bengal. This was possibly the worst storm hit to the state of Bengal in last 300 years. Lakhs of people have lost their last resorts and literally going through the worst time of their life. First the fear of deadly coronavirus, then this terrible terrible cyclone. And there is the lady, reporting from ground zero. There she is one of the few hopes of Journalism in India. Now, just don't tell me that REAL JOURNALISM is vanished from our country because you and me are obsessed with some of the PRIME TIME FACES. Your obsession with some news anchors who think that their place is just after the Prime Minister and Home Minister of this country, does not imply that there aren't any professional who are sticking to their primary ethics even at this time. You can be a stern critic or an admirer of those GIGANTIC NOISE MAKERS, but in both cases you are wasting your time on incorrigible beings who are getting PAID for dividing my country in every possible way. Watch those funny edited videos on youtube, laugh and forget. Lets be clear, That is not journalism. This one is. And I don't care about which news channel she is part of, not interested about which party leader has bought a share of that channel. All I see is an individual who is honest towards her own profession. Also, If you think that this is a publicity stunt, then let it be. If anyone, an org or individual wants to get popular by doing act like this, then we should make them popular. More power to you; Madam and more power to all of those journalists of this country who are sticking at their basics and giving voice to the voiceless, to the downtrodden, to them whose cry are not being heard by our establishments.

The person with the camera in his hand is Kaushik Chatterjee.]"},{"prompt":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test? If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"This kind of scenario did not actually happen to me and a little bit different but my husband had an ex and they’ve been together for 3 yrs so going back when we started our relationship (June 2009) together month after their separation (no formal closure) his ex suddenly made an announcement to his family that she is pregnant (July 2009) and so my agony has begun and my partner confessed that something happened between him and ex etc.. we still continue our relationship despite of the situation and I swallowed all his family’s ill mouthed words and constant bashing towards me since they are strongly in favor of his ex so moving forward the ex girlfriend posted a photo of a newborn april 2010 and his family got excited with so many comments, compliments. They even made the baby boy as their profile picture and met with ex and the baby boy to intentionally hurt me. Fast forward of constant spying, stalking on social media and never-ending social media war December of 2011 I created a dummy account by copying the ex girlfriend’s cousin account and boom! I found out that the boy wasn’t his at all, the baby picture with his true parents during baptism and 1st birthday he also had an electronic invitation all relatives tagged including the nasty ex girlfriend I found out the baby boy is her nephew after all. I exposed all of them on fb the baby boy really looks like his true father! so imagine the emotional damage that my in-laws caused towards me? from 2009 up until now it’s already damaged and i’m not comfy enough to share my life with them. No apologies made from them. 2012 - the sister of ex girlfriend confessed to my bf (now husband) that ex gf had a miscarriage 2014 - we got married and i’m still not comfy with my in laws From the beginning my husband don’t have any special bond or feeling that he is the father."},{"prompt":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","completion":"Democrats are not ‘afraid’ of Christians. REAL ‘Christians’ do NOT inflict blunt force trauma on others with the Cross, that is exactly the opposite of what the Church actually teaches. Nor do REAL ‘Christians’ attempt to force THEIR religious beliefs down the throats of others via governments or schools (although they feel free to say exactly the same thing about others when others simply seek to live their lives in peace and happiness). You are free to practice your faith as you see fit. You are NOT, however, permitted to judge me because I am Catholic, because I do not attend YOUR Church, because I do not practice according to your dictates. Nor may you impose your belief on me or my company via your business decisions. Where I attend Church, which Church, and who my circle of friends are, are NOT deciding factors in how I conduct business. If those are the benchmarks you use to decide where to do business, stay where you are, do not leave your County and do not interact with the rest of the world. We had millennia of of religious oppression in its varying forms, and no longer tolerate that bigotry. You are NOT the Holy Inquisition, and you never will be. If you are one of those “Old White Men” trying to superimpose your beliefs (US Supreme Court take note) or preserve your power and control, the sooner you ‘shuffle off this mortal coil’ the better."},{"prompt":"Which Turkic country has the purest Turks?","completion":"Turkmens ([LINKED_TEXT: Turkmen] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_language]: Türkmenler, Түркменлер, توركمنلر‎, [LINKED_TEXT: [tʏɾkmɛnˈlɛɾ]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Turkmen]; historically the Turkmen), also known as Turkmen Turks ([LINKED_TEXT: Turkmen] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_language]: Türkmen türkleri, توركمن تورکلری‎), [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmens#cite_note-10] [LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmens#cite_note-11] [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmens#cite_note-12] are a [LINKED_TEXT: Turkic ethnic group] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples] native to [LINKED_TEXT: Central Asia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia], living mainly in [LINKED_TEXT: Turkmenistan] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan], northern and northeastern regions of [LINKED_TEXT: Iran] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran] and [LINKED_TEXT: Afghanistan] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan].

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"At an IQ of 150. Individuals may share enough in common with peers that socially and emotionally they may still fit in on the surface, but many will feel internally out of synch, as they go through the motions, they are usually socially indifferent and hold back a lot. Children at this IQ level are far ahead of age peers. For example, a chronological six-year-old will be four years ahead intellectually, and a ten-year-old, seven years ahead. This lead is maintained throughout ones’ life. However a young student of an IQ of 150+ is usually naive to the faulty logic that the majority adopts to run its society. There is the phenomenon of herd behavior and escape panic that such individuals have to get around. The tiring sense of being bogged down by the inertia and lack of understanding and want to understand in people, they just want you to confirm their own prejudiced beliefs to them, garner them “status”. “ I spoke to an IQ 150 today and he agrees that there’s not much truth to the communication barrier.” Obviously it is a matter of not stressing the bandwidth and fidelity of the connection by communicating adequately and not over their heads, it is usually impolite to insist such things, even if they are true. Our society thinks in labels and roles. Finally, never be fooled by their education or their talents ...... They don't know how to apply their learning to themselves or others once removed from their roles & labels. Remember. they live and \\"think\\" through labels and are incapable of perceiving reality clearly. This means that you can get them to jump through hoops by simply manipulating their labels ...... If you find them doing something which interferes with your plans. simply \\"throw\\" them a tasty label and watch them munch their way through it. I’ve been pointing this out for years, if you recall. But because I don’t think like the less intelligent, I am regularly labeled everything from stupid to “elitist”. In my experience, the 150 IQ individual does not resent the individual with the 160 or the 175 IQ, and this may be because being above 145, we all tend to engage in similar thought processes or more likely possess asymptotically similar values [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #xpsfU], albeit with different capabilities. The 135 IQ individual dislikes and fears the 150+ individuals, while the 115 IQ individual either doesn’t believe the 150+ individuals exist or blithely insists that they are crazy, failures or somehow defective.As Sergio Carvajal said: 1. To pursue credentials in academic institutions, specifically to get hold of (and then flaunt) what they consider to be socially sanctioned proof of their intelligence. These people actually want honorifics, letters after their names and to dress in bat capes at conventions of like-minded people. 2. These people are unoriginal, although appearing creative and original to others is extremely important to them. In the field of literature they become adept at churning out fairly technically proficient pastiche and barely disguised fan-fiction, while they can look convincingly creative to people less intelligent than them. 3. They are very, very aware of the small gap in intellect that exists between themselves and the mean, and this is a significant part of their identity, and they react viciously to any attacks on it. Try to attack credentialism or the university system’s farcical monopoly of all gainful intellectual employment in front of one of these people and witness their reaction. Better yet, just question their intelligence. 4. They have a tendency to worship at the altar of intellectual authority. The idea of an ‘expert’ appeals immensely to these people. They find someone who they consider to be highly intelligent and then delegate all their thinking to that person. This comes with the tendency to wield the wiffle bat of the appeal to authority at every opportunity. 5. Consensus reality as dictated by experts is something they feel compelled to defend. They are frequently people of the system, for the system and in defense of the system. Ironically they tend to see themselves as rugged skeptics when they are incapable of interrogating anything fed to them from the intellectual mainstream. 6. They have no concept of the limits of intellect, or a sense of intellectual humility. Intelligence recognizes that whatever it does know is eclipsed by what it doesn’t know, which leads to both humility and open mindedness. Midwittery tends to focus exclusively on what it knows, and believes that this imparts expertise and authority in unrelated fields (witness Dawkins). 7. They cannot accept anecdotes, people that violate their implicit “rules” about the kind of journey that is required for mature mastery of a demanding field. But the fact of such extraordinary accomplishments must not be denied. It doesn’t alienate them from most others though because of the rarity of the profoundly gifted. I’d bet that as much as academia would tend to exclude these people, they’re also unlikely to have an interest in being part of academia. Intelligent people want to have intellectual engagement with people of similar intelligence to themselves, and they’re unlikely to find that in the dusty cloisters of academia. Being away from that kind of group environment also allows for unencumbered creativity. Occupation can have a kind of socialization process that 95% of people in the human population cannot resist. People who work very hard and spend years in order to climb to what they regard as the pinnacle of achievement actively resent those who can simply leap up to the peak. And because their knowledge is hard won, they tend to cling to it much more tenaciously than the more intelligent individual who is no more tied to one piece of information than the next. What makes it worse is that they cannot fathom that the more intelligent individuals do not think like they do. In [LINKED_TEXT: A Parable of Talents] [URL: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/], Scott Alexander wrote: IQ is so important for intellectual pursuits that eminent scientists in some fields have average IQs around 150 to 160. Since IQ this high only appears in 1/10,000 people or so, it beggars coincidence to believe this represents anything but a very strong filter for IQ (or something correlated with it) in reaching that level. If you saw a group of dozens of people who were 7’0 tall on average, you’d assume it was a basketball team or some other group selected for height, not a bunch of botanists who were all very tall by coincidence.

Abortion is a highly disputed issue among libertarians. Makes sense too: libertarians are deeply concerned with rights. The question among libertarians is: when do rights begin? Conception? Birth? Somewhere in between? —Somewhere after birth, sometimes people philosophize? This is a really hard, value-based edge question without objective answer. The boundaries of rights are fuzzy. And libertarians can easily disagree. For example, I’m generally against abortion. In theory. But it’s really none of my business. I can’t have an abortion. On the other hand, I do not support laws which try to regulate it and prevent it. Regardless of what I think is “good”, I have no right or interest to use force and coercion (or ask the State to do it on my behalf) to stop anyone from seeking an abortion. I believe in other people’s rights to choose. —Other libertarians would say, “So long as those choices don’t hurt other people!” And so we begin another round: “Is a fetus a person which holds rights?” I say no. But others might disagree. Years ago, I had an office that overlooked a Planned Parenthood clinic across the street. There would very often be several protesters out there, walking up and down the sidewalk for most of the day. I don’t think they ever convinced anyone to leave. Sometimes, I would do the mental math: 8 protesters, times 6 hours per day, times 15 per hour… yields about 3,600 per week. If they valued life, how many children could they subsidize with their wasted time? How many young mothers’ lives would be made easier? Just things to think about…"},{"prompt":"What should I consider when selecting a petfriendly HVAC system for my home?","completion":"Choosing a pet-friendly HVAC system is an important decision to ensure the comfort and well-being of both you and your furry friends. When selecting an HVAC system, there are several factors to consider that will cater to the needs of your pets. First and foremost, it's crucial to choose an HVAC system with efficient air filtration. Pets can shed hair and dander, which can circulate in the air and trigger allergies or respiratory issues. Look for HVAC systems with high-quality filters that can capture pet allergens effectively. Another consideration is the noise level of the HVAC system. Some pets may be sensitive to loud noises, so opting for a system with quieter operation can help keep them calm and reduce stress. Temperature control is also essential. Pets are sensitive to extreme temperatures, so selecting an HVAC system that provides precise temperature regulation will help maintain a comfortable environment for your furry friends. Energy efficiency is another factor to keep in mind. Energy-efficient HVAC systems not only save you money on your utility bills but also minimize your carbon footprint. Look for systems with high energy efficiency ratings to ensure you're being environmentally conscious. For more detailed information and expert advice on selecting a pet-friendly HVAC system, I recommend checking out the Quora post at [LINKED_TEXT: How to Choose a Pet-Friendly HVAC System] [URL: https://homeimprovementandmaintenanceresourcehub.quora.com/How-to-Choose-a-Pet-Friendly-HVAC-System?ch=10&oid=109737166&share=4b782aed&srid=hE7bzb&target_type=post]."},{"prompt":"Should we use “audience was/were” clapping?","completion":"Audience is a countable noun..

I don’t enjoy being tricked by shiny things. I see right through it. You won’t get to experience as many games allowing yourself to be sucked into the same one for 6+ months (that’s a minimum- I know of some people devoting their life to the same ONE game for years, as it is so vast/endless updates) that demands to take over your life. It was cool at first, but now we see it, we know. I just don’t find them that impressive. Just endlessly large and involved, resulting in many sleepless nights for its production team, all for money more than ever before. Many updates to the game, adding new achievements to unlock by way of addictive tedium. Do they want people to enjoy the game or get sucked in and get addicted? Oh look at how real that grass looks. It’s just not important. It can be fun to be immersed in a game that takes a long time and that yes, is at times tedious as it can be a lot of fun… but I feel newer large open world games take this to a new level. You don’t even realize how much time goes by with such little that you’ve actually done.

It's simple… Have you ever seen a bulb glowing when there is a low power supply? It gets dim and bright.. right? The antennas function in the same way. The fields which are invisible to us get intensified gradually and intensity decreases gradually around the antenna. This forms kind of concentric circles of fields around the antennas(assuming isotropic antennas). Now, whenever the receiving antenna comes under the influence of this antenna, the required data is transferred depending upon the frequency at which the intensities are changing and the type of encoding. The first picture depicts fields propagating. The second picture depicts the pattern of the field.

However, one technological advancement that has had a significant impact on society is the Internet. The internet revolutionized communication and access to information on a global scale. It has enabled the creation of websites, which are essential for businesses, organizations, and individuals to establish an online presence and share information with a wide audience. To build a website, you typically need a combination of technologies, including programming languages, web development frameworks, and content management systems (CMS). Some popular programming languages for web development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and Laravel provide tools and libraries to streamline the development process. Additionally, CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla offer user-friendly interfaces and pre-built functionalities, making it easier for non-technical users to create and manage websites.

One thing you learn early, don’t ever, ever open the refrigerator. The smell can be staggering. My old job used to share a building with the city morgue. Even on the third floor you could smell when they brought in a body pulled out of the river. The morgue also had a “decomp freezer” to store bodies that were really bad. Bodies going in and out of this freezer were memorable. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Delaware Museum of Natural History’s “skeletonization” room. It had plastic tubs with rotting animal carcasses (deer, etc.) covered with Carrion Beetles, turning the rotting corpses into skeletons. The tubs were only covered with screens to keep the beetles in. Truly a foul experience. I inspected a vacant office building in Washington DC that had a homeless girl living in it. Every day or so she went to the floor above the one she lived on and shit on the concrete slab. Every single day she moved over about 18″ and left another steaming pile. Almost the entire floor was covered with a near-perfect grid of human excrement. Memorable.

For one thing there is word of mouth!! Bad news travels fast and in most cases the restaurants in the best locations have the highest prices and the worst paid staff. I eventually use something called the senses. Looking around at a number of eateries, is there rubbish or trash strewn everywhere or is it reasonably clean? Now how about who is in there already, my usual trick is to see if there are any locals eating there. Some establishments have to rely a great deal on repeat trade from workers of all sorts nearby so their reputation is vital to them rather than the money they can spend on a big sign. My choice is to avoid particularly such places that are only branches of a multi national, why bother going abroad and eating almost exactly the same as one might get at home? FWIW, I contribute occasionally to Trip Advisor and this can be quite useful for finding some nice little places off the beaten track. But there always seem to be a few reviews that are totally opposite of my experience in these places.

It should be concise and relevant to the page's content, and it should include the target keyword or phrase that you want the page to rank for. Content: The content of a web page is the most important on-page SEO factor. It should be high-quality, informative, and relevant to the target keyword or phrase. The content should also be well-written and easy to read. Meta descriptions: The meta description is the short blurb of text that appears below the title tag in search engine results. It should be concise and informative, and it should summarize the page's content. Keyword usage: Keyword usage is important for on-page SEO, but it's important to use keywords in a natural way. Keyword stuffing, or using keywords too often, can actually hurt your rankings. Internal links: Internal links are links from one page on your website to another page. They can help search engines crawl and index your website more effectively, and they can also help users navigate your website more easily. Images: Images can also be optimized for on-page SEO. They should have descriptive alt text that includes the target keyword or phrase. On-page SEO is an important part of any SEO strategy.

SPEED: I’ll start with speed first cause speed is one of the most important thing in this battle. In terms of speed Tobirama was able to outspeed KCM Minato. He basically comes out of nowhere, grabs the truth seeking orb before Minato could (even tho Minato was closer) and teleports it back to Juubito and blows him up. Now you can definitely make the argument that Minato was mentally nerfed or dazed but Minato even with that same “daze” was able to outspeed MKCM Naruto and EMS sasuke so bad that they don’t even realize until he appeared in front of them. The same EMS Sasuke who was stated to be equel to Itachi. Speed scaling: Tobirama>Dazed Kcm Minato>Ems Sasuke=Itachi Tobirama can literally speedblitz Itachi before Itachi can even blink in theory. (There are also other speed scaling for Tobirama but I’ll stick with this one) Now speed is not the only thing right? Attack potency plays a huge part cause Tobirama can be faster but he cannot damage Itachi if he doesn’t have the AP. So now let’s talk about AP. If we’re using Edo Tobirama then he has a jutsu called the tandem paper bomb technique. This is an ancillary jutsu for the edo tensei that he did not get to use against the Gold and Silver brothers. Tobirama’s tandem paper bomb technique was able to annihilate Hashirama’s largest and strongest deity gate. As a reminder a weaker version of these deity gates were able to pin down the Juubi and can also tank the Juubi’s explosions. Without his paper bombs, 1 Rinnegan Sage Mode Madara absolutely refuses to let tobirama to touch him at all, even resorting to the Susanoo to defend himself😭💀. He also has a jutsu called the “Fresh water blade” which is implied to have either durability negation or high levels of AP. So Tobirama has the speed to beat up Itachi, he has the AP to damage Itachi and overall Tobirama just stomps. Itachi fans I’m sorry ok.

We have a bunch of different frameworks/tools that managers expect a person to magically be a master at. If they don't know they will ASSUME you are a bad developer. A person has to either be using the tools since they were a child or be a toxically obsessed in learning new software tools if they want to master said tools. Just to make t clear I'll bullet down why it's hard: Learning each tool/programming language: is hardSpending time to make projects so you can CONVINCE them you can do the job: is hardHaving social work experience to show you can handle a software team’s passive aggressive tone: is hard (for example working at fast food).Being able to stay calm when they ask stupid questions that most computer science majors are required to know by graduation: is hard. For real, you can fail an interview just because you failed to provide a clear definition of Object Oriented programming. All my projects use OOP, but stutter once, and watch them lose faith in you on the spot. OOP is an intro CS topic required for one's entire CS curriculum, wtf is it even a question?! Maybe they are entered industry at a time where it wasn't a big deal but I don't know.To make it worst the reason why potential employers are so choosy is because there exists bad developers, like REALLY bad developers that somehow got a job. You ask yourself how they even graduated when they barely know how to program. Basically interviewers are really really scared, literally SCARED they are gonna hire a bad developer, making them super choosy.Lack of social skills. I don't mean to be rude or discriminatory, but I feel, I FEEL, that a lot of developers lack proper social skills. This plays a role with their ability to seek out good candidates. They have don't enough insight on how to talk to a person to know if they can make a good developer.Passive aggressiveness. Again, industry is toxic. Sometimes I feel like maybe one of my colleagues is trying to sabotage me and make me look bad. If they feel you are not doing enough good work you can hear it in their voice.Its high in demand because it's hard to learn, it's hard to get a job because industry is toxic. I will only recommend this field if one really values income and NEED that income. I'm greatful for having the job. However, I wish the environment was healthier."},{"prompt":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","completion":"There are many great science fiction novels that have captured readers' imaginations over the years.

Really. I wore them a lot in their earlier incarnation. They fit really well, and I loved them. As they wore out, I patched them, and patched them some more. They were a rainbow of fabric and lace and leather and embroidery. My friend J loved my jeans. He always admired me in them, and noticed when a new patch was added. He even contributed some lovely fabric bits. When I was done wearing those jeans, I created another life for them: I made them into a sculpture. I hung them from a post in the shop where I worked, and filled them with expanding foam (urea formaldehyde, maybe? I don’t actually remember.) The foam completely filled them, and held the folds in the fabric perfectly. I left the button undone and the zipper open a little, just because. And then I painted them with clear resin. I did several coats, so they’d be really sturdy. To finish my piece, I poured acetone into them, which dissolved the foam. Et, voila! A standing-up pair of awesome jeans. I gave them to J for a house-warming gift. He was really happy, and made everyone who came over take a look. I was thrilled that he liked them so much. I wasn’t sure if it was just too freakish or not. It wasn’t. J has been gone a long time, lost to AIDS. His beloved kept the jeans, and although we have lost touch, I like to think my sculpture is still out there somewhere."},{"prompt":"Why do people vape?","completion":"People vape because they are immateur and foolish.

There are many ways to monetize a blog, including advertising, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, and selling products or services. The amount of income a blog generates will depend on the effectiveness of the monetization strategies used and the amount of traffic the blog receives.

Animal sacrifices were an element of India's old Vedic religion, according to books like the Yajurveda. Bali is a Sanskrit phrase for animal sacrifice that means \\"tribute, offering, or oblation\\" in general. Bali is sometimes referred to as Jhatka Bali among Hindus, and \\"refers to the blood of an animal. The Ashvamedha, a Vedic ceremony in which a horse was permitted to ride freely for a year before being sacrificed, is recorded in the Yajurveda. Yudhishtra, the Chakravartin emperor, performs the Ashwamedha after winning the Kurukshetra war in the epic Mahabharata.There is also a narrative of an Ashvamedha conducted by the Chedi king Uparichara Vasu in the Mahabharata, but no animals were killed in this storey.Sacrifices, on the other hand, were common in this ceremony.

There are only two ways to do this. 1. Elimination of the second amendment by a constitutional amendment. Taking away the second amendment is a function of political mathematics. A constitutional amendment requires a super majority of 2/3rds of both chambers of congress and a 2/3rds majority of states to ratify it. These measures to limit the second amendment or criticizing it’s supporters are posted because those posting them know that they are nowhere close to having the votes to take completely take away the second amendment, in fact the political math is in fact working against taking away the second amendment. There are now more states that allow concealed carry than ever before, more than half of the states now allow concealed carry without a permit, they are obviously pro second amendment. A two thirds majority of states 34 would be needed to ratify a repeal of the second amendment, in other words only 16 could oppose it. 2. Use the political organs of the state (The Federal Government) justified with state propaganda (leftwing controlled mainstream media) to ignore and de-facto overturn the US Constitution, eliminate the supporters of the second amendment, thereby establishing one party rule in the newly formed “People’s Republic of the United States”.

So, we were all having lunch and were sitting around a table. During the conversation one of the Kannadigas started speaking in Telugu with the Telugu people, many of the locals in my company are multilingual and make people feel comfortable by speaking their language. Now, one of the North Indians sitting near them protested saying that people should speak “normal” languages only otherwise how will other people understand. Now, I have sooooooo many problems with this statement. on what basis can we call Telugu as an “abnormal” language? Shouldn’t it also be spoken? Same way how Marathi people make Hindustani people feel at home in Maharashtra so too do Kannadigas make Telugu people feel at home in Karnataka. How can you say one is normal and other should not be socially acceptable?Do Hindustani people follow the same rule? Will they switch to English if in a given context Hindi is not qualified as a “normal” language? I know the answer to this question and so does everyone else. There is no point in repeating a point which has been made ad nauseam.Isn’t this convenient for Hindustani people? Their language is considered as “normal”. So, basically, they never have to learn a language outside of school, never have to learn how hard it is to learn a language. Later on some of the same people will insult and laugh at people who try to speak in Hindi to try to be one with them. The problem with this language being the unifying language is that some North Indians, to use American language, blissfully bask in their North Indian privilege never even realising that other people adjust and speak to them in Hindi at every turn.

This includes updating on-page content, title tags, internal links, and more .Search engines like Google look at keywords and other on-page SEO cues to check whether a page matches a user’s search intent. And if the search engine decides the page will be useful to the user, it will display it higher in search results. Keyword optimization: Conduct keyword research to identify relevant and high-value keywords that your target audience is searching for. Incorporate these keywords naturally into the page's title tag, headings, meta description, URL, and throughout the content. High-quality content: Create unique, informative, and engaging content that satisfies the user's search intent. Ensure the content is well-structured, properly formatted with headings, and contains relevant keywords naturally. Use descriptive and enticing meta descriptions to improve click-through rates from search results. Title tags: Craft compelling and descriptive title tags that accurately summarize the content of the page. Include relevant keywords and keep the title tag within the recommended length limit (around 50-60 characters) to ensure it is fully displayed in search results. Meta descriptions: Write concise and persuasive meta descriptions that provide a preview of the page's content. Although meta descriptions do not directly impact rankings, they can influence click-through rates. Include relevant keywords and maintain a length of around 150-160 characters. URL structure: Use descriptive and SEO-friendly URLs that clearly indicate the page's content. Include relevant keywords in the URL, separate words with hyphens, and keep it concise and meaningful. Header tags (H1, H2, etc.): Use header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure your content and signal the importance of different sections. Include relevant keywords in your headings to provide search engines with an understanding of the page's content hierarchy. Image optimization: Optimize images by compressing their file size without compromising quality. Use descriptive filenames and alt text to provide search engines with context about the image content. This helps improve accessibility and can contribute to image search rankings.

What are your views about court restrictions this year?","completion":"I have not burst crackers since 1997 when my sons grew up. However i find that it is none of the Supremes Courts Business who bursts crackers and who does not. The SC is nobody to tell anyone to stop bursting crackers. They have gone too far with their insane orders since 2015. The SC are not democratically elected by the people. They are a bunch of judges who have zero idea of culture and traditions of different people. It is the politicians and the elected representatives who should make the decision to outlaw the production of crackers NOT THE SUPREME COURT. First of all this PIL business has to stop. SC entertains insane PILS - and actually pass ridiculous orders - like cracker bursting, cracker sales etc when it is not their job or their business. If Delhi has pollution - it is the State Government and Central Governments Job to see that the pollution is handled. If they outlaw crackers - that is their decision since they have been elected to power by the common man and if common man feels that this decision is bad - he will express his anger through the vote at the next election . That is how democracy works. Yet the SC judges are selected by a random collegium who have zero business with common man - so in reality the SC decision looks like decisions of a dictator as there are no checks and balances on their insanity. For instance - if PM Modi makes a decision like demonetization and people are unhappy - they vote BJP out of power, but how can the people handle the SC? Who handles the SC? Nobody. IN the past the SC handled the power well - Judges like Lodha or Katju knew their powers and responsibility and their decisions were hugely respected. Their decision to outlaw sunfilm was so beautifully implemented throughout the country yet - the newer breed of SC judges like Thakur, Mishra or Gogoi have trounced on this respect with some extremely atrocious decisions like Jallikattu, Sabarimala or Crackers because of which people are actually openly defying the orders. In my neighborhood children burst crackers from 6 PM - 11 PM and cops comfortably travelling on the road did not spend a second in reprimanding them or telling them to stop. They stopped at 11 PM. So - to summarize- only the democratically elected government can make such decisions since there are checks and balances and decisions can always be judged by their performance in thenext elections. Likewise another horror is Rafale where a desperate has been loser Mr Shourie creates mischief and the current king of losers Rahul gandhi creates a ruckus and suddenly rather than throwing out the entire issue - the illustrious bench of the SC compromises our air force and defence by handling this insanity.

Were they really? Or did Marvel just do a great job of retconning everything at the right moments to make it seem like there was a plan that never actually existed? Actually the latter is the real truth. There was never a master plan. The Tesseract and Loki's staff were retroactively turned into Infinity Stones, Thanos was added at the end of the first Avengers film at the last minute before release simply because Joss Wheedon loves the character, to everyone, including Kevin Feige, the sudden appearance of Thanos in the story was a huge surprise, at the time no one had any idea of the last minute inclusion of Thanos, this became a moment of crisis “what the hell are we going to do with THIS?” There was so little planning that they actually included the Infinity Gauntlet in the background in the first Thor movie as an Easter egg for the hard core fans, the reasoning being “there is no possible way we are ever going to actually do the Infinity Gauntlet story so let's just toss this in the background for fun.”. Little did they know that only a few short years later, that simple two second Easter egg would become a major crisis and necessitate a major retcon in Thor Ragnarok. This never would have been necessary if they had a plan from the beginning. In addition, several of the post credits scenes were never really paid off, or were quickly cast aside in the sequel without being addressed. The end credits scene in The Incredible Hulk was actually retconned away by a Marvel one shot a couple years later. And it is difficult not to notice the repeated back and forth on whether Iron Man would be a member of the Avengers or not. Iron Man 1 has Fury approaching Stark, then The Incredible Hulk has Stark fully on board trying to recruit other members for the team only for us to be told in Iron Man 2! that Natasha has been sent to see if Stark is good enough for the team that he was supposedly already recruited for at the end of the first movie. If SHIELD is still evaluating him, why did Fury approach Stark in the first place? Similarly, if Loki's staff is an Infinity Stone, why did Thanos give it up to get a different stone if his plan all along was to collect all 6? If you're honest, you'll have to admit that none of this makes a lick of sense, it only seems otherwise because Marvel has a gift for well timed retcons to try to make incoherent stories seem to make sense retroactively, provided you don't examine the details too closely"},{"prompt":"Where do you find the crowd for crowdfunding campaigns?","completion":"Crowdfunding campaigns are fundraising efforts that are typically conducted online and involve a large number of people contributing small amounts of money to support a particular project, product, or cause.

I got the real backstory only very recently and here is it: A Taiwanese model who featured in a cosmetic surgery advert in 2012, for a clinic and ad agency was left in misery, with her career coming to a standstill after the ad became a popular internet meme. If you remember any version of the meme, it had this same caption in different languages: “Plastic surgery - you can't hide it forever.\\" Her ordeal began in 2012 with a photo shoot for an advertisement aimed at convincing people to get plastic surgery at a Taiwanese cosmetic clinic. The photo showed very attractive \\"parents\\" with sought-after big eyes and long, well-defined noses, and their three \\"children\\", whose images were altered to make their eyes look exceptionally small and their noses flat. The caption read: \\"The only thing you'll ever have to worry about is how to explain it to the kids.\\" Ms Yeh stated that her contract, signed by her agency and the Taipei office of US-based international advertising agency J Walter Thompson (JWT), was clear that the ad would be used in newspapers and magazines, by that clinic only. But JWT later allowed another plastic surgery clinic, Simple Beauty, to use it on its website; it also put the image on JWT's Facebook page. Before long, the photo made its way across the internet, with a new caption: \\"Plastic surgery - you can't hide it forever.\\" Then in 2012, a Chinese tabloid attached it to a fake story - which [LINKED_TEXT: first emerged in 2004] [URL: http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/95896.htm] - about a husband from Heilongjiang who sued his wife when he found out she had plastic surgery before they met, because their children grew up to look nothing like her. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #tVzgj] The whole world was spreading it and in different languages. People actually thought it was real. Even her then-boyfriend's friends would ask about it. She began to get smaller roles in advertisements because her clients were asking her if she was the person in the meme. The picture however remained on the companys’ websites and was only removed after she held a press conference where she threatened to sue them.

Cardano's method is a formula for finding the roots of a cubic equation. The general form of a cubic equation is: ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 To solve this equation using Cardano's method, we need to transform it into a simpler form: x³ + px + q = 0 where p and q are constants. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get: x³ - (3/4)x - (1/8) = 0 Next, we need to find the values of p and q. We can do this by using the following formulas: p = (3ac - b²) / 3a² q = (2b³ - 9abc + 27a²d) / 27a³ where a, b, c, and d are the coefficients of the cubic equation. Substituting the values, we get: a = 1, b = 0, c = -3/4, and d = -1/8 p = (3 x 1 x (-3/4) - 0²) / (3 x 1²) = -1/2 q = (2 x 0³ - 9 x 1 x (-3/4) x (-1/8) + 27 x 1² x (-1/8)) / 27 = -1/64 Now we need to use Cardano's formula to find the roots of the equation: x = (u + v) - b / 3a where u = (q + √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3) v = (q - √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3) Substituting the values, we get: u = (-1/64 + √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3) Simplifying the expressions, we get: u = (-1/64 + √(13/1728))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √(13/1728))^(1/3) u ≈ 0.5874 v ≈ -1.1748 Substituting these values into the formula for x, we get: x1 = u + v ≈ -0.4173 x2 = -(u + v)/2 + i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 = -(u + v)/2 - i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i Therefore, the solutions of the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 are approximately: x1 ≈ -0.4173 x2 ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i Note that the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so x2 and x3 are complex conjugates of each other"},{"prompt":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","completion":"Well, sort of.

I don’t believe that dogs have the capacity to connect past actions to consequences, so I normally would never scold a dog if I found poop in the basement. He knows that poop upsets me but doesn’t remember doing it himself.

It’s the only time I’ve ever seen a dog cry. Bad me."},{"prompt":"their prime, who was a better rock group, The Stones or The Who?","completion":"It’s a fair question. IMO … the 1969–74 era is the period you want to look at - the heyday of both bands. The Stones: In the 1969–74 period, right as the ‘rock world’ was moving into a strongly virtuoistic-player era … The Rolling Stones were ‘right there’ in the forefront with the addition of the great ‘British Bluesman’ Mick Taylor. I saw them twice in this period … and their live performance was stirring and wonderfully musical as well - top notch (even though Jagger has never been accused of being a good singer, or even a guy who carries a tune all that well - he goes flat a lot in the higher register). In the Mick Taylor years, the Stones put out IMO their best albums. 1969: the live Get Yer Ya Ya’s Out (Platinum, Best songs: Jumpin Jack Flash, Street Fighting Man)1969: Let It Bleed (2X Platinum) Best songs: Gimme Shelter, Let It Bleed, You Can't Always Get What You Want1971: my favorte Stones album, the great Sticky Fingers (4X Platinum) Best songs: pretty much all of them - Brown Sugar, Sway, Wild Horses, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Bitch, Sister Morphine, Dead Flowers, Moonlight Mile1972: Exlie on Main Street (Platinum) Best songs: Tumbling Dice, Happy, All Down The Line1973: Goat's Head Soup (4X Platinum) Best song: Angie1974: It's Only Rock and Roll (Platinum) Best song: the title track Additionally Mick Taylor crafted a new lead solo riff for 1968's “Steet Fighting Man” that helped make the '69 Git Your Ya Ya's Out tour a huge success. Did You Know? Mick Taylor came to the Stones from the iconic British blues band, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. (Do you know how he got into the Bluesbreakers? In 1965, at age 16, Taylor went to see The Bluesbreakers performance at \\"The Hop,” Welwyn Garden City. And for some reason, their guitarist, some guy named Eric Clapton, was a no-show. After a song or two, seeing that Clapton hadn't appeared, but that his guitar was up there, all set up, on the stage, Taylor approached John Mayall during the break to ask if he could play with them. Taylor mentioned that he was familiar with the band's repertoire, and after a moment of deliberation, Mayall said okay. Taylor later said, \\"I wasn't thinking that this was a great opportunity ...\\" This encounter, however, proved to be pivotal in Taylor's career when Mayall, a year later, needed someone to replace Clapton’s successor-guitarist in the band, Peter Green, when Green quit to form Fleetwood Mac. Mayall placed a 'Guitarist Wanted' advert in the weekly Melody Maker music paper, and — to his great relief, Mayall later said, Taylor showed up for a tryout … none was necessary. So spring ‘67, he became a Bluesbreaker) (All Down The Line, live in 1972) ============== The Who In the 1969–73 period, they put out just three albums, but what albums they were: 1969: the great Tommy (2X Platinum. Best songs: all of them ... all great songs except “Uncle Ernie”) 1070: the great Live at Leeds (2X Platinum) Best Songs: Substitiute, Summer Time Blues, My Generation, Magic Bus. 1971: Who’s Next (3X Platinum. Best songs: Baba O'Riley, Bargain, The Song Is Over, Going Mobile, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again) 1973: Quadrophenia (Platinum. Best Song: Love, Reign o’er Me) =============== So, who was better? I saw them both in this period, in 1969. The Who concert (in a small venue in Detroit, about 1500 or so) was probably the best concert I’ve ever seen - they played the whole Tommy album, then “My Generation” for an encore. Pete Townshend sounding like two guitars at once, playing lead and rhythm at the same time. John Entwistle - similarly, sounding like two, playing chords on the bass. Keith Moon - sounding like three. The 6–7 Pete Townshend doing his windmills and leaps. Roger Daltrey tossing the microphone around. The Stones, Olympia Stadium, Detroit. The Get Yer Ya Ya’s Out tour. Mick Jagger is the consumate showman. And with the wonderful Mick Taylor up there, the Stones were a virtuosic band as well. Their new version of “Street FIghting Man” with Taylor’s guitar playing was something special. And Jumping Jack Flash - Mick in his Uncle Sam top had, and scarf, was unforgettable. To me, both were magnificant live … the quality of Pete Townshend’s songwriting talent is what stands out more to me, however. Jagger/Richards is an elite songwriting team … but Townshend was/is something special in that regard, IMO. His songs were beautiful, so the live performances were highly musical as well as exciting and dramatic. I give it by a slim margin to … The Who.

The feed will be the ocean and sewerage. In the long term the administration can reduce water supply losses (during transporting to customer) to less then 10% instead of being near 50% right now, right there water available to customer goes up by a solid 100%.Put a cost of water per 1000 ltr. which will be charged with respect to the income of every household, this is important to fund water for those who have no money, and to teach people to learn to respect water.Make a water plan which increases water reservoirs and does actual watershed management in and near Chennai area. I am sure that proposals for all of the above are pending with the administration, and they can also get the money from the state and central government. The people have to wake up the politicians and administrators through mass agitation, and make it clear that till the water problem is not solved, nothing will move in Chennai and nearby areas, only such actions move them, otherwise they will wait for the monsoons and leave the problem for next year. All the technology and technical expertise to solve every aspect of this problem exists, and its not a complicated solution which can not be implemented, neither is the solution prohibitively expensive."},{"prompt":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","completion":"A business analyst is someone who looks at the various parts of a company as well as its competitors and then provides reports and presentations outlining possible ways to improve performance. This can include preparing sales forecasts to decide how to organize employees better to increase efficiency. All a business analyst needs is an in-depth knowledge of the subject, excellent problem-solving skills, management experience, and the ability to communicate his or her ideas persuasively. There are no strict educational requirements for those looking into this career path, though a background in accounting or law may be helpful depending on the position within an organization that is sought out. Responsibilities of Business Analyst: As a business analyst, one might have to make presentations to senior managers as well as the board of directors.Good public speaking skills are thus a must.A person in this position also needs to be able to think on his or her feet and quickly come up with problem-solving strategies.This comes especially in handy when working for fast-paced companies that need to constantly keep a close eye on the competition, such as information technology firms and large retail chains. Business analysts may work individually or within teams depending on the company's needs. They may even have the opportunity to go overseas when conducting their research, especially if they are working for multinational businesses. To become a business analyst, one must generally have a working knowledge of the subject in question, though that is not always the case. Business analysts are often hired from within organizations that desire an expert on their subject lines. Online resources for BA: Many online institutes provide the best BA courses. Some of the top platforms are: Simplilearn - Business Analytics Simplilearn offers a comprehensive Business Analytics Course for students who wish to add Business Analytics to their existing IT skillset.

Advanced-Data Science and ML course at Learnbay is one of a kind. The best part about Learnbay DS courses is their domain-specialized courses. There is a rise in demand for domain-specialized courses nowadays. Importance of domain-specialized courses: I would strongly advise a working professional to pursue domain-specific training. It is critical because you will be able to master data or business analytics in your chosen career field and develop your career as a result. Specialization in a specific domain, in my opinion, is the most effective way to enhance your career. This type of training not only allows you to develop in your career but also allows you to get experience in a specific field. Employers in high-profile professions nowadays seek applicants that have a focus on domain specialization and have specific competence in their fields. Learnbay's Advanced Data Science and AI Program, which includes a domain specialization option, is ideal for working professionals. This feature is not accessible on other platforms. While studying AI or DS, you can focus on a certain field such as sales, banking, finance, or oil and gas. Conclusion: The role of the Business Analyst is to aid other departments within an organization where they find that planning and analyzing requirements, extracting information from data, and extending or modifying products are very important in completing projects. Learnbay will offer you a unique learning experience, where you will learn programming languages, as well as the concepts behind them. This includes the process of reading and writing code.

Is it really profitable?","completion":"Dropshipping is an online business model of selling products without stock. You delegate the storage and logistics duties to the supplier, while you only create a store and attract customers – the model works like that. That’s why your online store is not tied to the warehouse. This is one of the advantages of the dropshipping business model. You don’t need a huge warehouse where products will be stored, and the supplier does most of the job for you: inventory issues, stocking and shipping are not your concern! It turns out that to open a store and start selling, you do not need any production facility or warehouse. All questions of logistics and storage of goods are solved by the supplier, your task is to attract customers and provide them with the opportunity to pay on the website. Of course, for many people, this business model is profitable. They put their energy, time and money there. But dropshipping (like any other business) is not a business for everyone. Before you think about creating your own dropshipping store, it is worth to study the principles of this business model and decide for yourself whether you want/ can do it or not.

Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves to generate heat, which cooks food quickly and efficiently. There is a common misconception that microwave cooking negatively affects the nutritional value of food, but this is not entirely accurate. Like any cooking method, the impact on nutritional value depends on factors such as cooking time, temperature, and the type of food being prepared. Overcooking or excessive heating can lead to nutrient loss in any cooking process, including microwave cooking. However, when used properly, microwave ovens can help retain the nutrients in food. Microwaves cook food by generating heat directly within the food itself, rather than through the heating elements or hot air in conventional ovens. This shorter cooking time and the limited use of water helps to minimize nutrient loss, as some vitamins and minerals are sensitive to heat and water-soluble. To preserve the nutritional value while using a microwave oven, consider the following tips: Use microwave-safe containers: Ensure the containers used are microwave-safe to prevent harmful chemicals from leaching into the food.Minimize water usage: Steaming or microwaving foods with minimal or no added water helps retain their nutritional content.Cook in small portions: Cooking smaller portions allows for more even heating and reduces the risk of overcooking.Avoid overcooking: Use the appropriate cooking time and power level to avoid overcooking and nutrient loss. Check the food regularly to prevent overheating.Preserve texture and color: Microwaving foods for a shorter duration can help retain their texture, color, and overall quality.Prioritize balanced meals: Focus on incorporating a variety of fresh, whole foods into your meals to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet. It's important to note that microwaving food in microwave-safe containers, following proper cooking techniques, and maintaining a varied diet are all crucial for overall health and nutrition.

People donate recyclables in bulk all the time, and it’s probably the easiest, most eco-friendly way to separate yourself from them discreetly. Don’t offer up an explanation if nobody asks. To offer any sort of excuse implying you didn’t drink them all yourself is just inviting that very assumption. (Same goes when you buy it. Non-problem drinkers will plunk it on the counter; problem drinkers will volunteer that they’re “hosting a dinner party” or “having friends over” to the clerk ringing up their wine purchase.) If you only have a few, throw them in with your stuff (not together or they’ll clank). One in the gym bag, the other in your purse, and toss them into a public recycle bin. If you have no other choice and need to dump them in the trash, put the wine bottle into a sturdy paper bag and crush it with a hammer or rolling pin or rock. Then roll it up tight and stuff it in there, making sure the glass shards can’t easily escape. If it’s in the form of crushed glass, it’s not easily identifiable as a wine bottle.

That's why Ait station is junction. The Ait-Konch Shuttle is a train that runs with just 3 coaches and covers a distance of 13.68 kilometres in 35 minutes, at a sluggish pace of 30 Kilometers per hour. Sounds interesting? What is more interesting is the history behind this. Konch and Ait are two tiny towns in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and comes under the Jalaun district.The crumbling 15 km road ride from Konch to Ait is a daunting one for bones, young and old. Tempos charge Rs 20 for each passenger and arrive at the destination in one hour.*The train made its first run around 1901-1903, even before the Railway Board was constituted in 1905.*Introduced by British, the shuttle was meant to ferry goods and passengers as Konch was a big market for cotton, forest produce, and ghee. The cotton was sent to Manchester for weaving.When the government decided to discontinue its services in 1997, thousands squatted on the railway line in protest. The railways tried to reason with them and a Rail Bus was sent to Konch to replace the shuttle. But the shuttle remained the locals’ first and only choice.Three months later, the train was back on track.There is no halt on the way but a passenger can flag it down with a wave, or request the guard to let him alight when his village nears.

I’m not sure that Quora actually constitutes social media, per se, but it’s somewhat ‘moreish’ to me? Odd really, because Quora seems to bridge a strange gap in people’s lives! Unlike certain other social media sites, there is no inferred ‘snooping policy’ by the individual - I simply don’t care what someone has had for tea or, indeed, what they’ve been up to for the past 20 years - if someone hasn’t heard from me for 20 years, there’s a reason - for them and for me? However, the odd thing is that I seem to have made some friends because of Quora? Admittedly, these are ‘cyber-friends’, but I simply don’t care? Such people make me think, make me laugh and make me weep - but it’s good to ‘belong’! I consider myself to be considerably more ‘well rounded’ because of these wonderful people! Quora isn’t the sort of site for one to check on old friends, it’s the sort of site to make new friends! Long may it continue! Btw, it’s not for me to tell you how to run a successful business, but if maybe if you were to sell ‘Quora’ merchandise, you know the type of thing - mugs, tees, keyrings, baseball caps etc, then I think that Quora would do well out of it? Maybe, just maybe, if you were to award such items to (ahem!) ‘Top Writers’, then this would be good too?

I've never participated in a military drill, let alone an operation, so I don't have any tales worthy of a Hollywood film. Ah, well… I guess I'll just have to settle for that one incident where I was half an inch away from potentially dying. Oh, I have your attention now? Excellent. Let us begin. The story takes place in the summer of 2013, during the Officer's Training course, whose purpose is to take hungry, sleep-deprived soldiers and transform them into hungry, sleep-deprived soldiers with extra responsibilities. (Okay, it's not that bad. It's just common practice here in Israel for everyone to poke fun at the officers, including the officers themselves. Why serve more? The answer is obvious, yet we all ask it nonetheless.) Being religious, I was placed in the segregated unit from day one (“Goddammit.”), with a bunch of commanders who thought that since we were a bunch of dudes, we should go out and do macho things. That we should get our own ‘combat’ experience. So it was no surprise when they decided one day that instead of allowing us to take a (well-deserved!) break for a bit, a few lucky folks would be going out on a ‘patrol’ around the base, because, you know, it builds character. We were to split up into two teams of four, each equipped with a team leader and a dude with a walkie-talkie the size of a tank (that's me!), and thus learn to operate seamlessly as a group. (In retrospect, it wasn't that stupid of an idea, but I still found it quite amusing to think about every time I thought about it when I sat in my office, working what was unmistakably a desk job.) (I also have absolutely no recollection who the three dudes on my team were.) The first task we were given was to patrol, which made sense, considering that this was point of the exercise in the first place. This involved pretending to walk in formation, a bit of crouching, and occasionally tackling the scenarios which our commander - who was walking behind us - improvised. “You see two shadows approaching from the right. Quick - what do you do?” We immediately get into position and crouch down, while our fearless leader shouts out in the shadow’s general direction: “Stop, stop*, and identify yourself!” There was no answer, of course. Non-existent shadows can’t talk. Next up was surveillance. We were told to head to the top of a hill, spread out, lie down on our stomachs, and be prepared for the unspeakable horrors which would undoubtedly befall us. My eyebrows were raised as I lay down on the rocks, but I kept still and quiet, awaiting further orders. It was then that I felt a sharp, intense pain in my thigh. For a moment, my mind didn't register what was going on. Huh? The hell? But it didn't take me any more than a single second to catch on. Oh, crap. I quickly stood up, slightly unnerved but still feeling relatively calm, and called out: “Commander… a scorpion just got me.” My commander walked towards me, unsure if I was being serious; my friends shuffled over hesitantly, wondering if this was actually part of the drill. “A scorpion? You sure?” “Damn sure.” He took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and pointed it towards the ground. Sure enough, a bright yellow scorpion was scurrying around, circling a large rock which provided it shelter just a moment ago, a rock which I was unfortunate enough to lie directly upon. (Not the actual little bugger, but a close representation) The protocol in such a situation is simple: take a picture of the scorpion, kill it, and carry the guy who was stung away on a stretcher, pronto, and that's just what my unit did, minus the pronto part. Meanwhile, I'm feeling oddly calm about the whole situation. There's a certain serenity in knowing that the worst has already happened, and that things are no longer in your hands. (Or maybe that's just me being weird. Who cares? As long as it works.) My friends hoist me on the stretcher and we began our ten-minute trek back to base. Ever been on a stretcher before? It’s like a roller-coaster ride, with that exhilarating sensation of having your stomach drop out from under you every time you encounter a bump, except that roller-coasters are safe. Usually. Meanwhile, my commander is doing his due diligence by inquiring whether I’m feeling fine. I assure him that except for the fact that the stung area is burning like mad, I’m feeling perfectly fine and clear-headed, and that I’ll definitely let him know if I’m feeling woozy. So I’m sitting there in the stretcher, inwardly cursing every time the damn thing lurches because of my friends’ inexperience, but at the same time, I’m counting my blessings. It was fairly obvious to me what had just transpired: the sting managed to pierce the skin, hence the burning sensation, but it didn’t go in far enough for the venom to enter the bloodstream. If it was just a half-inch deeper, though… Ten minutes later, and my friends arrive at the entrance to the base, where a van is waiting to take me to the infirmary. I sit in the back seat and make myself comfortable, with my commander sitting beside me, obviously thinking about how he could get us out ‘patrolling’ again without us being attacked by potentially deadly animals. Meanwhile, the officer sitting alongside the driver decides that now would be an excellent time to discuss different types of scorpions and how venomous they are. “So, you know, it's common knowledge that yellow scorpions are far, far deadlier than the black ones. The black ones are pretty tame, you know? But those yellow ones… don't mess with the yellow ones. Nasty little buggers.” And I'm sitting there in the back of the car, with a wry, exasperated smile plastered to my face, thinking to myself: Yup, just my lucky day, eh? “The size of the scorpion, that matters too. You see, no one wants to mess with larger ones because they're so big, right? But the small ones, they need a way to survive, so they have a more potent venom to compensate…” Strike two. Bloody hell. “… and then there's the pincers, of course. Same story. If the pincers are big, no problemo. But if they're small, you can be damn sure that it's the venom packing the punch.” Three for three! Lovely. Just... lovely. We arrived at the infirmary, and there just so happened to be a doctor on the scene who was able to confirm that I’d survive the ordeal. A bit of local inflammation, yes, but there was no venom working it’s way through my body, and that with a good night’s sleep at the infirmary I should be just fine. (My friends still tell me that I should’ve pretended that I was sick and played hooky for a few days. In retrospect, I’m not sure I disagree.) So, all’s well that ends well, I guess. I felt extremely glad that no harm was done (well, except for the poor scorpion, but I wasn’t feeling so bad for him at the time), and that I was extraordinarily lucky to have escaped what could’ve been a lethal experience by a margin of half an inch… … especially when it came to my attention a few weeks later that it was highly likely that the infirmary didn’t actually have the proper antidote at the time. Gotta love the military sometimes. * The second ‘stop’ is repeated for clarity, not because we can’t formulate a proper sentence."},{"prompt":"w much longer can the Russian economy sustain its war with Ukraine?","completion":"As long as they have credit after they are out of their own money!"},{"prompt":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","completion":"look up “nando paraddo”"},{"prompt":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","completion":"1 no other number but 1 works in this equation.

And the media helped pave the way for the assault on the presidency to continue by making sure you hated him. That way, when the American sense of fair play kicked in, you would be easily able to ignore or override that impulse to take it easy on him after you’d finished bashing him like mad to begin with. No. President Trump doesn't deserve your compassion. He is teh debil. What a fine lot you Democrats are. You and the dung heap of what they pretend to be journalists in the industry.

Here is the short version: Lots of rain and mudUncontrollable pestsFrequent bombardmentsUnrelenting exhaustion The long version: Trenches were 10 feet deep or so, reinforced with sandbags and other materials. They were not straight, but were zigzagged. This was so that, in the case of an enemy intrusion, they wouldn't be mown down standing in a line. There would several trenches parallel to each other, with communication lines connecting them. There would be dugouts throughout, and various outstretches for sentry posts. The front lines were usually around 200 yards apart from each other, but sometimes as close as a few yards. The first horror to mention is the water and mud. Because many of the trenches (especially British) were dug in low-lying areas, the would hit water after just a few feet. Not only that, but the years of WWI were particularly rainy. Men would usually be up to their ankles in water and mud, not uncommon to be to their thighs, and on some occasions, as high as their necks. Trenches were constantly being re-dug and repaired from all the rain damage. Soldiers would be covered in mud from head to toe, in all orifices. Trench foot was a common ailment, sometimes resulting in amputations. Great coats would soak up the water, adding as much as 40 pounds to the overall wait. Movement in general was extremely exhausting and inhibiting. The second to mention are the pests. Rats infested the trenches in numbers of tens of millions. They were notoriously bold as well, having no second thoughts to crawl over a soldiers face while he slept. They invaded food supplies at every chance, spreading disease. Worst of all, the feasted upon the many corpses in the trenches and in No Man's Land. They were described as so big and menacing, that they would eat a wounded man if he was defenseless. Lice was another problem. Men were constantly infested with lice of all varieties. Although delousing methods were employed, they were of little use. Eggs were always dispersed among the soldier's clothes, hatching under human body heat. Much disease was spread at the feet of these vermin. Despite the horrific scenes described, there was still the whole war thing going on. Both sides were always struggling to gain an upper hand on the other. This was not a war of finesse, but of material. The result was usually massive bombardments on either side. The noise was described as particularly fearsome and hard to imagine. It was not just booms and whistles here and there, but a symphony of explosions and destruction. It was said to be so deep and powerful, that it was felt in the ears, not heard. It was almost tangible, a wall of sound you could touch. Not to mention was the close and helpless proximity to the assault. One soldier described it as being tied to a stake while someone swings a sledgehammer around. In general, soldiers were just tired. There was rarely, if ever, a comfortable place to sleep. The amount of energy required just to move down the line pained and strained the body to levels few can identify with. The strain on the nerves was also very taxing, as was the constant smell of human excrement and decomposing corpses. Apparently, men's imaginations were worn down as well. The rustling of barbed wire or shadows in the darkness were constantly instilling paranoia in soldier's minds. Overall, life in the trenches in supposedly the closest the Hell that anyone on Earth has ever gotten. Thats what they say at least.

You see, as shown in Halo 2, Master Chief is able to fit into an ODST Drop Pod. Thus my group of Spartans could easily use this tactic to negate the effectiveness of the walls, and other static barriers. I would probably equip them with battle rifles, as they will be very effective against the English longbow men. As a side arm I would definitely give them their Magnums. Though-while storming the interiors of the castle/keep, or the watch towers, I would equip them with their Caseless SMG’s, Assault Rifles, and of course-their greatly augmented strength. For personal defense I would not worry too much. Depending on the generation of Spartan, a personal energy shield would be available. Not to mention their MJOLNIR power armor-I think they can afford to take a scratch of two from an arrow-or a side arm from the archers. I would say this operation would have little to no causalities on my side-except for maybe myself-and anyone who may be caught up in an accident with their drop pod-and did not have time to lock their armor-especially if there is viscosity in the Gel Layer of their armor. RIP. Though these English archers would probably surrender at these Towering men and women-who rain down from the heavens-showing themselves. Especially if some unlucky defenders were crushed by the Drop Pods. Though-if you meant Spartan Rangers from the Metro series-then this answer will have to be reworked considerably! Either way though ;3 the Defenders would have just cause to fear the future."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"Do not underestimate maintenance costs that may come up during the life of your lease and the cost of exceeding your mileage. Especially true if you plan on driving > 30k miles over the lease.

And maintenance costs typically increase for more expensive cars. Here is my story: Leased a 2015 Lexus RC350 F-Sport for 36-months and 30k miles. I have 10 months left on the lease.Major life change will cause me to turn the lease in with 50k miles, which will cause me 5,000 in excess mileageLexus charge over 300 for the 10k mile service.

Comic books have been around in Japan since as early as the Edo period I believe, so it was a natural step for them to embrace technology in a way to make it a different medium to consume the already familiar format of comic books. (Ghibli was kind of an exception from this, and there's a reason he's considered the “Disney” of Japan) Most anime remain 12 frames a second and is produced quickly, because it's still at the end of the day a visual manga-- a vehicle for the story. (Although I'd argue a lot of anime has cared about visuals as well in the past, like Inu Yasha and some of the other classics.) However, with influence from Western animation, the whole spectrum seems to be changing a bit, and you see animes like Your Lie in April which are just plain gorgeous to watch.

Here are a few examples: 1. Lack of empirical evidence: Critics argue that there is no empirical evidence or scientific proof supporting the existence of an afterlife. Since the afterlife is often considered to be a realm beyond the physical world, it falls outside the scope of direct observation and measurement, making it difficult to provide empirical evidence for or against its existence. 2. Dependence on brain function: Skeptics suggest that consciousness and personal identity are intricately linked to brain function. According to this view, when the brain ceases to function at death, consciousness and personal experiences also come to an end, leaving no basis for an afterlife. 3. Inconsistencies among religious beliefs: Different cultures and religions have diverse and often contradictory beliefs about the afterlife. Critics argue that the wide range of beliefs and lack of consensus among religious traditions weaken the credibility of any specific afterlife claim. The existence of numerous conflicting accounts raises questions about the validity and objectivity of these beliefs. 4. Evolutionary and naturalistic explanations: From a naturalistic perspective, proponents argue that human beliefs in an afterlife may have evolved as psychological and sociocultural constructs. The concept of an afterlife could provide comfort, meaning, and moral guidance, contributing to the survival and cohesion of human societies. 5. Physicalist worldview: Some philosophical and scientific perspectives, such as philosophical materialism or physicalism, posit that everything, including consciousness and personal identity, can be explained by physical processes. From this viewpoint, there is no need to invoke supernatural or metaphysical explanations like an afterlife. It's important to note that these arguments do not definitively disprove the existence of an afterlife. They represent different perspectives that challenge the notion of an afterlife based on empirical evidence, philosophical reasoning, and alternative explanations. The question of whether an afterlife exists or not remains a deeply personal and philosophical matter, often influenced by individual beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and religious or spiritual traditions."},{"prompt":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","completion":"I'll ignore the famous legends (Arthur, Robin, etc) and tell you of a couple of legends from places within twenty miles of my home. First, the Boggart of Boggart Hole Clough. Boggarts aren't an invention of J. K. R, but a legendary creature. Traditionally they lived in peat marshes (locally called \\"Mosses\\") eating those who wander off the few paths through their habitat, they are particularly fond of children (well they do tend to be more tender). They did this for over a thousand years, until humans got their act together, digging out the peat for fuel and soil improvement, digging drains to lower the water table, making the paths and later roads through the mosses safer. Boggarts weren't the most social of beings and didn't co-operate the way humans could when faced with a threat, so slowly they were driven out of their homes, left to wander homeless until they finally died. That is, except for a few individuals. One Boggart saw the writing on the wall, or rather the dropping water levels, and went looking for a new abode. One version of the story has it that the Boggart crossed paths with a priest who rather than cursing the creature on sight, gave it a choice, to either depart this Earth, or to become a helper to a farmer who lived on a rather poor piece of land known as a \\"clough\\" (pron' kluff). The Boggart took the offer and as long as the farmer respected it, the Boggart was a superb farmhand, protecting the farmer's flocks, churning the butter etc. If the farmer failed to respect or thank the Boggart, then the Boggart was allowed to play tricks on the farmer. Sometimes the farmer would deliberately not thank the Boggart, just to see what his helper would do this time. Unfortunately, the farmer died and the farm was taken over by a Mr Bell who didn't know of the arrangement. Here's a poem from about that time, concerning what happened next: Come listen to this merry tale of honest Farmer Bell Who lived in an old farmhouse top of Moston Dell. He was a farmer bold, I heard, who ever gripped a flail, He had cows and horses, pigs and sheep, cheese and nut brown ale. For years and years, time out of mind, a little mischievous elf Made the ancient farmhouse his and there had lodged himself. He ate the butter, drank the milk and sucked the new laid eggs, Put the milk pails up the chimney and cracked the table legs. The farmer’s shoes he filled with sand, often hath been said, Put spiders in the buttermilk and cinders in the bread. Now Farmer Bell he knew fine well, though goodness knew why, The Boggart bore a grudge and drove him mad well nigh. The doors they slammed, the timbers creaked, the very house did shake And pots and pans flew round his head and on the floor did break. Was more than flesh and blood could stand and so thought Farmer Bell, I’ll run away, I will, and somewhere else will dwell. I've stood it long enough I have, it matters not a whit, Needs must when Boggarts hold the reins, I'll pack my things and flit. I am a farmer bold and I will cheat this cunning elf, I'll keep the secret of my plan and leave him to himself. One morning farmer Bell put all his things up on the cart, He locked the door and took the reins, and whispered, “Let us start. We'll leave this Boggart here alone”. Without more ado, \\"Thar't wrong\\", a voice came from the churn, \\"I'm flitten with you too!\\" \\"Thou art not\\" the farmer cried, and turning to his men, Said \\"Get those things down off the cart and in the house again.” “Its just to get away from you”, poor Farmer Bell did sigh, “What can’t be cured must be endured so here I’ll live and die!” Poor Farmer Bell he passed away when he’d lived long enough And now the place where he did dwell is called Boggart Hole Clough. When Farmer Bell died, the farm was abandoned as uneconomic. There is now a 190 acre public park on the site, It's heavily wooded and rather eerie, but as long as you show the Boggart some respect you are perfectly safe… probably. Another local legend is that of the \\"screaming skull of Wardley Hall\\". Wardley Hall is one of the few buildings mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and is now a grade 1 listed building which currently serves as the residence of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford. There is no doubt that there is a skull there, and no doubt about its original owner, the Catholic priest, Father Ambrose Barlow who was hanged, drawn and quartered in 1641 for his faith. His head was impaled on a spike, but the owners of Wardley Hall, who were themselves Catholic, stole the head and hid it in the hall. It wasn't rediscovered until the mid 1700s when part of the hall was remodelled. A servant mistook the skull for that of an animal and threw it into the moat. That night, and for days afterwards, the area was hit by powerful storms which threatened to seriously damage the hall. The owner at that time, Matthew Moreton, had part of the moat drained and the skull recovered and placed back inside the hall. The storms abated within a day. Stories of attempts to burn or remove the skull resulting in massive storms continued for nearly a century, just insulting the skull would cause it to scream, but with the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829, and the hall becoming the residence of a Catholic Bishop, the skull seems to have mellowed. It was even stolen in 1930, but was returned shortly afterwards with the thief merely complaining of \\"bad luck\\" rather than of being struck by lightning."},{"prompt":"keep working out, but I'm not seeing any progress.

She is the woman who deliberately crushed the rights of industrial workers - and also, she is the woman who saved democracy from over-mighty union bosses. She dragged us into a war over worthless rocks in the South Atlantic - and also, restored pride in British arms and saved the Falkland Islanders from a military dictatorship. Same woman, same acts, different perspectives from people with different experiences and priorities. Margaret Thatcher is arguably the single most polarising figure in post-war British history. A lot of people think she was Satan incarnate; a lot of people think she saved the country. A lot of both groups refuse to countenance any more nuanced interpretation than theirs; the ‘correct' response to her name has become a shibboleth - a tribal identification marker. One result of that, of course, is that the people who hold these opinions hold them VERY LOUDLY!!!

It's hardly surprising that they'd assess Thatcher's legacy entirely positively. Quite a lot of people do. Take a look at The Guardian and you'll get a very different take - which quite a lot of people also share. Real life, as ever, is a bit more complicated than either. But that's just my opinion.

Over time, my consumption increased to the point that I was smoking about 30 cigarettes per day, a pack & a half. I wanted to quit for a couple of reasons: The price of my premium brand raised to 7/pack at the convenience stores, and I was experiencing disturbing symptoms…gurgling in my lungs when I lay down in bed, and shortness of breath. In my pre-smoking youth, I was on my HS track team as a miler, and one of my favorite pass times was daylong bicycle rides. My record, on a one-speed Sears tank, was 125 miles between sunrise and a bit after dark. I was convinced I would smoke until some related illness took me out, I could not conceive of quitting as even being a possibility. But, a co-worker received a cigalike as a Christmas present in 2009, which intrigued me. Within a few weeks, I’d ordered and received my first cigalike, it was January 10, 2010. The things were HORRIBLE! But, I knew it was going to change my life. I was right. Over the decade of the 2010s, the technology rapidly improved. But, in the beginning, I spent thousands of dollars buying all kinds of crap that didn’t work for me. Eventually, the tech caught up and there were workable devices available. I haven’t bought any hardware in years, once I found a system that worked for me I stocked up for the rest of my life (I’m 69 today). No interest in chasing the latest boutique devices, I’m settled. For the past 4+ years, I’ve been using primarily unflavored eLiquid: Propylene glycol and nicotine. Flavorings add safety question marks and cost a LOT more money. Once I quit smoking, my lung capacity improved rapidly! I’ve had two doctors tell me that it’s almost like I’d never smoked. If you stop tormenting your lungs, they heal rapidly. You also learn that your senses of taste and smell quickly return. Within only a few weeks of switching, I found I no longer had any interest in smoking. The fact is, I hadn’t planned to quit. It was almost accidental, I had a half dozen cartons of cigarettes on hand. I’d been buying from Ukraine, to save money. I sold one carton dirt cheap to a co-worker, and then literally threw 4–5 cartons in the garbage! No interest in smoking. I bought the first one as a curiosity only. I’m kinda a gadget freak. Vaping has at the very least extended my life. If I’d continued consuming a carton per week, I doubt I’d be alive today. I’ve never used a Juul or any of the other convenience store crap. Yes, I still consume nicotine, but that is an optional component of eLiquid. I mix my own (lots cheaper). I’m mystified that the primary health organizations refuse to endorse the most effective smoking cessation aid ever devised, but rather demonize it. I absolutely do not condone non-nicotine addicts, non-smokers, to take up vaping. I don’t believe any cigarette addict thought they’d become addicted. But millions do. No reasonable person claims it’s without risk. But it’s a greatly reduced risk over habitually inhaling SMOKE. Nicotine isn’t the big killer, it’s the smoke, and vaping produces no smoke."},{"prompt":"What do you think about Joe Biden’s plan to create new manufacturing jobs and boost American production?

These areas are involved in “response” learning. When one relies on these structures for learning, one’s capacity for contextual learning, i. e. the ability for analyzing situations and for seeing the bigger picture, becomes restricted and limited in scope.

Similarly, the English Mastiff is also a very large breed that can weigh up to 220 pounds (100 kg) or more. However, one of the reasons that there are no dogs that reach the same size as the largest big cats is that dogs have been selectively bred by humans for thousands of years to serve various purposes, such as hunting, guarding, and herding. This has led to the development of many different dog breeds with different shapes, sizes, and temperaments.

My PC rig started with a POS computer from Best Buy that my parents got years ago. Paired with a single “HD” monitor and a blue tooth keyboard and mouse combo. The mouse would at times freeze and stop working. I would have to wait and give it a second to catch up. You can see how this is bad you go to turn around to shoot someone and your mouse is frozen. The keyboard would do what is called “ghosting” it happens when multiple keys are pressed at the same time but the keys aren’t registered. I think you can see how this can be annoying especially in games where there is a focus on driving such as World of Tanks. Where you need to drive up quickly to a corner and stop. If your keyboard ghosts and doesn’t register you pressing the stop key, you will end up driving in to the middle of an intersection and get shot in the side and killed. A big selling point of gaming keyboards and mice is that they have anti-ghosting systems and features. They also have a reduced latency. Latency is the measurement of the time it takes the keyboard to register a input from the user and tell the computer about the input.

It was his first year in MBBS college and his eyes caught her. But hold on she is his senior! Damn! He was so confident that he took 5 years to talk to her. No,even after 5 years he didn't express his feelings with her. But somehow he gathered some courage to express his feelings with the Girl's best friend on Facebook. He wrote a big note pristine heartedly. He wrote how and when all this started and how he sees this for future. When her friend showed her the letter. She was impressed but she was never interested in all these things. So it was an indirect no. Boy didn't leave hope . In the 2nd year of his PG he again approached her indirectly. This time girl said that don't come to me, instead approach my family. That would be much better. Boy already shared his feelings with his family and they were ready. Meeting Fixed between 2 families: (They were given 15 minutes to talk and decide). Girl: I want to ask you 2 questions. And my yes depends upon them. Boy: Yes please. Girl: I don't want to marry for 3 more years because I want to support my family financially. Boy: Done. Next please. Girl: Even after marriage I won't stop helping my family financially till my younger brother gets into his field. Boy: No. Girl: Then I am sorry we can't make it. Boy: Hold on I mean, not only you, we both will support your family together. They are my family too. I just want you to be with me. Girl: *smiles & blushes, she was impressed * says, “ its a yes”. So this love story started from both the sides with just this sweet and serious conversation of theirs. “In this case, time was not important for that girl, what she wanted was an honest commitment from him and that's what she got” It is difficult to know at what moment love begins; it is less difficult to know that it has begun.

The famous paper of Einstein, Padolsky and Rosen considered entanglement as the mechanism that could achieve just that, by measuring the two properties using each of two entangled particles. This was meant to highlight an inconsistency with quantum mechanics, but instead actually revealed how quantum mechanics is different from classical reality. When you're just looking at one particle, there is no way around the HUP. The simple act of measurement actually changes the quantum state of the particle to reflect the measurement. Unfortunately that change is simply incompatible with the other measurement. For example, if you make a precise position measurement, the momentum of the particle becomes undefined. Similarly, a precise momentum measurement will correspond to an undefined position. You can actually see this easily enough in practice in real life in common optics. The HUP is completely analogous to diffraction and imaging in optics. That's because the properties of the HUP are described by the mathematics of the Fourier transform, which is a ubiquitous mathematical technique used throughout optics and radio engineering. You may have heard of or actually built a pin hole camera. That works on exactly the same principle as the HUP. It's called a diffractive lens. The pinhole effectively performs a position measurement on the incoming light. The image that is formed on the film is simply those positions arranged on the screen. It's usually simpler to just do a bit of ray tracing to see how the pinhole camera works, but it's just equivalent to the Fourier transform/HUP treatment. Edit: The pinhole actually performs an effective momentum measurement of the incoming light field. Those momenta are transformed into positions at the screen. The image is only formed once you are far enough from the pinhole. This is called the far field. The near field (pin hole) and far field (image) are related by the Fourier transform. The pin hole serves as a momentum filter simply by requiring the light from any distant object travel in a well-defined direction to pass through the hole. This direction, or wavevector, is equivalent to momentum. This is why ray tracing works to explain the pinhole camera. Therefore a momentum measurement at the pinhole is transformed into a position measurement (image) at the screen. The HUP is thus equivalent to stating that the pinhole and the image can't be at the same place. Because I'm short sighted, I would often make a small aperture with my fingers to correct my vision. It works remarkably well. With optics you can see why you can't make two measurements of the same particle. It is related to there being different optical planes. One plane is the imaging plane, which is akin to the position measurement. The other plane is called the Fourier transform plane, and it corresponds to well-defined momentum measurements. The problem is that these two planes cannot co-exist. For example, when the image plane is at the focal point, the Fourier transform plane is at the lens (object at infinity). But when we bring the object to the focal point, the image plane is now retreats to infinity."},{"prompt":"What is the most ridiculous “allergy” or “dietary requirements” a customer has claimed to have while ordering food?","completion":"Interesting that the OP who asked the question is remaining anonymous.

So why does van Gaal do this? THE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. CILLESSEN Cillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn't believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn't informed in advance. However, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice. THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all. He's very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout. Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It's like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn't study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all. DeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that? He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one. Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I'm concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong. Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It's about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick. And then, something amazing happened. Four perfect penalties. Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul.

The Higgs mechanism is the mechanism by which some particles are endowed with rest mass in the Standard Model of particle physics. The essence of the Higgs mechanism is spontaneous symmetry breaking. The idea is that the Higgs field is unlike any other field: its lowest energy state does not coincide with the state when the field is free of excitations. This means that the original, high energy vacuum of the early universe can decay and achieve a lower energy state, the “true” vacuum, by creating excitations in the Higgs field. This has two specific consequences. First, the process breaks the internal symmetry of the mediating particles of the electroweak (unified electromagnetic+weak) interaction, and three out of four of these particles become very massive as a result. (The one that remains massless is the photon.) Second, charged fermions, which used to interact with the Higgs field before symmetry breaking, now interact with the field’s so-called vacuum expectation value, which is nonzero. That is to say, for all practical intents and purposes, particles like electrons and quarks now interact with the vacuum itself, which is equivalent to having mass. So these particles become massive, too. And in this “true” vacuum, the Higgs field behaves differently. It still has short-lived excitations, which we see as short-lived particles: Higgs-bosons. These particles are very massive and decay almost immediately. This convoluted picture allows us to “have our cake and eat it, too”. A theory that starts with massive fermions or massive vector bosons is mathematically ill-behaved. A theory in which these particles are massless can be made well-behaved (“renormalizable”) but we know from observation that particles like electrons do have mass. The Standard Model begins with a theory of massless particles, hence it is renormalizable; yet symmetry breaking then gives us the observed spectrum of massive particles. But beyond these theoretical achievements, this is not something that we can “make use” of. Or rather, we’re making use of it all the time, simply by existing: Electroweak symmetry breaking results in the world around us, with all its low-energy physics and chemistry that makes our existence possible. We can (briefly) replicate conditions before symmetry breaking in high-energy particle experiments, which allow us to study the properties of these particles and the mechanism of symmetry breaking, and understand Nature a little better. Perhaps one day, these experiments may even have direct practical applications. But for now, we are simply building knowledge, not unlike physicists a century ago who were building knowledge that back then had very little use, but nowadays forms the basis of many things, including the semiconductor industry or high-tech medicine.

These two front-end, open-source frameworks for building SPAs and dynamic web applications share a number of characteristics. The key differences between AngularJS and Angular are listed below. Architecture MVC, or Model View Controller Design, is how AngularJS operates. Here, View displays the data from the model while the controller does data processing. Components and directives are used by Angular. Component in this case is a directive with a template. Efficiency and Speed and power The manufacturing process is eventually made less time- and labor-intensive thanks to Angular JS's two-way binding capability. Angular: The revised framework now has a better structure, which improves performance and speed. Management Due to the growing amount of the source code, managing the AngularJS project is challenging. In [LINKED_TEXT: Angular Development] [URL: https://www.binstellar.com/angular-development.html] the code for larger applications written in Angular is easier to write, manage, and better structured. Dependency Injection AngularJS- There is no use of DI. A hierarchical DI method is used in Angular. Routing Due to its component-based architecture, Angular includes an integrated Angular router when comparing AngularJS to Angular. As a result, the components operate independently without the need for a global router and maintain their own sub-routes. On the other side, AngularJS offers native routing that is established via controllers from template to URL routes. Due to its method of imitating a directive for retrieving the client view by using URLs, Angular prevails in this AngularJS vs. Angular contest."},{"prompt":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","completion":"Saalumarada Thimmakka Saalumarada Thimmakka is an Indian environmentalist from the state of Karnataka, noted for her work in planting and tending to 384 banyan trees along a four-kilometre stretch of highway between Hulikal and Kudur.

Books and movies don't do justice when describing a country as vast as India. You can only truly get to know and understand a country after you experience it yourself. Similarly, India is much more than beautiful landscapes and wildlife. It has evolved much over the past few decades by embracing modernity with traditions and cultural diversity. So, what may have been true some years ago, has changed. Here are some distinctive things that can surprise international students coming to [LINKED_TEXT: study in India.] [URL: https://www.studyinindia.gov.in/admission/Registrations] Land of multiple languages: Hindi is not the only language spoken in India. Almost every state has its own language. Only after visiting India do most foreigners realise there are several languages and dialects spoken in different parts of the country. They are also amazed by how linguistic diversity is rarely an issue as many Indians are fluent in English. India is the second-largest English speaking country in the world. Shoes are kept by the door: In many Indian households, people take off their shoes before entering the house. There is usually a shoe rack or a section near the door where guests are expected to leave their shoes. Keeping the footwear outside prevents dust, dirt & germs from entering the house. It applies to religious sites as well with the purpose to preserve the sanctity of that place. Celebrating festivals in India: India is a [LINKED_TEXT: land of diverse cultures and heritage] [URL: https://www.studyinindia.gov.in/know-india-]. As a result, there are many festivals and celebrations you can experience almost every month. If you plan to study in India, do not miss out on celebrating with your Indian friends! You can go all out and dress up in traditional clothes, it will not be considered cultural appropriation here. Indians love it when foreigners embrace Indian culture, and when you dress in traditional clothes, people welcome the gesture happily. Not all Indian food is spicy: Spicy curries are a hallmark of Indian cuisine. However, the country has much more to offer than just spicy food. While many of our dishes do tend to be hot, there are just as many delicious dishes and snacks without a lot of spices. International students are often pleasantly surprised by India's delicious food— like dhoklas and pakoras, as well as delicious meals like dosa, dal makhani, palak paneer etc. Indian sweets are no less! There is also a wide variety of unique sweets like Jalebi, Gajar ka Halwa, Gulab Jamun, etc. that you can try. India is not always hot and humid: Contrary to popular belief, India is not always hot. Due to a variety of topography and other physiographic factors, different parts of the country experience varying climates as per their locations. While summers in India can be extreme in the southern region, this does not hold for the rest of India. Most foreign travellers are amazed and relieved to find that several cities, such as Ooty, Manali, and Shimla, have cool climates even during the hottest of summers. The country also experiences snow, spring and rain besides summers. Vegetarian food in popular fast food chains: Most global fast-food chains in India have a separate vegetarian menu. This might come as a shock to many as most of these foods aren’t available overseas and are exclusive to India. Alongwith the popular fast food chains like McDonald’s, many restaurants across India serve only vegetarian or Jain food (Vegetarian food that excludes underground vegetables).

However when riding for longer periods (>1 hour) you might find that this could turn into discomfort as it may block off blood flow some of the larger muscle groups (glutes and lower back). Gravity also plays a different role and you might find that blood pumps more easily through your legs than when riding an upright bicycle. This has a downside in that you can no longer use your body weight to push down on your pedals. There are a number of benefits to recumbent exercise bikes without many downsides compared to an upright bicycle. Personally I prefer a recumbent exercise bike because it leaves your hands free, is more comfortable and allows you to do any one of a hundred things while riding a bicycle and getting a work out."},{"prompt":"milk with Bournvita healthy?","completion":"Bournvita is Never healthy option for your or even not for any child… Add Pure Honey (Led and Sugar Free)in milk or home made powder of mix dry fruits is good for your loving child to grow in better way… Good Luck for your child's better future Thank and Regards Dhawal Parekh (M) : 9898599755"},{"prompt":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","completion":"Oh we have realized that for some time now.

I knew people who can’t thrive unless tehy work in freelance of for themselves. What is hugely different is in the expectations area, and it deals with certitudes vs incertitude. When you work for someone else, you do it in a framework of collaboration, by which you have to meet certain expectations, and they have to fulfill others. It’s a 2 parties sport, and you want to do your part, so they would theirs. THAT is why you get up on time, to make sure you’ve done your part, being both anxious as you are eager for them to do theirs. When working for yourself, you have to establish the milestones, the rules, the expectations, the consequences when you fail. If you can’t play this 1 player game, nobody cares, you have to suffer by your own fault. Also when working with customers, a company can set boundaries. It can also retain money from a bigger project and pay you in trances, so you won’t be tempred to spend them all at once. When working by yourself you have to set the boundaries and assert them yourself, otherwise clients can end up calling at all hours, disturbing your private life or looking for made-up reasons not to pay for your work. Just saying, as I’ve heard such complaints from freelance consultants. Also, if you make a lot of money now, but cannot manage it properly, it may be that in a couple of months you are broke."},{"prompt":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","completion":"I’ve been to both cities, they seem about the same, not sure what streets you spend all your time in in SF but it’s reasonably clean, it’s not Disneyland but then it’s an open city (without an army of guys in straw hats sweeping the live long day).

Here’s the ‘claim’, in the form of an assertion, from a most credible source: Zuheir Muhsin, a member of the PLO Executive Council, published in the March 31, 1977 edition of the Dutch Newspaper “Trouw”: “The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct Palestinian people to oppose Zionism."},{"prompt":"Why does your brain release chemicals like dopamine for itself?

And if so, when do you get to do that?","completion":"No-one did it in my taping day, but I figure any complaints or protests of that sort would be addressed to the production assistants sent to check on the contestants during the commercial breaks (one in the middle of the first round, one before Double Jeopardy! and one after the Final Jeopardy category is revealed) and settled before the cameras roll again (if scores need to be adjusted the host will make note of this on camera before resuming gameplay). Since the show is taped in advance, the judges (who are seated on a row of tables in front of the audience) aren’t constrained by time to make their decisions, since all that time isn’t necessarily the same length as the two-minute or so commercial breaks. During my taping a judge did rule that a “pizza slice” mentioned by a contestant as a way to slow down when skiing was an appropriate equivalent to turning the fronts of one’s skis towards each other."},{"prompt":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","completion":"Oh yes, indeedy.

For the next 5 or so years, everything was fine and she greeted me as one would expect a friendly family dog to do. Then I went to university in a distant city … Oh boy, was I in the dog house when I came back for a weekend at half-term. Sally not only wouldn’t look at me, she’d walk out of the room if I came in. She wouldn't even take a biscuit from me - something unheard of in the annals of history. Conniving her way into the biscuit box was one of her skills. This went on from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon. Then she, almost reluctantly, but of her own doing, came up to me and offered me her paw. And everything was back to normal. What added to the poignancy of the moment was that I was due to return to university in a matter of hours. I still miss that dog after forty years.

That in itself is a deterrent for many, but on the other hand Canada suffers from a major shortage of family doctors leaving millions with no other choice but to attend emergency departments for basic medical care which only adds to the wait times. Its great that there is no charge and everyone has equal access, but the system is largely broken and poorly run. Many people die because of prolonged wait times for procedures that could have saved their lives had it been done sooner.

So I went to their Livspace Experience Centre in Chennai, and the designers showed me a few designs, walked me through the quality of materilas, and explained how to use them in detail. It seemed extremely promising to me. I was conversing with Livspace at the same time as speaking with some local sellers. When I told one of the merchants that I was also thinking about Livspace, he tried to steer me in the wrong direction. However, after conducting extensive research and reading several [LINKED_TEXT: Livspace reviews] [URL: https://www.livspace.com/in/page/livspace-reviews], I concluded that Livspace was the superior alternative. The Livspace home interior offers excellent hospitality. While I was visiting the Livspace home interior Centre, the designer assigned to me was kind enough to explain everything about the Livspace products, from modular kitchen units to closets and storage. He was polite enough to give satisfactory answers to all of my questions. We visited the centre several times. I went alone at first, then with my family. I felt that the quality of material given was highly consistent and honest across all of the talks. That's when I realized that Livspace was an excellent match for my style and goal for my home's interior design. The staff were friendly and outstanding. They were accommodating in closing my deal on acquiring house interiors with a decent offer and suggested some significant adjustments to my designs to match my taste and budget. The designer helped in making my dream interiors a reality. The designer's comprehensive explanation of the project. I shared the floor blueprints with Livspace and was given a quote immediately. It appeared to be easy work at first, but several aspects were considered, such as the materials, quality, and waterproofing, among others. I didn't know much about these topics at the time. The designer and project manager, on the other hand, guided me through everything. They gave me a 3D model of our entire modular kitchen to help me comprehend it better. The project team did an excellent job. Everyone was courteous and diligent in their job, as far as I and the Livspace company reviews could tell. Every day, the on-site manager would check in to make sure the carpenters were following the plans. He was a fantastic worker. Even though I lived on-site and could monitor the project's development, both the designer and the project manager kept in touch with me. The Livspace team goes above and beyond the call of duty. One point I'd want to make is that some of my current furnishings have been ruined. The project manager at Livspace assisted in resolving the issue by repairing it while also improving its appearance and making it more robust.

A well known alcoholic/drug abuser that lived a short distance from the local hospital would go party the night away at homes all over the county and if at the end of the night, she couldn’t get a ride home, she would fake a seizure. She knew that calling 911 would secure her a ride home. We would pick her up, transport her to the Medical Center, she would sign out AMA and make the short walk to her house. A couple of times she would be ready to go before we could even finished the call report. In all fairness, she did have a history of seizures, and when they were legit the circumstance were different. We would be paged to her house, she would be sober and exhibiting signs of having just had a seizure (postictal, loss of bladder etc.) However, she would abuse the system using her epilepsy as a legitimate excuse, just to get a very expensive taxi ride home that she had no intention of paying for anyways. She became an expert at faking unconsciousness, you could perfom a sternal rub and she wouldn’t flinch, ammonia inhalents would not phase her. Although suspecting when she was faking it, we had no other choice but to treat accordingly. One particular night, we were paged out to a pedestrian versus car accident. Enroute, first responders were giving us patient updates over the radio like patient is unresponsive. We arrived on scene, there was “K” lying in the ditch unconscious and “unresponsive”, although she had no signs of trauma and her vitals were perfect, probably better than mine. We packaged her, Cervical-collar, full spinal immobilization, the works. After getting her into the back of the ambulance I attempted to check her pupils again, she would squinch her eyes making it difficult to open them. I swear, she almost had a slight smile on her face while I was doing it. I decided to try something, After leaving the scene and while enroute to the hospital, I yelled to my partner and told him to divert to another hospital that was about 25 miles away. It was like a resurrection from the dead, she come up off the spine board ripping off the cervical collar, trying to undo the straps that were securing her to the board, all the while saying I dont’ want to go to another hospital, stop and let me out right here. Yep, you guessed it, she was faking again. I told her to calm down that we would take her to the local hospital. I then asked her if she had really been hit by a car, she admitted that she hadn’t but that it was cold and she needed a ride home. I thoroughly documented the call. It was the last straw for my EMS director, he had her prosecuted for Misuse of 911."},{"prompt":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","completion":"This famous photo was taken in 1961 as the Berlin Wall was being built.

It is true that until the twentieth century most Palestinians didn’t identify as Palestinian. Most of the people they came into contact with were also Palestinian, so a more useful answer to the question “Where are you from?” was to name their village. But to the outside world they were Palestinians. The villages they identified with were villages in Palestine. As for their origins, they are descendants of the ancient Canaanites and have been a continuous presence in Palestine for all that time, so the idea that they are just a mix of people from elsewhere is completely false. Think for a moment of Italy. Before the mid 19th century the Italian nation state did not exist and very few people thought of themselves as Italian. But it is completely undeniable that the nation of Italy exists and that Italian ethnicity exists. If we are to accept the Zionist argument that Palestinian ethnicity is bogus, we must accept that Italian ethnicity is bogus too."},{"prompt":"What is the best one liner you have written?","completion":"Well,I have written something for myself❤️ Don't know if it is best or not :) Thanks for Reading :)"},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"You can start making money online right now by downloading tiktok and use the code BQ79441061 to start making money"},{"prompt":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","completion":"There are several good cars available in India for under 10 lakhs, depending on your needs and preferences.

I should know. I was morbidly obese as a schoolboy and have continued to put on weight since then. At twenty nine I weigh about 430 pounds. It has altered how I stand. With rolls of fat under my arms, my arms cannot hang perpendicularly to my body but are pushed outwards. I have put on considerable weight on my thighs so my legs are splayed and, to limit the amount of rubbing of my thighs against each other, I have more of a waddling walk and my stance and gait places unnatural stress on my knees and ankles. With the greater amount of weight in front my spine is flexed against it with my shoulders back and my head forward, which is a typical posture for a morbidly obese person. Being so heavy has changed my posture and gait and restricts my movements. I cannot cross my legs, get up from the floor without help or pick up objects from the ground. The most continual limitation to ordinary living is my inability to stand for an extended period or to walk significant distances. If I am on my feet for any length of time my back, and knee and ankle joints ache and become inflamed. When you do not need a seat you imagine that public spaces have many seating areas. When you actually need to sit, you find how few they actually are. Walking has its hazards. I do not like walking on uneven ground. I cannot see where I am putting my feet and I often have numbness in my feet which affects my balance. If I fall I risk serious injury so I generally keep to paved, even paths and sidewalks. Climbing stairs is an effort and I quickly become short of breath and start to perspire. Actually I feel hot most of the time. I know my mobility would be improved if I used a mobility scooter but I have held off getting one as it would result in me walking even less and taking less physical exercise. But suppose the day will eventually come when I succumb. The other constant handicap is that, despite the number of severely obese people, modern life makes little, if any, accommodation for them. Seating is an issue in all forms of public transport, many private cars, many toilet stalls (I am too fat to use a urinal), cinemas, theaters and many restaurants. Moving around in many shops also causes difficulties. Also, everything takes longer: getting washed and dressed, toileting, getting in and out of a car and walking generally. At first my health was not particularly affected by my weight, apart from periodic skin rashes and, as I have mentioned, joint pain. But not for long. As is quite typical, low esteem, lack of self confidence and loneliness led to depression for which I have been given antidepressants. Then I developed sleep apnea which means I am now reliant on a CPAP machine to sleep properly. Since then I have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome and will always need medication to control my high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels. I am prediabetic and at risk of developing type 2 diabetes with the attendant need for medication to control it. When I started suffering from sleep apnea I bought a bariatric hospital style bed as it enabled me to sleep with my upper body in an elevated position, which helped. It is easier to get on it and has a strap hanging down to pull me up. Since then I have acquired all sorts of equipment and specially designed furniture to assist me in everyday living. I had my bathroom redesigned with a higher, stronger toilet seat and enlarged shower cubicle. I have various long handled gadgets to help me wash, toilet, dress and pick thing up from the floor. I also have a recliner and dinning chairs which are made to take my weight. With my physical limitations in walking and fitting into seats and other spaces, it dictates what social events I can attend. I have become very wary of assurances that I will find no difficulties in attending an event. Normal sized people simply do not understand what my limitations are. For example, an invitation to a picnic or beach party sounds straightforward enough. What you may not have counted on was the long walk carrying baskets of food and drink over very uneven surfaces and a complete absence of seating when you get there. Yes, I can carry a folding chair, if I can manage it. If not, I will face the embarrassment of being hauled to my feet by at least two strong people. So, you can appreciate, I attend far fewer social gatherings than most people and where I spend my holidays and what I do on them is severely impacted. Another limitation is what clothing I can buy. After 4XL sizes most ordinary shops, apart from national chains, have little on offer. I generally buy on the internet where reasonably priced ordinary casual clothing is available. I long ago gave up buying suits. When I did for a special occasion I would wear it once and by the time I needed it again I could not fit into it. I generally wear joggers as they have elasticated waists, polo shirts and hoodies. As I cannot get down to tie shoe laces, all my shoes are slip-ons. The problem with large sizes is they are generally made for taller people and I am below average height, so the arms and legs are nearly always too long. Casual clothes are fine for work but I know it irritates my parents when I wear them to a formal occasion but it can’t be helped. People have preconceived ideas of morbidly obese people. I sense it acutely when I enter a room. How on earth did he get into such a terrible shape? What a loser. Very fat people are regarded as lacking any sort of self control, and being lazy, gluttonous,unhygienic and unhealthy. This carries into employment prospects too. Morbidly obese people stay in the same job for longer and are likely to receive fewer promotions and lower remuneration. I know that is why I haven’t changed jobs because finding employment is hard when a prospective employer thinks I will always be off sick or cannot physically do the job. As it happens I work longer hours and take fewer days off sick than nearly all my work colleagues. By nature and through experience I am quite a solitary person. I was teased and bullied at school and learned to keep myself to myself. I think the unhappiness I experienced led me to binge eat, which is a completely self defeating thing to do. I was unhappy because I was fat so I eat too much which made me fatter. In doing so, I became quite addicted to fast foods and sugary drinks and this addiction continues. I feel hungry nearly all of the time and the only food and drink that seems to satisfy is either fatty or sugary. I crave it constantly. In fact eating is one of my great pleasures. While it has not been deliberate, I find most of my close friends are obese; not as obese as I am, but on the large side nonetheless. I think they are not so judgemental about obesity and see me for who I am, rather than the size I have become. They also know how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off. The answer you may suggest is that I should really work at dieting. If I had received a dollar for every time I was advised to lose weight I would be a wealthy man. My mother nagged me constantly and grumbled that I so quickly grew out of my school clothes. No doctors appointment goes without this advice. Well meaning friends and colleagues volunteer this recommendation too; sometimes even strangers. I am in admiration of the morbidly obese people who have lost weight and kept it off, but they are a very small proportion. The sad fact is that once you are morbidly obese, particularly if you became so in childhood, you will remain so. Like nearly every morbidly obese person I have been on countless diets. Weight loss is disappointingly slow. At some stage I abandon the diet out of frustration and quickly put back the weight and some more. If there was an easy way to lose weight there would be far fewer obese people. As it is we represent an increasing percentage of the adult population. In summary, I am resigned to being morbidly obese. I have learned to live with it and to work with the limitations it imposes. I don’t want surgery or any other intervention. In fact accepting who I am without complaint has been a considerable help. It has overcome my depression and I am no longer on medication for it. Now I just want to live my life and play out the hand I have been dealt."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"Some of the best freelancing sites include Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, Toptal, and Guru.

I worry how some people coped before Quora was available to spoon-feed their questions. It would be more efficient for you (and better for others) to ask such questions on Google than Quora because: • the response is instant on Google (you may have to wait a day, week, month, year or even forever to get an answer on Quora). • The answers you get on Google are generally very good and comprehensive. • Your research skills will improve, rather than having to rely on others to answer your question on Quora. • You won’t waste other people’s time in answering simple questions on Quora. • My inbox won’t be filled up with so many Quora emails asking me to answer questions that are readily answered on Google.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","completion":"A modern Greek speaker can go back much further than an English speaker, but not as far back as I think you may be imagining. A lot, of course, depends on the education of the Greek speaker. For a Greek speaker who is literate but not particularly trained in the ancient languages, they could probably make out a lot of most medieval texts and perhaps even some of the Greco Roman texts during late classical times. Compare this to English where reading texts that are more than a few hundred years old is virtually impossible for the average English speaker. The term Ancient Greek refers to the languages that existed before Alexander the Great. That was a very long time before the Romans came along. A modern Greek speaker would struggle to make out anything in those ancient languages without a lot of training. Why are Greek speakers able to read text that are so much older than English speakers? Greek has had a strong literary and intellectual tradition for millennia. It was also a very standardized international language for trade from the time of Alexander all the way until the end of the Middle Ages. As such, Greek has been far more stable and less prone to the extreme borrowing from other languages than English. EDIT: Another factor that has kept Greek somewhat stable over the last couple of thousand years. Greek culture has been viewed as a seminal culture throughout the Mediterranean and Europe for an extremely long time. The Arabs, Romans, Slavs , Turks , Germans and many others borrowed heavily from the Greek language. By contrast, Greek has borrowed small amounts from other languages but in particular has borrowed from ancient Greek, effectively borrowing from itself. The point is that the outside influences that tend to heavily influence other languages have been less of a factor for Greek in the last couple of millennia."},{"prompt":"What percentage of guys in the gym use steroids?","completion":"Anabolic steroid is a type of steroid that is used in medicine to repair body tissues and to increase appetite and the growth of muscles. Anabolic steroids are made in the laboratory from testosterone They have in common the removal of a C19 methyl group from the androgen structure; this accentuates the effect of increasing [LINKED_TEXT: muscle bulk] [URL: https://portallucena.com/] at the expense of virilization. All anabolic steroids resemble testosterone in their pharmacological actions, but they vary in the ratio of anabolic to androgenic properties. Some preparations are active when taken orally, others have to be injected to avoid extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. They promote weight gain and bone mineralization. To this end, they are occasionally used in patients in a hypercatabolic state e.g. chronic debilitating illness, malignancy. However, the effect of anabolic steroids on muscle growth and activity has lead to their abuse by body builders and athletes. Illicit use is associated with dangerous side effects ranging from cholestatic jaundice to death when taken for several weeks, with a carefully controlled diet and exercise regimen, supraphysiological doses of testosterone (around 5-10 times the recommended replacement dose for male hypogonadism) increase fat-free body mass, muscle size and strength in healthy adult males, when compared with placebo plus diet and exercise Body builders and other gym-users sometimes use even bigger doses to increase muscle mass and strength, heighten aggression, and facilitate harder, more vigorous training Moderate increases in liver transaminase levels are common in people taking anabolic steroids; occasionally cholestatic jaundice and severe hepatotoxicity occur. Risk of liver toxicity is greatest with chronic administration of large doses of orally active C-17a alkylated steroids such as methandienone, methyltestosterone or stanozolol. Androgenic effects of anabolic steroids that occur commonly in both men and women are oily skin and hair."},{"prompt":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","completion":"Sure, here are some mind-blowing facts that may sound unreal but are actually true: 1.

While the US has made significant strides in education, certain systemic issues continue to plague the system and impede optimal learning outcomes. Let's explore some of the most critical problems of the quality of education in USA 1. Overemphasis on Standardized Testing The [LINKED_TEXT: education system in USA] [URL: https://numeneduservices.com/education-system-in-usa] gives standardized exams like the SAT and ACT much too much weight. As they largely measure memorizing and test-taking abilities rather than critical thinking, creativity, and practical knowledge, these exams frequently fall short of capturing a student's full potential. As a result, students frequently find themselves cramming knowledge without understanding it. 2. Lack of Holistic Learning The US educational system frequently places a strong emphasis on essential courses like math and science while ignoring the humanities, arts, and social sciences. This contrasts with the Indian educational system, which encourages a well-rounded education with emphasis on numerous areas. This limited scope limits pupils' exposure to a range of subjects, impeding their overall intellectual growth and capacity to think critically from a variety of angles. 3. Lack of Teacher-Student Interaction A student's learning experience may suffer as a result of the huge class sizes and little teacher-student interaction in the US educational system. In contrast to Indian schools, where teachers frequently have a closer relationship with their students, American educators may find it challenging to give each student individualized attention and assistance. Because of this, pupils' ability to advance academically and develop personally may suffer from a lack of guidance and mentoring. 4. Limited Practical Application of Knowledge The US educational system today favors academic learning above practical application. While theoretical ideas are crucial, it's also necessary to provide students with chances to use what they've learned in practical settings. By integrating more hands-on projects, internships, and industry collaborations into the curriculum, students can develop critical skills that are necessary for their future careers. 5. Inequality and Disparities There are major inequalities and disparities throughout the US educational system, particularly along socioeconomic lines. Students from underprivileged homes frequently don't have as much access to resources, quality education, and extracurricular activities that might benefit their entire development. To develop a more equitable and inclusive educational system, closing this gap and guaranteeing equal chances for all students should be a top goal. In conclusion, even though the education system in USA has many positive aspects, such as its emphasis on innovation and research-oriented universities, it is crucial to recognize its weaknesses and make improvements. From the perspective of an Indian student, addressing the excessive emphasis on standardized testing, promoting holistic learning, encouraging better teacher-student interaction, enhancing the practical application of knowledge, and reducing disparities are essential steps towards creating a more effective and equitable education system in USA."},{"prompt":"What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?","completion":"I would say the answer best depends on your stream of study. First year students have class times from anywhere between 10 - 30 hours per week (lectures, tutorials and labs included). I would address Non- engineers first, then the engineers. For Non-engineers, be prepared to memorize stuff. Professors in the social sciences would go through material faster than Usain Bolt and you’d be cramming right before the exam trying to cover the 20 pages the professor spent 2 minutes on during lecture. Play it smart, understand how you can study best, skip some classes, attend others and form a network of peers who can actually help. For Comp. Sci., Rotman Commerce and Mathematics and Medicine, choose your courses wisely. The course descriptions you are supposed to look at to guide you are very misleading at times. Math, specially can be hard. Unless you love math, do not go for 137 or 157. 133 is light, 135/6 is a bit harder but bearable if you still want a challenge. You can choose 4-6 courses per semester, do not overburden yourself. Summer courses may feel tempting but they aren’t so good. Professors cram through material strikingly fast. To quote a senior “by the time you’re done saying “Hi” to the kid next to you, your midterm is tomorrow”, keep that in mind before deciding if you want to leave a course for the summer. Bottom line: It’s bearable, you made it to u of t, you can make it through u of t. My general advice for first year Keep up with your readings, the last thing you want to do is read 300 pages one day before the examCommunism wins. Find a good group of friends, enter into group chats and leverage them to your benefit. Help others and get help from others, you can not survive alone (unless you’re very smart, in that case, help others, the majority depends on you).Doctor your schedule. Keep enough gaps between classes so you can study. Don’t rush to end your days early, because at home there are too many distractionsKnow your professors. Some professors are superstars and some aren’t that good. Know which professors are best. Sometimes changing classes for the professor even if it messes up your timetable is worth it.Residences are over-rated. The prevalent joke is, people living in residences, don’t actually live in residences, they live in the libraries. They only go back to sleep.Do firsthand research on courses. For Electives and Seminar courses the descriptions on the internet are misleading. Ask someone who has taken the course how it is.Come to Campus. Even if you have only 2 classes on a particular day, come to campus. You may just end up catching up on something you would not have caught up on at home.Resist temptation. We are told u of t is fun, and there are a lot of “fun” places in and around campus, at one point you have to stop the “fun”, know when to apply the breaks.Be Realistic. While pessimism is definitely not a good idea, optimism isn’t either. You have to know what you are weak in, in order to play on your strengths. Don’t expect too much from life at u of t, have a sense of how much material you actually know before a test and try to capitalize the most out of it.Set a minimum threshold. Learn at least enough of everything that on an exam you will be able to write some good sounding rubbish in the tests. If there is even a shred of merit to your answer, you may get something, which is, as we have been told since eternity, still better than nothing.Not academic advice, but advice anyways! In the TTC we (do not) trust. Keep buffer times during your commute if you have a commute. Engineers usually have a greater workload (unless you are going for a double major in Comp.Sci. and Math; believe me there are people who do that!) that any other discipline in the university. For future engineers, be ready to give up everything you used to do for leisure in high school, it’s that bad. Nah, just kidding. The two semesters are very different in terms of the content covered. There is a lot of Math in first semester. Calculus 1 is partially review from grade 12 but towards the end they push through integration very quickly, and it is included on the final exam, look out for that. CIV100 is a physics course, dreadful, look out for that, introduces you to moments and forces and asks you to start thinking in 3d spaces right away. Depending on your taste for Mathematics, either you would love linear algebra or hate it. Three things to keep in mind about it, it is abstract, introduces you to proofs, and is useless for engineers. Second semester is a bit better (p.s. you get used to it). there are 2 physics (the physics of electricity - light and the physics of motion (Dynamics) - much heavier). Calc 2 has much less content than Calc1, the professors cover material very slowly because there isnt much to cover. It gets bad after the first 8 weeks. my advice for engineers: All lectures are recorded, there is no excuse of falling behind on material, if you miss class (or skip it, NOT RECOMMENDED), watch the lectures and catch up.Get into as many group-chats as possible. Group chats are the first resource of help when you are new, no body knows you, and you need help.Assignments and 1st year labs are free marks. If you can’t do them the group chat’s/friends would do it for you, don’t leave them (lowkey - I didn’t tell this to y’all).Learn to play it smart. GPA’s work weird, if you get 90’s in 3 courses and a 70’s in the other 2, congratulations your GPA just went down the drain. My advice: set a goal for what GPA you want, if you know you’re safely in the range, start focusing on other courses.Don’t leave anything blank. If writing F = ma can give you one mark, write it down (cough cough, it actually happend to me). You will see the pricelessness when right before the exam you are calculating what you need for the mark you were aiming for. Study just enough to write down at least some good sounding rubbish in the answer space.Always keep in mind, we don’t live in the USSR, even though the TTC was North America’s best transit system in 2017 (no comments), expect delays. keep buffers if you have to reach skule for important lectures/exams/labs.

Avoid slouching or hunching forward, as this can strain your back and neck.Use a supportive chair: Choose a chair that provides adequate lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of your lower back. If your chair lacks proper support, consider using a lumbar roll or cushion.Position your feet flat on the floor: Keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. If your feet don't reach the floor, use a footrest or an adjustable chair to maintain a comfortable position.Maintain a relaxed posture: Avoid tensing your shoulders and neck. Relax your muscles and allow your arms to rest comfortably on the desk or armrests.Position the monitor at eye level: Adjust the height of your computer monitor or laptop screen so that the top of the screen is at or slightly below eye level. This helps prevent strain on your neck and eyes.

Entrepreneurial Mindset: How to Think Like an Entrepreneur? Who is an Entrepreneur and who is not? An entrepreneur is a person who does business with new methods. There is a thought behind doing business, a vision. Through his business, he makes an impact on the lives of the people, providing solutions to their problems. He is not afraid of the idea of failure while doing something new but tries to succeed by taking risks even if some of his efforts or plans do not succeed. Even then, keeping in mind his big objective, he keeps trying to succeed afresh even after taking losses. Entrepreneurial Mindset You would not call a person an entrepreneur even if he does his own business and is successful in his business, for whom the purpose of working is limited to making a living or earning profit and his main motivation is to find solutions to the problems of his people. It doesn't happen. He is afraid of failures and gets disheartened by minor failures and gives up even his important and ambitious plans. What is the difference between an Entrepreneurial Mindset and an Entrepreneurship School of Education? By the education of entrepreneurship skills, we mean – teaching the learner or student about various aspects of business. Like keeping an account of profit and loss, making plans to increase business, marketing customer service etc. By the education of Entrepreneurial Mindset, we mean – to inculcate the thinking of doing something new or doing it in a new way within the students. To inculcate in oneself the curiosity to find new solutions to problems and challenges and to inculcate the confidence to work on that solution, to inculcate the courage to persevere in one's purpose despite setbacks and challenges, and to develop leadership qualities with the eagerness to learn new things, to develop. Through an entrepreneurial mindset, you can develop the qualities that will make you an entrepreneur in whatever you do. What is the difference between being an entrepreneur and having the mindset to be an entrepreneur? By now it is clear that the meaning of crying entrepreneur is- a person who does his business but taking risks with new thinking, new way. Whereas Entrepreneurship Mindset refers to the way a person thinks and lives, whether he does business or does a job. It is necessary that every entrepreneur will have an entrepreneurial mindset, but it is not necessary that every person with an entrepreneurial mindset will be an entrepreneur. On what basis can we tell whether someone has an Entrepreneurial mindset or not? You can identify whether you have an entrepreneurial mindset by the way you think and act. Regardless of whether you work or do business, if you practice thinking fresh and adopting new ways before doing that work, you are full of faith in your thinking and new ways or fail. You are not intimidated, find solutions to problems and challenges and you are driven to work on them, and doing that work in a way that affects other people's lives, alleviates their problems, or gives them something provides new. What is the difference between a normal educated person and a person with an Entrepreneurial mindset? Many times you see that many people do not understand beyond their circumstances due to lack of entrepreneurial mindset, are afraid to take risks and therefore settle for a job or business that is less than their ability and talent. A normal educated person may have a degree or diploma, may have a good job or may have a successful business, but it is also possible that he has not understood his talent properly or despite being able to find it, work according to it. Have not been able to achieve success. The same person united with an entrepreneurial mindset recognizes his talents and the strong sides of his personality. He is not afraid of failure to innovate. He can take decisions based on analysis. He is ready to change himself according to the situation, the reason for being troubled by problems, with deep thinking, taking cooperation, believes in creating a new opportunity for himself. A person with an Entrepreneurial mindset takes care of honesty and ethics along with success in his career.

Ranger Companies are much smaller than Airborne Infantry Companies. A Division is a self supporting unit and contains its own Artillery, Recon, MPs, Medical Units, Logistics and Supply and is much much larger than a Regiment. Currently Rangers are assault units and shock units designed for specialized combat missions like airfield, bridge, prisoner recoveries or key terrain assaults. A Division would be more big picture strategic in its assignments. Currently the 82nd Airborne is our only Airborne Division. The 101st is now Air Assault. Airborne school was mostly PT and conditioning so I was glad I attended prior to Ranger School. Ranger school was more patrol oriented and was far more varied in the skills taught. It was also very much a small unit leadership course. Ranger missions today are very different than they were in Vietnam or back in WW2 or Korea. Instead of assault, shock troops deployed in Companies, and Battalions the primary focus was recon in 4 to 6 man elements. A platoon sized mission was rare. I am not sure how Rangers are used in todays operational theaters."},{"prompt":"Why do narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths seem to know how to read people?","completion":"Narcissists study you closely, at least initially. Their envy can seem a lot like love to the unwary, when you're in love with someone you want to know all about them, and this is the same when you want to destroy them too. Being predators, these three subtypes superficially study people, to figure out how they tick. Lacking empathy, they exploit this knowledge for all it's worth. The sad thing is that in your desire to people please, you end up doing half the work for them, telling on yourself in the hope that they will not feel threatened by you, advertising your weaknesses as a type of friendship offering. Although it may be unpleasant at first having someone who wants to destroy you, don't shy away, don't appease them either, rise to the challenge. You didn't start it, but you'll finish it. There's a righteousness in defence that doesn't occur when one is preying on someone else — you may feel grandiosity as though God is on your side. You are standing up to defend what is right, and this rage can be deeply intoxicating. Use it wisely, don't merely waste it in childish tantrums. Wars are won by the cunning, not the stupid.

They have them because of new regulations passed in the European Union. Collectively, they’re called the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). See [LINKED_TEXT: https://eugdpr.org/] [URL: https://eugdpr.org/] They came up because people in Europe did not want to pay for services with their personal data as we do in the U.S. And because they believe that their data is their own.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"I have two daughters, 9 and 10. I have full custody of both children and I love my children dearly. They are my entire life. I love being a dad, ever since I was 12 years old I saw my older cousins have kids before they were 25 and I said I want that! My relationship ended primarily to my spouse being unfaithful. She is barely in the lives of our children and lives 3 hours away from us. I have tried for years to encourage the mother to take a stronger role in her childrens lives and have never been vindictive about access to the children. In short she simply does not want to be a mother. Anyone who knows us can see this. My oldest child is literally a clone of myself. Looks, personality, etc. My second child is a lot like her mother. I am a heavy set man, my oldest daughter has a bit of a heavy set. My ex was a petite woman and my second daughter is a petite girl. My ex and I have both have brown hair brown eyes. My oldest daughter has brown hair, brown eyes. My second daughter is blonde, blue eyes. Personality wise I feel my second daughter is very similar to myself although she has been living with me since she was 3 years old. I love my daughter so much and I have always had it in the back of mind she was not mine. I would feel so crushed if I found out I wasn’t her biological father. I do not know if it is instinct or something but its almost like a scent I have with my daughters where I know 100% my oldest daughter is mine but I do not have the same feeling with the my second daughter. This to me is strictly a feeling. Not love or caring but something else. I can’t really explain it. To compare it’s like an animal knowing that one of her babies isn’t in the litter. I know finding out will crush me and I know it will create more problems with the mother because now I will want to know who it is. I cannot get it out of my head and I have gone in and out wondering if I should get the test done. The test has been sitting in storage for years and I have never bothered to open it because I am simply afraid to find the truth. I am weighing the pros and cons of finding out and there are several more cons. I have to know….I don’t know why. I know I would not cast her out if the results were negative, I would absolutely continue to be her father as that is all she ever known and it would be detrimental to her wellbeing to find out the one parent who did not abandon her is not really her father. I couldn’t imagine would that would do to her life. Alas, I want to know one day. I am thinking more and more about doing it and I feel I am in a good place mentally to process the information and continue our lives. I do not know what to do. I know you will think if you love her, what’s the point of finding out? I have given their mother so many chances and held so many reservations for her only to find she does more harm then good in the 12% of a month she actually has them when they decide to even go to her home. I feel I need to realize that I should be focusing more on the children’s lives then a woman who does not want to be a mother. I feel that I have wasted time encouraging them to respect their mother when she does not respect them. There is little emotional connection to their mother. I encourage them to call her as she rarely calls to talk to them. When they are on the phone after about a minute or two of the hi how are you it is complete silence between the 3 of them. I’m sitting there smacking myself in the face, but this is a direct representation that the kids are not going to take an interest in someone who doesn’t take an interest in them. When I call them we talk, same with anyone else in their life who they have learned actually care about them. I feel in a weird way finding out help me lose the connection to their mother which I now feel is what is best for my kids. I should not worry about them having a normal mother because they never will. I tried to do the right thing and never bad talked her or went after her for money or withheld my children as they were pawns. I took a 1/3 of the child support because I did not want to make our separation about money and I absolutely despise people who use the advantage of primary care/full custody to gauge the other party. Your kids are not your ex, the foundation of child support is broken. I do not agree with it so I do not partake in its guidelines. If I needed someone elses money to raise my children then I would not of had them in the first place. Aside from that I am broken in my decision and would appreciate any input.

It raises the risk of rot, but rainwater is so much better for the plants that tap water with all its mineral and chlorine and fluorides, thus they really love the rain, assuming good drainage. Rain flushes away a lot of those bad things in tap water. The ideal way to water C&S is with collected rain water, distilled or RO purified water, when the weather is dry, so they dry off fairly fast. Usually rain, especially in humid climates is punctuated with long periods of very high humidity. Often the rains lasts for days.

Talaash builds the momentum beautifully and keeps you guessing (although it can be predicted by hard core movie buffs) until the very moment the movie explodes with its twist. The casting cannot be any better for this film with powerful performances by everyone- my favorite is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who I believe can be rated as the new gen Naseeruddin Shah.

I am the trustee of a family trust and a beneficiary. I wish to buy out the other beneficiary for five percent above market value. How can I do that?","completion":"As you say, you’ll need to consult your own lawyer. I’ll throw in a few thoughts because it allows me to share some points that I think are of general interest, but I am not your lawyer and I’m not giving specific legal advice to you. Trustees dealing with beneficiaries pose a host of issues and there are numerous ways to go wrong. Therefore, there are usually compliance issues and they tend to be costly, even if it all goes smoothly. So a trustee should think twice — maybe more like a dozen times — before engaging in a transaction with a beneficiary.If a trustee is going to deal with a beneficiary, that beneficiary darned well better be represented by fully independent counsel who appropriately reviews the transaction and signs off on it. IMPORTANT POINT: this attorney will charge for this service.Okay, let’s assume the beneficiary gets an independent counsel who enthusiastically signs off on the deal. Done, right? No. I would most likely tell my client that they’d be an idiot if they didn’t get the transaction reviewed and approved by the probate court in advance. IMPORTANT POINT 2: both the trustee’s and beneficiary’s attorneys will charge for this service. IMPORTANT POINT NUMBER 3: even with everyone signing off, there may be reasons why the court won’t approve. I recently had a case where exactly this situation happened. All beneficiaries and trustees, represented by independent counsel, agreed on a transfer of assets, but the Court refused to grant permission. The Court independently concluded the transaction was not in the best interest of the beneficiary and was contrary to the testamentary intent. IMPORTANT POINT 4: Yes, everybody had to pay for the attorneys and the filing fees, etc. even though the exercise proved unsuccessful. Once again, I’m just giving a set of thoughts about issues to consider. Consult your attorney in confidence to secure real legal advice.

If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","completion":"Lots of good answers on the imaging of atoms, but I’d like to focus on the meaning of the word “observable”. We don’t have to “see” things in order to “observe” them in the scientific sense. An observation is a point of data acquired about some aspect of the Universe. If observations are repeated and not seriously disputed then they are considered “facts” (a “fact” being defined as “an objective and verifiable observation”, see [LINKED_TEXT: Observation] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation] and [LINKED_TEXT: Fact] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact#In_science]). So, if at school, you did the cloud chamber experiment, where you fill a chamber with smoke and watch the particles of smoke moving under Brownian motion, apparently being bumped about by something small and invisible every so often, then you can say that you have personally “observed” di-atomic molecules. (When I was in school cigarette smoke used to be used, making this the only occasion when smoking was allowed under school rules and that made this experiment eagerly anticipated by about 1/2 the class, not sure if the positive effect of getting some kids who otherwise would not be interested in science outweighed the risk of getting some kid who otherwise would not started on smoking!)

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","completion":"To answer this question, let us rewind a bit and try to understand what led to this craze. In the early 1990s, India underwent globalization and liberalization which was accompanied by the infamous brain-drain. Prestigious companies from abroad realized the potential of the hard-working, highly competitive and intelligent engineers in India and offered them jobs abroad. Attracted by the fat pay check and lavish lifestyle, engineers flocked to other countries resulting in extensive brain drain. This led to the mindset that smarter kids would become engineers or doctors. The enrolment into these engineering or medical courses became a standard of validation of intelligence of the kids since the other courses like arts or literature were easy to get in. As opposed to the medical courses, engineering is a four-year course with instant remuneration upon graduation. The rewards were guaranteed within a short span of time. The internet era and IT boom in India paved way for more engineers and created greater opportunities for them. The MNCs (Multi National Corporations) from other countries began to outsource work to these Indian engineers for a higher salary as compared to an Average Joe working at a local firm. This led to the gradual rise of the middle class society who now craved for higher remuneration and greater comfort. Once accustomed to such luxury, the wants turned into needs. To ensure the sustenance of such a lifestyle, engineering degree seemed a promising way to go about. Also, an engineering degree gives the flexibility of changing career paths after graduation. Due to their logical mindset and application based approach in problem solving, engineers are found in almost every profession. To sum it up, here are some of the major reasons for the engineering craze in India: Financial securityPerception of intellectual superiorityIT boomFlexibility of changing career paths"},{"prompt":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","completion":"Don’t say anything at all.

We have to control ourselves at that time or shift to other channels to cover everything in a short time and skip unnecessary things. Electronic media is run throughout day and night and it can become addictive. So, we should watch them once or twice instead of the whole day.

As long as you are communicating and getting your message across to another person then I suggest you are both speaking and hearing the same language. The most important thing is to communicate. No one is really a native English speaker. Most just speak with confidence born of chatting away with family from berth. So my advice chat away and be prepared to listen a lot to ensure that the communication is complete. pat your self on the back and have another drink (cup of tea or beer).

If you’re talking Europe, or the rest of the world, then it’s complicated. The simple answer is, reactions to Darwin are divided between “the English countries” and “everywhere else”, based on how differently people deal with their own culture and outside imports. I think the following Wiki extract on the continental publication of Darwin’s work is one of the best commentaries on (Western) European culture I’ve ever seen: (On the Origin of Species) was widely translated in Darwin's (own) lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. (…) (Darwin) welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #JccQT]—in other words, you try to publish your book there, and everyone will try to “adapt” it to their own flavour of ethnic idiocy. And make no mistake, this is how evolution was received in those countries, even after the zany adapted translations were fixed. In England and America, evolution was “charged” because it pointedly contradicted the ideas of world order accepted by English (and none other) authorities since the disputes of the 16th century. The whole English version of Christianity—with an immutable-and-so-it-is Aristotelian animal hierarchy to parallel the immutable-and-so-it-is social order of “the society of gentlemen” and the unfortunate lower classes—existed nowhere else, and could be contradicted nowhere else, since other “religious” societies did not have those ideas in them. This underlines something that often happens: people from distinct cultures can say they understand something (like evolution, or Christian theological formulas) but actually understand radically different things, often because they are unconscious of what their own culture teaches them (no Englishman would have accepted his culture had an exaggeratedly immutable natural theology to underscore its “great English beehive” of social order; he would have just felt some vague rightness to the world being “as God intended.”) To outsiders—viz. the rest of the world—it would be received very differently, as it hit their consciousness a glancing blow from the outside, and might be interpreted many ways or not at all. More to the point, perhaps, they’d feel no pressure to react to it, even if they don’t believe in it. A lot of cultures are very used to broadcasts from the West, but treat its products very differently from how Westerners themselves do. For most of the world, Darwinism just fades into the background of things said by officious people, hardly listened to and paid lip service to in the universities. The Anglo-evangelicalism that presents the “official” alternative to Americans is even more obscure. There is no social backlash because no social pressure is felt: if these other people want to react against “the West” of which Darwinism is a part of, they’ll find more meaningful ways to do it.

Use flight search engines: Websites such as [LINKED_TEXT: travelsites] [URL: https://travelsites.com/booking-sites/] , Kayak, and Google Flights allow you to compare prices from different airlines and find the cheapest flights. 2. Book in advance: Generally, booking your flights well in advance can help you save money. It's often recommended to book your flight tickets at least 6-8 weeks before your trip. 3. Be flexible with your travel dates: If you have flexibility in your travel dates, you can often find cheaper flights. Try searching for flights a few days before or after your original travel dates. 4. Fly during off-peak seasons: Traveling during peak seasons such as summer holidays or Christmas time can be more expensive. Consider traveling during off-peak seasons to save money. 5. Sign up for airline newsletters and fare alerts: Airlines often offer discounts and promotions to their subscribers. Sign up for their newsletters or fare alerts to stay updated on the latest deals. 6. Use airline rewards programs: If you frequently travel with a particular airline, consider joining their rewards program to earn points and receive discounts on future flights.

Although I know that you should call a vet first thing). What should I prepare for?","completion":"There are so many potential emergencies that it’s hard to know what to suggest. You can get a basic first aid for dogs book. But you don’t want to paralyze yourself with thoughts of the ten thousand things that can happen either. Okay … —If the dog “looks sad” or “looks depressed,” that very often means the dog is sick or in pain. Pet owners frequently mistake this for an emotional thing. Unless the dog’s close companion just died, that’s quite unlikely. It’s almost always a sign that something physical is wrong. Ditto for sudden clinginess or sudden hiding under the bed. Inexplicable behavior changes are always suspicious. —If the dog throws up, no problem. Move on. Dogs throw up all the time for no big reason. But … —If the dog throws up four times in a few hours, OR has diarrhea in addition to vomiting, OR refuses food for more than half a day, OR “looks sad,” then take the dog to the vet. —Mild diarrhea is probably not a problem as long as the dog is bright, active, cheerful, and has a good appetite. Even bloody diarrhea may not be a problem as long as the dog’s behavior is cheerful and normal (stress diarrhea has blood in it). However, diarrhea combined with lethargy OR copious diarrhea that looks like raspberry jam is an emergency. Take the dog to the vet. In the latter case, don’t accept an appointment for the next afternoon. Tell them you suspect hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and you’ll be arriving in ten minutes. —Pacing, restlessness, and inability to settle is bad. For some dogs, it suggests the possibility of gastric torsion and bloat, which is VERY bad. —Lethargy is bad. Combined with inappetence, it’s worse. Those are the first signs of many serious problems, including parvo. —Teach the dog to leave power cords alone or else guard the cords somehow. It’s not okay to risk the dog electrocuting itself. —Exercise is your friend. Underexercised and bored dogs become neurotic, develop a lot of various behavior problems, and get abandoned in large numbers. Tired dogs are good dogs. Give your dog stuff to do and appropriate exercise. Training is nice too."},{"prompt":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","completion":"I think it gets abolished pretty soon thereafter in any event. You cannot look at the United States in a vacuum. You have to look at it as one of a number of nations in the New World which had slavery, and abolished it. The US wasn’t the first, and it wasn’t the last. But the idea that it would have never abolished slavery, or would have maintained slavery long after everyone else had abolished it, is simply unrealistic. The last country to abolish slavery in the New World was Brazil in 1888. Whether the United States could have survived as long as Brazil did in the face of pressure from European nations is a matter of conjecture. But I struggle to see any credible case for any date after 1888. I expect more realistically it probably gets abolished in about the mid 1870s. Best guess."},{"prompt":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","completion":"Although Bhutan is a neighbour and shares very close relations with India, information about the country is limited and Bhutan doesn't rank high among holiday preferences. So here's some tips for fellow Indians travelling to the 'Land of the Thunder Dragon'. Citizens of India, Bangladesh and Maldives don't have to organise their trip to Bhutan through a package with a government-approved local agent and pay the minimum tariff, set by the government. This means that travelling to Bhutan for said citizens is much cheaper, as they pay only for their actual use of services. This also means that they can organise it all by themselves, although a local agent can help much.And a guide can add much information, both on cultural tours, and especially is useful for walks, as most are without any signage. Treks in Bhutan have to be organised by a local agent, who will deal with all the logistics of the camping. DOCUMENTS Carrying a passport is ideal, though not necessary. Even a Voter's ID card is sufficient. A visa is not required either. An entry permit will be given when crossing the border. If Indian Citizens do not have passport or voter id, they can obtain an identification slip from the Indian Consulate Office by providing proof like birth certificate, aadhar card etc. The office is located in 'India House'. They take a contribution of Rs. 100 for Army Welfare Fund. Carry the photocopies of the proofs being submitted, fill up a simple application form and the identification slip will be issued in 15 mintues. TRAVELLING FLIGHTS Druk Air offers direct flights to Paro, which is the only international airport in Bhutan, from Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Bagdogra. Popular travel websites such as Yatra and Makemytrip donot offer these flights. You will need to contact the authorised Druk Air travel agent in the city closest to you (view their website for details), or call the airline office directly. Fares listed on the website are higher, for Indian citizens, they are slightly different. Also, these aren't daily flights, so when if intent to fly both ways, better to first see the flight schedule and availability and then plan the rest of your trip. Best is to let your tour operator do the booking for you. Despite being a small airline, Druk Air's service quality is quite good. You don't have any in-flight entertainment apart from their magazine, Tashi Delek, but the crew is friendly and attend your needs. Like with Indian airline companies, Druk Air offers a choice of Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian meals, without requiring you to book it beforehand. Jain food isn't available though if you need it. Catering of meals on flights departing from India is done by Taj Sats, so you can be assured of a good meal. Meals on the return flights aren't good. While travelling from Mumbai or Delhi to Paro, please request for a window seat on the left (right for the return flight). The flight path crosses by the snow capped Himalayan peaks and offers a spectacular view of Mount Kanchenjunga and Mount Everest. If you're flying from Kolkata, Bhutan Airlines, a private company, runs a Bangkok - Kolkata - Paro service. No other airlines currently operate on this route. ROAD Druk Air flights are expensive and as Indian citizens, you have the liberty of both entering and exiting the country by land. There are direct flights to Bagdogra in Northern West Bengal from Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai and this works out cheaper. Or you can even take a train to Siliguri. From there the Jaigaon/Phuentsholing border is around 4-5 hours. Thimphu is another 5-6 hours from here and the drive uphill is beautiful. Phuentsholing offers plenty of hotel facilities for a break journey. The border between Phuentsholing on the Bhutan side and Jaigaon on the Indian side is open, so you can even cross over for some Indian food if you like. But there are some time restrictions before which you need to go back to Bhutan. The road from Bagdogra to the border is not in a good condition. For travel in Bhutan,if done individually, you can either use public buses or hire a car with driver.If a local agent is used, he'll come and receive you at the border or close to it, as by agreement ( you can ask to be picked up in Siliguri, in the west, or in Guwahati in the east). You can also take your Indian Car to Bhutan and obtain a permit for the car from the Regional Transport Office in Phuensholing for a feeof about ng 200. Cost of Petrol is cheaper by about Ng 11 in Bhutan than in India in May 2014. TOUR OPERATORS Major tour operators in India.... SOTC, [LINKED_TEXT: Thomas Cook] [URL: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293844-c208445/Bhutan:Bhutan.For.The.Indian.Traveller.html], Kesari, Veena World, Cox & Kings, MakemyTrip etc. all have tours to Bhutan. Only Kesari and MakemyTrip offer group tours, while customised packages are available with all. Although, the catch is that bookings are only handled by local Bhutanese operators, so they need to forward your request to Bhutan. Alternatively you can deal with a Bhutanese agent directly.Trip reports with recommendations are plenty in the Bhutan forum on TA. For a customised package, it makes sense to directly contact a tour operator in Bhutan. There are many registered tour operators, a comprehensive list is available [LINKED_TEXT: here.] [URL: http://www.tourism.gov.bt/directory/tour-operator]. A local Bhutanese guide is not a must for Indian, Bangladeshi and Maldives citizens in Bhutan but if you prefer,to have your trip organised by a local travel agency, this will assign you a guide. Guides are professionally trained and are very well informed, they will accompany you throughout your visit and provide exhaustive information on not only the places you visit, but on anything you want to know about the country as whole. This becomes necessary as there is isn't any visitor information board at most places. Guides generally speak English, but quite a few understand Hindi and are able to speak basic Hindi as well. CURRENCY The local currency is the Ngultrum, which is pegged to the Indian Rupee. The rupee is also legal tender in Bhutan, so you do not need to convert any currency, rupees are accepted everywhere. Please bear in mind that though officially 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not supposed to be accepted, practically, all the establishments accept these notes. .Very few places accept cards, so it's best to carry how much ever you need, in cash. TELECOMMUNICATIONS You can get a prepaid SIM card in any shop on showing your immigration permit. Bring an unlocked phone with you. For a week long trip a 100 Rs/Nu card is sufficient. Call to India are charged at 5 Rs/Nu per minute. TRAVELLING WITHIN THE COUNTRY (Covering Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Phobjikha) For travel in Bhutan,if done individually, you can either use public buses or hire a car with driver or drive your own Car. If you use a local agent, you'll have a car and driver, apart from the guide. Hyundai H1 is a popular tourist vehicle, which can accomodate 6, plus the guide and driver, apart from having plenty of room for luggage. Your Bhutan registered car can come to pick you up at Bagdogra or Siliguri. Alternatively, even Indian cars are allowed into Bhutan. The roads from Paro Airport to Thimphu is good and Thimphu being the capital has good infrastructure. On the way from Thimphu to Punakha, the roads are being widened for a Hydro Power Project (as of May 2014). As a result, road conditions are bad and the road is only open to traffic at fixed times during the day. Your guide will have update info regarding these timings. From Punakha to Phobjikha, the road is in a very bad condition and can be classified as Kutcha for most of the way. The drive is picturesque, but will be painful for those with motion sickness or a back problem. All roads in Bhutan have many curves and therefore the driving is slow. Roads in the Paro area are good. There are very few (if at all) restaurants and restrooms on highways, please do not be picky. FOOD AND HOTELS (Covering Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Phobjikha) Quite a few Indian travellers are apprehensive about vegetarian food in Bhutan, but the problem is overrated. Hotels provide you with breakfast and dinner in the package and most of them will specially cook roti, dal, subzi and rice for you if it isn't there on the buffet, at no extra charge. You need to tell them in advance though. The same applies for breakfast. Do not be very picky about taste, it might not be the best, but they spare no effort in catering to your needs. Bhutanese food has vegetarian options too, if you aren't particular about sticking to Indian vegetarian. Ema Datsche is the national dish and is essentially chilies and cheese. Chillies in Bhutan are used as a vegetable and not as a spice.Vegetarian Thukpa, Bathup and Momos are other options. Shops in Thimphu and Paro were well stocked with packaged foods... juices, namkeen etc. and brands are predominantly Indian ones, so you won't face a problem finding your favourite product. You can even buy a bottle of pickles for your meals since you may find the food a bit bland for Indian tastes. But do stock up on what you need for the long road journeys, you won't get anything on the way. For lunch, there are Indian restaurants in Thimphu and Paro. In Thimphu, Chula, behind Taj Tashi serves good Indian food, while in Paro, Sonam Trophel in the main market serves both Indian and Bhutanese. On the way to Punakha, you can have Bhutanese food in the restaurant at Dochula Pass and again at the entry to the walk up to Chime Lakhang. You can read up on these places and more on Tripadvisor itself. Keep in mind that many hotels in Bhutan, including some high end ones, won't provide you a TV in the room. WiFi is available at some. Electric kettles are provided, but some places won't give you tea/coffee/sugar/milk powder. Please check up on these based on your requirement. MISCELLANEOUS DOS AND DON'TS (Courtesy: Heavenly Bhutan Travels) Taking pictures inside the alters of dzongs, temples and monasteries is strictly prohibitedTake off your caps/hats inside dzongs, temples and in front of the national flagWear full length, long sleeved clothes while visiting dzongs, temples, monasteries, schools and any government institutionsWalk clockwise while crossing dzongs, temples, monasteries, prayer flags and other religious artifactsPlease seek permission before clicking other people or religious itemsDo not give sweets, money, pencils, pens etc. to the childrenAlthough Bhutan is safe, please keep your valuable items safeThere are a lot of stray dogs in Bhutan.

Kindly refrainSmoking in public places is prohibitedBuying of antiques from Bhutan is strictly monitored by customs. Please insist on a cash memo/original bill while purchasing THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE Bhutan is really like no other! Do not expect it to provide the commercial pleasures of a run-of-the-mill Indian hill station. It's completely non-commercial and unspoilt (the way it should be). Visually, it's very appealing. Government rules dictate that buildings, right down from palaces and monasteries to apartment blocks need to conform to the traditional architectural style and the overall effect is very impressive. The people are trustworthy and friendly and ever ready to break into a smile. The mountains, forests and rivers are in pristine condition. The cities are clean and the traffic (whatever little there is) is well organised. People say that a holiday in Sikkim or Ladakh offers a similar experience at a lower cost. But no, Bhutan is altogether unique experience and well worth the extra cost!"},{"prompt":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

If the only time you touch base with your manager to get feedback on your performance is on a yearly basis, your boss will only remember a couple of the big things you shined on, but likely every major thing you fucked up. If you're not pulling your weight or performing where expected, you also wont have time to course correct or improve on your weak areas. Ideally, the more times you're meeting with your manager, means more feedback you're getting, more records of good performance, and more opportunities to ask for a change in compensation, assuming you can justify your deserving of it. The best companies do this bi-monthly or at least quarterly. Note: If you don't look forward to performance reviews, you probably aren't performing very well.. If this doesn't work out, the other thing to consider is trading up. When it's time to move on, avoid lowering you salary requirements as must as possible. Do not undervalue yourself EVER. The line I always use is really straight forward when asked about salary: \\"At my last employer, where I was a [job title], I earned a base salary of [amount I was paid annually + 5-10k], and also had [benefits, lunches, perks etc..] included. \\" It's important to present it in this manner, so they know that other companies are willing to pay for your value. Adding at least 5-10k above your last salary, instead of saying \\"My salary requirement is [x]\\" also ensures that even if they just match your last salary, you're going to end up making more at each new job. Final negotiation suggestion (for a new job only): Ask for a signing bonus that is paid upfront, but contingent on your staying for at least 1 year. This is one of those \\"we both show each other we're serious\\" kind of things, that is low risk for the company to agree to. If you stay a year, you add lots of value, and the extra 10k is only a one-time thing they had to pay (much like the fees they pay for recruiters), and if you don't stay, then you have to pay back the difference based on how many months you were there.

Traditionally, most musicals are comical, though there are many that have serious themes. Musicals are a much newer idea than opera, and are generally much more light-hearted and humorous. Opera, on the other hand, is usually song-only. There is no dialogue, the entire work is played out while singing. On top of that, opera usually focuses on the singing rather than the acting, while musical theater focuses on both. Famous operas include Dido and Aeneas, Le Nozzi di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Siegfried, etc. [LINKED_TEXT: Singer Song Writer | Famous Vocal Coaches] [URL: http://www.stephaniethompsonint.com/famous-singer-writer]"},{"prompt":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021. Is this true?","completion":"It’s crackpot bullshit. Just like “Genesis the Talking Snake” and “God’s Magic Apple Tree”."},{"prompt":"the resource curse a myth?","completion":"Yes. Resource Curse is a huge crock of shit. Never in human history has a country been poor for having too many resources. Even just saying it out loud one has to recognize the ridiculousness of the idea. The problem is not, and has never been, too many resources. The problem is internal markets. If a resource-rich country has the capability to refine and absorb many of its resources internally, it can gain lots of wealth from having those resources. If a resource-rich country can't refine/absorb a lot of those resources internally, it then must export them raw at lower prices, and thus gains less wealth. (The third option is: have a really low population and export tons of raw resources. Because of the low population the wealth can be spread around effectively. This is what the Gulf States do) I don't like to pick on countries but I think this is a good comparison: USA and Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa. In the economic space, the country is (in)famous for its oil output. In many ways Nigeria is one of the poster children for the resource curse. Given its oil production (among other things), some feel that the country shouls be more developed than it is now. One way thay people explain that seeming paradox is the Resource Curse. But look at the USA. USA leaves Nigeria in the dust as far as oil production goes, and it has done so for quite a while -- even before fracking got big. In fact, the USA has one of the largest and most diverse resource bases on Earth, far beyond most developing and developed countries. But no one in their right mind would say that America has the “Resource Curse.” Why? USA has a huge consumer and industrial base capable of refining and/or absorbing its resources. Nigeria does not. Therr are lots of reasons for that, but a “Resource Curse\\" ain't one of them. Having a ton of resources in your borders is actually great… if you have the industrial capacity to use those resources.

So the husband moves closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, \\"Rhonda, what's for dinner?\\" Still no response. Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, \\"Honey, what's for dinner?\\" Again he gets no response.

We were about 16.5 years old. I was her first boyfriend although I had had sex a couple times with other girls. We were doing some heavy petting and I touched a breast and we laid on top of each other with clothes mostly on. About a week later she called me on the phone crying and told me she was pregnant. I was flabbergasted as she had been very resistant to go much past first base with me. I blurted out, ‘Pregnant by whom?!’ She said, ‘By you silly. I never even kissed any other guy!’ I just laughed and it took me a few moments to get my composure and I patiently explained to her about the birds & the bees. I guess I embarrassed her or offended her or both as she wouldn’t see me anymore. Within a couple weeks she took up with a good friend of mine and promptly got herself pregnant for real within 6 months. They had a rushed marriage and ultimately had two kids together. After twenty years of supposed bliss, she came home one day and told her husband she wasn’t happy. News to him. She promptly moved in with a side lover.

Here, you must take the first point that Narayana is an energetic form in which the unimaginable God (Parabrahman) got merged. Similarly, Brahma and Shiva are also energetic forms in which the unimaginable God got merged. These three forms can be said as the basic eternal address of God since the unimaginable God never exits from these three forms. The reason for such conclusion is that the unimaginable God is defined as that one entity, which does creation, control and destruction of this world. This definition is given by the Veda (Yato vaa imaani...), the Brahma Sutras (Janmaadyasya...) and the Gita (Prabhavah Pralayastathaa…, Mayi sarvamidam..., te mayi...). Hence, all these three forms are mediated Parabrahman only. In such case, you can take any one of these three in the sense of Parabrahman. Narayana is Parabrahman. Brahma and Shiva are Narayana or Parabrahman only. Here, the world Narayana stands for Parabrahman only and not to the specific external energetic form. One form can never be another form just like one human being can’t be another human being since each human being has its own specific form. Forms of a swan and a parrot are made of sugar. Each item is having a seed of cashew nut in it. Now, if you say that the parrot is swan, it can have two meanings: 1) The word parrot represents the external formless sugar so that the word parrot stands for such formless sugar. When you say that parrot is swan, it means that both are made of the same formless sugar externally. Similarly, if Narayana stands for the energy present in His external form, it means that both Narayana and Brahma are having external forms made of the same common formless energy. Similarly, you can take Shiva in the place of Brahma. 2) The word parrot stands for the internal cashew nut seed and here both parrot and swan have the same internal cashew nut. Similarly, if Narayana stands for Parabrahman both Narayana and Brahma have the Parabrahman in their energetic forms. In this sense Narayana stands for Parabrahman. Therefore, you must take the word Narayana either for the general formless energy existing in external form or you must take word Narayana for the internal Parabrahman while speaking that Brahma and Shiva are Narayana. In this context, you must not take word Narayana for its specific external form of energy. If you take the sense of specific external form only, then this context disappears and the result is that Narayana is Narayana, Brahma is Brahma and Shiva is Shiva. You must learn to take proper sense of the world in a suitable context. If you take other sense of other context, the present context gets cracked with contradiction. If you take this specific form as Narayana, objection comes in the very first step that one specific form can’t be the other specific form. The one Parabrahman exists in all these three divine forms without any internal division. This concept is well explained by the form of God Dattatreya. This form is only one entity like Brahma or Narayana or Shiva. At the same time, this form has three faces of Brahma, Narayana and Shiva seen simultaneously. This form gives the meaning of the definition of Parabrahman that one entity only called Parabrahman is doing all the three works (creation, ruling and destruction) as indicated by one person having the three faces of creator (Brahma), Ruler (Narayana) and destroyer (Shiva). The above statements given by you are from prayer on Narayana in the Veda. By saying that Narayana is Brahma and Shiva, it only means that the Ruler-Parabrahman in Narayana is the Creator-Parabrahman in Brahma and is Destroyer-Parabrahman in Shiva. Here, the devotees approaching Parabrahman through the specific external form called Narayana and is not simply approaching and sticking to the external form only. If the devotee sticks to the external form of Narayana only, he is Veera Vaishnava (conservative and rigid devotee of Vishnu) and if the devotee sticks to Parabrahman in Narayana only, he is Vaishnava (a devotee of Vishnu with analytical spiritual knowledge). In any sub-religion of Hinduism and in any religion of the world, both types of devotees invariably exist. Our sincere effort is to convert the first type of devotees to the second type of devotees to avoid criticism of other sub-religions in Hinduism and other religions in the world forgetting universal peace. When you say that Indra is Narayana, you should take the word Indra in its root verbal sense. Indra means the Lord or God. The word Indra comes from the root word ‘Idi’, which means Lordship (Eishvarye). You can take any incarnation (energetic or human) of Parabrahman as Indra since we address every incarnation with the prefix word ‘Lord’. Even Brahma or Narayana or Shiva or Dattatreya can be called as Indra or Lord. In this way, you can interpret this statement as calling every incarnation having Parabrahman in it as Indra or Lord. After saying that Brahma, Narayana and Shiva are Lords, the Veda proceeds to say that not only these three, but also any other incarnation is Narayana or Parabrahman. But, if you take Indra as mere deity (ordinary soul in energetic body) present in the energetic form, having certain mystic powers along with some duties allotted by Parabrahman, the above first sense of first mode of proposition can’t be taken. You have to take the help of Sanskrit grammar-rules giving various senses for modes of propositions (Vibhakti). When you say that Brahma is Narayana or Parabrahman, it comes to be the first mode (Prathamaa vibhakti), which says that the two are one and the same. If you say that he is Rama, there are no two entities as he and Rama. It indicates identity of both as one. You can use this mode even if two entities exist and become inseparable as one. Current and wire are two entities. When I say that the wire is current, it means both merged and result is only one entity called as electrified wire. In this sense, we can take that the energetic form Brahma and Parabrahman are merged together to result in Lord Brahma. Similarly, Narayana and Shiva. Here the first sense (Taadaatmya) of merge to become single item is to be taken in the case of Brahma or Narayana or Shvia or Dattatreya or any energetic or human incarnation. Here, the word Indra can stand for Dattatreya also indicating the single Lord or Parabrahman existing in all incarnations of God. The second sense of this first mode is control of one item by the other item (tadadhina prathamaa). Salutations to Shri Ramanuja Aacharya for projecting this sense of first mode while explaining “all this world is Brahman” (Sarvam khalvidam Brahma). Similar Vedic statement exists in this context also “All this world is Narayana” (Narayana evedam sarvam). Here, if we take first sense, it shall mean that all this world is God. If it is so, bad should not appear in any part of the world. Similarly, no ignorance must exist anywhere in the world. Narayana also means abode of spiritual knowledge and there should not be lack of knowledge anywhere in this creation. All these objections don’t admit the first sense that God and world are one and the same item. This concept belongs to atheism, for whom there is no God other than this world. In order to remove all these objections, Ramanuja took the second sense of first mode interpreting that this entire world is under the control of God. If you take Indra as a deity only having several defects like going to beat Lord Shiva with his thunder weapon, cheating Ahalya, raining continuously against Lord Krishna etc., you can’t say that such Indra is God. In this case, you have to take the second sense and interpret that the deity Indra is under the control of God. Similarly, sides like East are under the control of God. In the above simile of swan and parrot a cashew nut existing in any one of these two is compared to Parabrahman. This simile holds good if you are rigid that Parabrahman is in the soul of incarnation only due to which soul can be called as God but not its body. However, this is not valid since Parabrahman pervades all the soul and external body equally as said in the Veda (Antarbahischcha...). Since God is also in the body of boy Krishna, that tender body could lift the big mountain due to Its unimaginable nature. In such case, the above said cashew nut taken as its powder mixed with sugar exists all over the parrot or swan. ===="},{"prompt":"w do you feel knowing I have your IP address?","completion":"Wow, you have a number assigned by a network that changes every time I turn off my router.

In grad school, I worked as a waitress and know that people who often left more than the traditional amount made my day, as an unexpected gift. We aren’t extremely wealthy but it’s still nice to be able to pay it forward. I’ll give two quick stories. One time, we were out on a family vacation and stopped in at a seafood dive for dinner. The waitress was very kind to my young son and we were chatting with her. It turns out it was her 30th anniversary that day and I was all, “Why are you here and not celebrating?” But of course, Saturdays are one of the best days for tips, and her husband was having some health issues. We tipped 250 on a 40 bill with the note, “Please enjoy a nice dinner on us. Happy anniversary!” and tried to leave before she knew. But my son left a stuffy so we went back. She gave me a big hug. Another time, I was at a nice restaurant, out with my girlfriends celebrating a birthday. There was a young waiter who was very kind and we heard him talking with one of the other tables as he was working his way through college. We tipped 100% on that bill, leaving cash for the tip. While we were waiting for the valet to bring our cars, he came out of the restaurant with the money, thinking we’d made a mistake. The main reasons we do it when we can is because with where we are now, we’ve worked hard and are lucky enough not to be scraping by, so it’s nice to share that with others. We can’t take it with us when we go, so why not use it to spread some joy. It’s the same reason we donate to charity and gift nice things in our local Buy Nothing group.
