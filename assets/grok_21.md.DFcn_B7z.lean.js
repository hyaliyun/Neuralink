On All Souls Day, poor people went begging and promised to say prayers in exchange for food. Apple bobbing, still a favorite Halloween game, was originally an ancient ceremony honoring the harvest time. A jack-o'-lantern is placed on porches and windows to tell children that treats are available. The legend was that a man named Jack could enter heaven because he played tricks on the devil. As punishment, he had to wander the earth carrying a lantern waiting to be judged fit to get into heaven. People believed that Halloween marked the connection between the world of the living and the world of the dead. This meant that ghosts would _ the earth on this night. Some believed that these ghosts would go back to the homes they lived in before they died. Thankfully, Halloween is an amusing night when children can dress up and get a bag full of candy.

After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.Recovering from his earlier bee attack, the stung son and some friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, who head to Marysville.

We had to take them into the actual theater . The only seats were in the back so we all bunched up around the stage . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why does some feel claustrophobic ?","completion":"Based on the available evidence from the passage, one might feel claustrophobic due to a few factors. Firstly, the concert attendees had to carry their bags into the actual theater because they did not have enough cash for the bag check. Carrying bags and additional belongings into a crowded concert venue can lead to a sense of claustrophobia because large or even small bags can make it harder to navigate through the space, and attendees might worry about the bags taking up space or being a nuisance to others around them. Secondly, the only available seats for the group were in the back, which led them to \\"bunch up\\" around the stage. The term \\"bunch up\\" suggests that they were standing together closely in order to get a better view of the stage, possibly due to the stage being at a distance from their actual seats. This act of everyone standing close together in a tight space could create a feeling of claustrophobia, as it suggests that there was limited room to move or breathe comfortably. Lastly, it is essential to consider the general environment of a concert, which can be inherently claustrophobic for some individuals. Concerts typically involve large crowds, loud music, and limited personal space, which can all contribute to feelings of claustrophobia. In summary, the passage implies that one could feel claustrophobic due to having to carry their bags into the theater, \\"bunching up\\" around the stage, and the overall crowded nature of the concert environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:The men - a Russian, a Latvian and an Estonian, as well as three others described as stateless - were given sentences ranging from 7 to 12 years. The freighter left Finland in July 2009 and disappeared after passing through the English Channel. The Russian navy said it was eventually found off the Cape Verde islands. The Maltese-flagged ship's purported destination had been thousands of miles away in Algeria. It was supposedly carrying timber but its disappearance had led to speculation that it was smuggling illicit weapons, possibly Russian missiles destined for Syria or Iran. By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow All the trials of the Arctic Sea hijackers are now over. But we are no closer to knowing what actually happened. The official Russian position - and the one presented by prosecutors at the trials - was that the ship was boarded by pirates demanding a ransom, shortly after leaving Finland with a cargo of timber for Algeria. There have been persistent suggestions, however, that the ship was actually carrying weapons, possibly S-300 missile defence systems destined for Iran, possibly weapons for Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is something Russia strongly denies. For many commentators, there is something about the official version of the story that just does not add up. Why were the Russian government so cagey about the incident at the time? Why did the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disappear for a day in September, apparently on a secret visit to Moscow? And why did the pirates choose this particular ship to hijack? There were reports that Israel had warned Moscow that it was aware the ship was carrying S-300 surface-to-air missiles. Three other men have already been imprisoned in connection with the hijacking and Russian authorities say everyone involved has now been convicted. While the court in Archangelsk gave jail terms to all six of the men for piracy and kidnapping, one of the accused, Yevgeny Mironov, was sentenced to 7 years' hard labour. Russian media reported that his lawyer was planning an appeal. According to Russian investigators, the men had made their plans to attack cargo ships from the Estonian capital, Tallinn. Crew members reported the Arctic Sea had been boarded on 24 July, close to two Swedish islands, by men wearing police uniforms. Although radio contact with the ship was lost after it sailed between Britain and France, it is understood that several countries continued to track its progress as it headed towards Cape Verde, off the West African coast. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"In 2009, a freighter named Arctic Sea disappeared after leaving Finland and passing through the English Channel, sparking speculation that it was smuggling weapons, possibly Russian missiles destined for Syria or Iran.

The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police.

Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago.

Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey. Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel. Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him‚Äîat home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother‚ÄîQuincey's Grandparents and Uncle Jack ‚Äì firmly in Quincey's life. Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Sh≈çzabur≈ç Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goy≈ç Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taish≈ç period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui It≈ç, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860‚Äì1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goy≈ç and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the s≈çsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process‚Äîdesign, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882‚Äì1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of K≈çshir≈ç Onchi (1891‚Äì1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895‚Äì1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional... answer the following question: What is the name of the specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it? Answer:","completion":"The specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it is known as \\"woodblock printing.\\" This technique was considered old-fashioned by the Japanese art establishment, but artists in the s≈çsaku-hanga movement, such as Kanae Yamamoto, began to embrace it, marking a shift in attitude towards this traditional method. Woodblock printing eventually gained recognition within the art community as a valid form of expression and an essential part of the development of modern Japanese printmaking."},{"prompt":"Q: This task is to identify the language of a sentence correctly by classifying if it is English or Telugu ‡∞Ö‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞ø ‡∞¨‡∞Ø‡∞ü‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞µ‡±Ü‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡∞ø.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: In order to pinpoint where a bra does or does not fit well, be aware of the various part of a bra. The cup: The part where your breasts fit into. It‚Äôs usually made of stretchy fabric, and can have up to 3 tailored seams. The band: This is the elastic part that goes all the way around your chest. The wings: These are the portions of the band that extend from the end of the cups to the center of the back. The straps: These go over the shoulders and are often adjustable, and sometimes padded. The closure: This is usually a hook and eye set at the center back. However, it can also be in front, or absent. The center gore: This is the part between the cups in the front. If you appear to have 4, you have what is called the ‚Äúquad boob effect.‚Äù This indicates that the cups are too small, and there's not enough room inside. This is especially apparent if you try your shirt on over your bra. If it does, this means that the band is too loose. Try raising your arms and bending backward a bit to check if this happens. Remember, when you go up a band size, go down a cup size. If it won‚Äôt, then the bra doesn't fit. This could be because the underwire is the wrong shape for your breasts. It could also indicate that the cup size is either too large or too small. You should be able to run your fingers around under the edge of the fabric. If you can pull it away from your back by more than 1‚Äì2 inches (2.5‚Äì5.1 cm), it's too loose. If the band digs into your sides to the extent that it causes pain after wearing it, the band is too small. If the band rides up, try loosening the straps. If this doesn‚Äôt work, the band is too big. This does not necessarily mean the band is too tight. Instead, look for bras that have a wider band or a ‚Äúleotard band‚Äù to create a smoother silhouette. Unless the band is causing you pain, don‚Äôt go up a band size, otherwise you will not have enough support. This could also indicate that the cup size is too small. Another solution is to wear a body shaping undergarment. This could mean that the cup size is too big, the style is wrong, or that you have not put the bra on properly. Try adjusting your breasts to make sure they are centered in the cup. This could also mean that the bra is not right for your breast shape. If your breasts are fuller at the bottom than at the top, you may need a differently shaped bra, such as a ‚Äúdemi cup‚Äù or ‚Äúbalcony‚Äù style bra. This can cause pain, and other problems. Straps that dig into your shoulders can cause long term problems, such as headaches, back pain, permanent indentations, and even nerve damage. Try looking for bras with wide, padded straps, especially if you have larger breasts. Shoulder pain could also indicate that the band is too big and not providing enough support. The support should come from the band, not the straps. If you‚Äôve adjusted the straps and they still keep falling, try a different bra. Petite women and women with sloping shoulders often have this problem. Make sure the straps are set close enough together and are fully adjustable. Underwires that are fitted properly should not cause any pain or discomfort. If the cup is too small, the underwire may not fit comfortably under your breasts. Also, your individual breasts may not necessarily be the same shape as the manufacturer‚Äôs underwires. You may have trouble wearing underwires if you have a higher rib cage. Underwires are not recommended for pregnant women or women undergoing surgery. Some medical conditions may also make it inadvisable to wear underwires. Bras without underwire can be just as supportive, even if you have larger breasts, as long as the fit is correct. Summary:","completion":"Understanding the different parts of a bra is essential to determine if it fits well or not. These parts include the cup, band, wings, straps, closure, and center gore. Issues such as the \\"quad boob effect,\\" looseness or tightness of the band or straps, and cup size discrepancies can all indicate improper fit. The shape and style of the bra, as well as individual breast shapes, should be considered when trying to find the best fit. Furthermore, be aware of potential health issues like shoulder pain and nerve damage caused by ill-fitting bras. Petite women, those with sloping shoulders, and those with unique breast shapes may require special considerations when choosing a bra. Underwires may cause discomfort for some individuals, but proper fit and alternative bras without underwires can still provide support. Understand the importance of a well-fitting bra for both comfort and long-term health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - Lad tiden g√• ( English : Let time pass ) is a 1986 science fiction novel by Danish modernist writer Svend Aage Madsen . The novel focuses on one of the central themes in Madsen 's writing - the nature of time . Like most of Madsen 's novels it has n't been published in English . This novel is a typical example of the third phase in Madsen 's writing that 's like most of his later works is set in the town of Aarhus and has several characters that also appear in his other books ( Johanna , Sverre ) . It also has another typical feature of Madsen 's books - a complicated timeline of the novel having chapters describing overlapping periods of time . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Svend √Öge Madsen (born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction. His novels are generally philosophical and humorous. Several of his works have been made into films in Denmark. His writings are extensive and has been translated into many languages.

There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui).

When Jan started to work, she missed him very much and begged God for the return her husband immediately. Everything changed with an accident. When Jan was in the oil-rig, he injured his neck and completely paralyzed. When Bess learned the accident, first she was very happy but then she started to blame herself.

Article: The unborn daughter of Tony Award-winning actress Ruthie Ann Miles died due to injuries suffered in a horrific Brooklyn crash that also killed two other kids, the mom‚Äôs lawyer said Wednesday. The actress was about 30 weeks pregnant when she was among those hit by a car driven by Staten Island motorist Dorothy Bruns, who plowed through a Park Slope crosswalk March 5. Miles‚Äô 4-year-old daughter, Abigail Blumenstein, and another child ‚Äî 20-month-old Joshua Lew ‚Äî were killed that day. This past Friday, Miles‚Äô unborn baby, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein, became yet another victim when she died from injuries, said the family‚Äôs lawyer, Ben Rubinowitz. ‚ÄúAs many of you know, Ruthie and Jonathan‚Äôs daughter, Abigail, was tragically killed. At the time of the crash Ruthie was pregnant and was severely injured,‚Äù Rubinowitz said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis past Friday Ruthie and Jonathan lost their baby, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein,‚Äù Rubinowitz said. ‚ÄúThe pain suffered by Ruthie and Jonathan is nearly impossible to fathom. ‚ÄúAs you might imagine, they are overwhelmed by the sadness of the deaths of their children.

She faces up to 15 years behind bars if convicted on all charges. ||||| NEW YORK -- A woman who had a seizure behind the wheel of her car which then rolled into a Brooklyn crosswalk, killing the 4-year-old daughter of a Tony Award-winning actress and a 1-year-old boy, was arrested on manslaughter charges Thursday for deaths that prosecutors said should never have happened. Just two months before the March crash, prosecutors said, a medical episode caused the woman, 44-year-old Dorothy Bruns, to drive into a parked car. She then had a seizure while hospitalized and was told by a doctor not to drive for one year -- advice that was repeated during two follow-up appointments. Despite those instructions, Bruns was involved in a fender bender on Jan. 20 and left the scene, according to prosecutors. And then, on March 5, Bruns suffered another seizure while stopped at a red light in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Her car rolled into the crosswalk, striking actress Ruthie Ann Blumenstein and her 4-year-old daughter, Abigail, and Lauren Lew and her 1-year-old son, Joshua. Both children were killed. \\"She didn't listen, for whatever selfish reasons, and she continued to drive,\\" prosecutor Craig Esswein said Thursday in court. \\"And unfortunately, two families lost children because of the defendant's selfishness.\\" A defense attorney, however, disputed that, according to CBS New York. \\"The defendant was given a letter by that neurologist clearing her for her regular activities,\\" defense attorney David Jacobs said in court Thursday. Horrifying video footage captured at the scene of the deadly crash shows the white car moving into the crosswalk as the unsuspecting pedestrians are mowed down. Bruns was arrested Thursday at her Staten Island home. She pleaded not guilty in a Brooklyn court to charges that included manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and reckless driving. A call to Bruns' attorney wasn't immediately returned. She was ordered held on 75,000 bond and faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the top charge. \\"Her alleged insistence on driving despite doctor's orders and serious medical conditions that prevented her from safely doing so was not only irresponsible, it was unlawful,\\" said District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said. First-responders to the Brooklyn crash said she was foaming at the mouth, confused and unsteady on her feet, and then suffered another seizure in the ambulance on her way to the hospital and again at the hospital, prosecutors said. Getty Blumenstein, who is pregnant, was hospitalized in intensive care but later said in a statement that she was healing. \\"By all accounts it is a miracle our second child is unharmed,\\" the statement read. \\"Please continue to pray for the Lew and Blumenstein families as we process the unthinkable.\\" Blumenstein, who goes by the stage name Ruthie Ann Miles, won a featured actress Tony in 2015 for her role as Lady Thiang in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The King and I.\\" It marked her Broadway debut. Blumenstein's other credits included \\"Sunday in the Park with George\\" opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and playing Imelda Marcos in David Byrne's off-Broadway musical \\"Here Lies Love.\\" She had a recurring role on the FX series \\"The Americans.\\" The crash prompted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to propose changes to state laws that would extend and expand speed enforcement cameras around school zones, escalate fines for repeat offenders up to 350, and strip vehicle registration for dangerous drivers. Such drivers could be people with serious medical conditions. ||||| Broadway star Ruthie Ann Miles is grieving the devastating loss of her unborn child, just two months after the death of her 4-year-old daughter Abigail in a tragic car crash. ‚ÄúRuthie is simply not doing well.

Answer the following question: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If mitosis does not occur, it would significantly impact the normal functioning and development of an organism, as mitosis is a critical process for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction of cells. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a disturbance in the process of mitosis could lead to anomalies and potential harm to the organism. Considering this hypothesis, if mitosis does not occur, it would directly affect the process as follows: 1. Prophase: Chromosomes would not become visible, and centrioles would not separate to move to opposite poles. 2. Metaphase: Chromosomes would not line up in the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase: Chromatids would not separate or be pulled apart. 4. Telophase: Chromosomes would not gather at opposite poles, and new nuclear membranes would not form. 5. Cytokinesis: The cell membrane would not pinch or divide into two individual cells. These direct effects would lead to several indirect consequences, some of which are: 1. Impaired growth and development of the organism, as new cells are not being produced. 2. Inability to repair damaged tissues. 3. Dysfunctional asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms, leading to reduced population growth and compromised survival. 4. Potential for genetic mutations and abnormalities due to the failure of proper chromosome segregation. 5. Increased risk of diseases such as cancer due to unchecked cellular growth. In summary, the proposed perturbation of mitosis would have severe direct and indirect effects on cellular processes, functionality, and overall organism health. To restore normal mitosis, it would be necessary to identify the cause of the perturbation and implement appropriate interventions to enable the cell to proceed through the process of mitosis as intended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: ‚Äì A British teenager struggling with an essay on an Ian McEwan book didn't get a top grade even after getting help from his father‚ÄîIan McEwan. The award-winning British author says he feels \\"a little dubious\\" about his books being studied in school, especially after his youngest son got a C+ on his McEwan essay several years ago, the Telegraph reports. He says son Greg had to read novel Enduring Love as homework, reports the Times of London. \\"Compelled to read his dad‚Äôs book‚Äîimagine, poor guy,\\" he says. \\"I confess I did give him a tutorial and told him what he should consider,\\" McEwan says. \\"I didn't read his essay but it turned out his teacher disagreed fundamentally with what he said.\\"","completion":"Title: Even Ian McEwan's Help Couldn't Get His Son an A on Essay about His Novel In an ironic twist of fate, it appears that not even the legendary, award-winning British author Ian McEwan could help his own son earn a top grade on an essay about McEwan‚Äôs novel, Enduring Love. The teenager scored a C+ several years ago, despite receiving a personal tutorial from his father on the book's themes and subject matter. This anecdote, reported by the Telegraph, raises questions about literature studies in schools and the potential disconnect between an author's intentions and the interpretations brought forth by readers, including teachers. To start with, the unusual situation involving McEwan's son, Greg, began when he was assigned Enduring Love as a part of his school homework. To say that the young man found himself under pressure would be an understatement, as the expectations for such an assignment would be extremely high considering his father is the author. As Ian McEwan himself stated, his son was \\"compelled to read his dad‚Äôs book‚Äîimagine, poor guy.\\" The author went on to acknowledge that he did provide a tutorial to his son, attempting to explain what aspects of the novel he should consider when writing his essay. However, McEwan did not read the final draft of the essay, allowing his son to retain his own voice and insights. Nonetheless, the young McEwan found out that his teacher disagreed fundamentally with the points made in his paper ‚Äì which, in a way, were also the insights of the author himself. The teacher's disagreement with McEwan's points serves as a reminder that literature and its interpretation can often be a highly subjective experience. Perhaps, the educator was looking for a particular train of thought or a specific argument that the student's essay didn't address. Or, it could simply be a difference of interpretation, as readers may approach a work of literature with a distinct set of experiences and perspectives. This subjective nature of literary analysis calls into question the rigidity of the grading system and the extent to which a student's understanding of a complex work can be accurately measured. Nevertheless, one must consider Ian McEwan's own feelings towards his works being studied in schools. The author admits feeling \\"a little dubious\\" about this scenario, as literature studied in an academic setting can so easily create a dichotomy between the author's intentions and the pedagogical expectations. Moreover, it raises concerns about the weight students and educators give to authorial intention, and the debate surrounding its importance in literary analysis. Regardless of the grading outcome, it is important to recognize that Greg McEwan's C+ serves as a humorous and enlightening anecdote for those in academia, literature enthusiasts, and authors alike - emphasizing that despite the fame and numerous awards Ian McEwan has garnered, even his guidance could not ensure an A for an essay on his own work. This incident opens up a broader conversation about the process of analyzing, interpreting, and grading literary works in schools, and prompts the wider education community to question the effectiveness of the current methods - especially when an author's own son receives a less-than-stellar grade on an essay about his father's novel, despite the author's assistance. Overall, the incident involving Ian McEwan and his son Greg sheds light on the subjective nature of literary analysis and the potential gaps between an author's intentions, readers' perspectives, and educators' expectations. It also raises valid questions regarding the current system of evaluating works of literature, fostering insightful discussion amongst academia and readers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, both series star a teenage boy and include guns, fights and world-wide criminals. The most notable difference is that \\"The Diamond Brothers\\" series contains much more humour, with many puns, pop culture references and absurd situations. Although the books started in the late 1980s and have continued into the millennium, Nick and Tim remain roughly the same age (14 and 28 respectively), while London changes with the times (the newer books feature Oyster Cards and computers for example, whereas the older books feature parts of London that have long since changed, such as smoking in offices).

Answer based on context: Coming off their win over the Cardinals the Chargers flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for an AFC West division rivalry match against the Raiders. In the first quarter the Chargers' offense had problems when after a three-and-out Mike Scifres' punt was blocked by RB Rock Cartwright out of bounds in the end zone for a safety. Then kicker Sebastian Janikowski made a 50-yard field goal. Then Scifres' punt was blocked again and returned by FS Hiram Eugene 5&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Chargers then fought back and took the lead with QB Philip Rivers completing a 19-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. Then RB Mike Tolbert got a 4-yard TD run. Then the Chargers trailed with Janikowski making a 30-yard field goal.

We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds.

We have an equation: 0 = -60 * f + 749 + 271 First, we need to add 749 (that's like having 749 candies) and 271 (that's like having 271 candies). So if we combine these two, we get: 749 candies + 271 candies = 1020 candies Now our equation looks like: 0 = -60 * f + 1020 Now, we need to find out how many times we have to take away 60 candies from 1020 candies to get to 0 candies remaining. Let's rewrite the equation like this: -60 * f + 1020 = 0 Now, we want to find how many times we have to multiply -60 (which is like taking away 60 candies) with \\"f\\" (our unknown number) so that we will be left with 1020 candies. Let's rewrite it again: -60 * f = -1020 Now, to find \\"f,\\" we can divide both sides of the equation by -60: f = -1020 / (-60) When we do this calculation, we get: f = 17 So, we found out that if we take away 60 candies seventeen times (17 times) from 1020 candies, we will be left with no candies (0 candies).

Summarize this article: Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| A recent study published in the journal Law and Human Behavior shows that angry women are less likely to wield influence over others, while the inverse is true for their upset male counterparts. According to the study's abstract, researchers set up a deception paradigm in which participants \\"believed they were engaged in a computer-mediated mock jury deliberation about a murder case.\\" Unbeknownst to the study's participants, the other jurors in the simulation were simply reading lines. Of the five other jury members in the mock trial, four were scripted to agree with the study participant's verdict of the case; one juror was a holdout. When the holdout was labeled with a \\"male\\" name and expressed angered dissent against the participant's verdict, the participant was more likely to question themselves. When the holdout juror, following the same script, expressed anger and was identified by a typically female name, study participants were more likely to trust their initial verdict and not question themselves. Anger is a really justified response to the world we live in. Dr. Jeanne Vaccaro is a postdoctoral fellow in gender studies at Indiana University and a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. \\"My initial reaction [to this study] is thinking about hysteria,\\" she says, \\"and the historical use of hysteria to pathologize women‚Äîany kind of eruption being seen as irrational as opposed to grounded.\\" Dr. Vaccaro says that the perception of women as irrational is deeply ingrained in the contemporary cultural psyche. Sexist beliefs manifest in the unconscious; people are often totally unaware of the biases they're carrying around. \\"There's this really strong pairing of the feminine and the hysterical; they've been sutured together,\\" she says. \\"Even the etymology of the word uterus traces back to hysteria. In the Victorian era they sent women off to the sanatorium to 'relax' or whatever after these [hysterical] 'episodes.'\\" Read More: The History of Female Anger The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is an internationally recognized medical tool. Historically oppressed demographics have often been classified as disorders in it. The status quo of neutral persons has long been defined by straight, white, cisgender, and heterosexual males, and the behavior of people who don't qualify as neutral persons has long been pathologized in the DSM. This is not inconsequential, as the DSM is considered to represent scientific fact about the human mind. As social justice movements progress and change society, concrete manifestations of discrimination are often the first to go. Policy and legislation reform attempt to level out inequality. In 1973, in the wake of the gay liberation movement, for example, homosexuality was famously declassified as a mental disorder and removed from the DSM. Right now, it's very important in our world that people are allowed to be angry. Dr. Vaccaro explains that it's the same with hysteria, which was declassified in the 1950s. But, she says, a change in the documentation of cultural bias doesn't mean the stereotype is gone. \\"There are other things that have appeared in the wake of hysteria. We still have the legacy that women aren't rational.\\" According to Dr. Vaccaro, some people have even suggested that the gender bias inherent in hysteria shifted after hysteria was declassified and is now manifest in the way physicians dismiss medical conditions like fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, and chronic fatigue. \\"Even though there's no longer hysteria as a diagnosis, people have said these new diseases have come to fill this gap left by hysteria,\\" she says. \\"Female patients complain of not being listened to by their doctors. These are people who report experiencing chronic pain. You go to the doctor over and over again, and nobody listens.\\" The form of persistent bias seen in the unsettling results of this study isn't exclusive to women, Dr. Vaccaro adds. Like the pathologization of difference, emotions of historically oppressed demographics are often not taken seriously on a person-to-person level, such as when the anger of people of color is written off or used against them. \\"People should and can be really angry about post-colonialism, institutional racism, everyday racism, or everyday sexism. Anger is a really justified response to the world we live in.\\" These biases are not inconsequential. Female survivors of sexual assault, for example, fear social persecution, which makes them much less likely to speak out against their rapists or abusers. Anger is a natural response to assault, but when being angry is likely to undermine your case, it's much more difficult to step forward‚Äîand thus much more difficult to move on, or share your story to help other victims. \\"Right now, it's very important in our world that people are allowed to be angry,\\" Dr. Vaccaro says. \\"Angry at the police, or angry at sexism.\\" She explains that anger is a right, and that it's threatening because it disrupts the sexist order of things. \\"It's like you're being defiant, you're being political, you're resisting the status quo. That upsets people who have a stake in power relations as they currently are. Their power is antagonized by resistance. [But] how could you not be angry?\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"A recent study in Law and Human Behavior found that anger in women is less influential than in men.

Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands. - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\" Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'record label' with the subject 'stakes is high '.

Given the question: Sydney was volunteering to build a house, and they did an excellent job yesterday. Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? Possible answers: like they should just not show up, accomplished, trying to show off The answer is:","completion":"Others would most likely feel a combination of emotions as a result of Sydney's excellent performance while volunteering to build a house. It is important to recognize and understand the nuances of human emotions and behavioral responses in a community-based project like this one. Here are some possible ways others might feel: 1. Accomplished: Seeing Sydney doing such an excellent job might serve as a reminder to others of their collective mission and a source of motivation. When individuals observe their peers performing admirably, it can inspire them to put forth their best efforts as well. This sense of shared accomplishment can bolster team morale and help the entire group work more effectively together. 2. Challenged: Some individuals may view Sydney's contribution as a benchmark to aim for. This can result in a healthy sense of competition, encouraging them to raise the quality of their work to match or surpass Sydney's contributions. When managed properly, a bit of competition can drive individuals to strive for greater levels of excellence, benefiting the overall project. 3. Appreciative: Those who have been struggling with their tasks or feeling uncertain about how to approach them can find inspiration in Sydney's work. They may feel grateful for having such a skilled volunteer in their midst who can provide guidance or assistance in refining their own skillsets. Moreover, Sydney's dedication to volunteering can inspire gratitude and appreciation for their selflessness and commitment. 4. Insecure: It is possible that those who feel their performance pales in comparison to Sydney's might begin to feel insecure or inadequate. When others compare themselves to someone who is excelling, it can lead to feelings of self-doubt and a diminished sense of self-worth. In these instances, it's important for members of the team to provide reassurance and support while reminding each other that everyone contributes uniquely to the project's success. 5. Motivated to improve: For some, seeing Sydney's success could serve as a wake-up call, forcing them to reassess their abilities and approach to the task. In this case, individuals might feel motivated to learn from Sydney and hone their skills, ultimately leading to an overall improvement within the group. 6. Resentful: Unfortunately, there may be those who view Sydney's exceptional performance as an attempt to show off or elevate themselves above the rest of the team. These individuals might feel resentment towards Sydney, even if their intentions were purely to contribute positively to the project. It is crucial to address any misunderstandings and ensure clear communication among team members to mitigate potential conflicts. Ultimately, the way others feel in response to Sydney's excellent job while volunteering to build a house will depend on individual perspectives, personal experiences, and the dynamics within the group. The key is to foster a positive and supportive environment where everyone's contributions are valued, and concerns or insecurities are addressed constructively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"When did the Arawak people first arrive in Jamaica?\\" Answer: \\"Government\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Netanyahu turns down meeting with Senate Democrats WASHINGTON ‚Äì Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday turned down an invitation to meet privately with Senate Democrats next week during his visit to Washington, saying the session \\"could compound the misperception of partisanship\\" surrounding his trip. Angering the White House and Democrats, Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican leaders to address a joint meeting of Congress on March 3 and speak about Iran. The GOP leaders did not consult with the Obama administration, which the White House called a breach of protocol. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Monday invited Netanyahu to meet in a closed-door session with Democrats during his visit. He declined the invitation on Tuesday and expressed regret about the politically fraught tone of his trip. \\"I regret that the invitation to address the special joint session of Congress has been perceived by some to be political or partisan,\\" Netanyahu wrote. \\"I can assure you that my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country.\\" Netanyahu said to meet with Democrats \\"at this time could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit.\\" More than a half dozen House and Senate Democrats have said they will skip the speech, calling it an affront to President Barack Obama and the administration as they engage in high-level negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.

Question: Something with a lot of energy travels short distances or long distances? Text: However, the energy is diluted as an electromagnetic wave travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the provided text, something with a lot of energy may initially travel short or long distances, but its energy will gradually decrease as it travels farther from its source. This is because the energy will be diluted and spreads out over an ever-larger area as the electromagnetic wave moves away from its origin. It's essential to understand that the distance that an object or wave with a lot of energy can travel can be influenced by various factors, such as the medium it is traveling through and any obstacles or interference present in its path. In the context of the given text, the focus is on the dilution of energy as an electromagnetic wave travels away from its source. Electromagnetic waves can propagate through different media, such as air, water, or vacuum, which can affect their energy and overall travel distance. For instance, the energy of electromagnetic waves tends to attenuate more quickly when traveling through denser media, such as water, as opposed to less dense mediums, like air. Additionally, the presence of obstacles, such as buildings or mountains, might also affect the wave's travel distance and energy conservation. Moreover, the initial energy of an electromagnetic wave will play a crucial role in determining the distance it can travel before its energy is considerably diluted. A wave with a substantial amount of energy may be able to travel greater distances before its energy becomes too dispersed to be of any practical use, whereas a wave with less energy may lose its effectiveness over shorter distances. In summary, while something with a lot of energy has the potential to travel both short and long distances, the specific circumstances involved, such as the medium and any potential obstacles, will significantly impact the distance it can effectively travel. In the context of electromagnetic waves, as they travel farther from their source, their energy will be diluted over a larger area, which can weaken the effect or impact of the wave at greater distances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof.

This is a baggy shirt with large long sleeves, almost always white or off-white. Think of a classic pirate shirt. Look for one made of a natural fabric like cotton or linen. You can choose a different color if you want. Brown and olive green work well. Instead of a poet shirt, you can opt for a tunic if you wish. These are long-sleeved shirts that go lower than normal shirts. Look for something in a natural color and of a natural material. You might already own some cotton trousers that will work for the garb. If not, look for some in a dark color, dark brown or black. They should be long enough to tuck into boots. Fabric is the most important factor here. They didn't have denim back then, and plain khaki pants won't look right either. Look for a light fabric, preferably cotton or linen, or something that looks like cotton or linen. Alternatively, you can look for pants that come down to just past or just above the knee. If you can sew elastic into the openings to make them resemble bloomers, even better. The vest will make your basic male garb complete, besides the shoes and accessories. The vest should be dark colored like the pants, and simple and plain. A leather vest would be ideal, but you have a lot of freedom with fabrics here, so just look for something that you like the look of. Boots will complete your look, as your trousers should be tucked into them. Look for the most nondescript, basic black or brown leather boots you can find. Something like cowboy boots will not fit in. If you've chosen to wear pants that go to the knee instead, you could wear some leather sandals instead.","completion":"In the Renaissance, lower class men often wore a poet shirt or a tunic made from natural fabrics like cotton or linen in white, off-white, brown, or olive green.

Emotionally, the individual may experience heightened stress, anxiety, or sadness as a result of feeling replaceable. Step 5: Summarize the sentiment and its components. The sentiment embodied by \\"I hate getting replaced\\", is one of strong dislike towards the idea of being replaced. This feeling may stem from a sense of insecurity, inadequacy, and the fear of losing control over one's role and place. Underlying emotions can include dissatisfaction and a lack of self-worth. The consequences of this sentiment range from a drive for self-improvement to negative reactions such as resentment and hostility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie? is inside the article: Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience‚ÄîPresley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \\"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and..., can you guess it ?

The dog's owner, an attractive young woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake. Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible.

Here's how soil can be an endless resource for a plant to expand: Step 1: Understanding the composition of soil To ensure that soil remains a renewable resource, it is essential to understand its composition. Soil is made up of a mixture of minerals, organic matter, water, and air. The minerals come from weathered rocks, while the organic matter comes from decomposed plants and animals. Step 2: Maintaining soil fertility One of the key aspects of maintaining soil as a renewable resource is ensuring its fertility. This can be done by adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to the soil. Organic matter improves the soil structure, helps retain moisture, and provides nutrients to plants. Regularly adding organic matter to the soil will help maintain its fertility, allowing plants to continue growing and expanding. Step 3: Crop rotation Another important practice to maintain soil as a renewable resource is crop rotation. This involves periodically changing the type of crop grown in a specific area. Different plants have different nutrient requirements and can help prevent soil depletion by not using the same nutrients continuously. For example, growing legumes, which fix nitrogen in the soil, can help replenish nitrogen levels for subsequent crops. Step 4: Soil conservation practices To ensure that soil remains a renewable resource, it is essential to prevent soil erosion and degradation. This can be achieved through various soil conservation practices, such as contour farming, terracing, and planting cover crops. These practices help to maintain the soil structure, prevent runoff, and protect against nutrient loss. Step 5: Monitoring soil health Regularly testing the soil's nutrient levels, pH, and physical structure will help determine its overall health. By monitoring soil health, appropriate adjustments can be made to ensure it remains a renewable resource for growing and expanding plants. In summary, by understanding the composition of soil, maintaining its fertility, practicing crop rotation, implementing soil conservation measures, and monitoring its health, soil can be an endless resource for a plant that needs to expand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. a: \\"i prefer not to infuse the distinctions into the works themselves. Make this proper case.","completion":"A: \\"I prefer not to infuse the distinctions into the works themselves.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing their preference to avoid making clear distinctions within their works. They might be referring to artistic, literary, or any other form of creative expression. By choosing not to emphasize these distinctions, the creator allows for a more open interpretation and a wider range of potential meanings or perspectives for the audience. This can be particularly effective in thought-provoking works, where purposeful ambiguity can challenge the audience to think more deeply, consider multiple viewpoints, and draw their own conclusions. One of the reasons a creator might choose not to infuse distinctions into their work is that they want to encourage audiences to look beyond categories and explore the nuances that lie in between. For example, in a literary work, the author may want readers to think more deeply about the characters and themes, rather than simply labeling them as \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" Instead, the author may leave the reader with complex character portrayals that force them to examine their own biases and presumptions. Another reason a creator might prefer not to infuse distinctions into their works is to break down barriers and challenge established norms. Artists and writers who belong to marginalized groups or who challenge societal conventions may intentionally avoid distinctions to resist conformity and facilitate conversations about identity, culture, and social issues. Additionally, by not infusing distinctions into a work, the creator can foster an open dialogue amongst the audience, allowing people with different perspectives to find common ground and debate the meanings and implications of the work. In this way, a work that lacks distinctions can become a platform for collective conversation and reflection. In summary, choosing not to infuse distinctions into a work can lead to a more thought-provoking and open-ended experience for the audience. Such works can stimulate discourse, invite diverse interpretations, encourage self-reflection, and challenge prevailing norms while promoting critical thinking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context_3 : Sincil Bank is a football stadium in Lincoln, England which has been the home of Lincoln City since 1895. Previously, Lincoln City had played at the nearby John O'Gaunts ground since the club's 1884 inception. Sincil Bank has an overall capacity of 10,120 and is colloquially known to fans as \\"Sinny Bank\\". It is overlooked by Lincoln Cathedral. Former Lincoln City chairman John Reames re-purchased the ground from the local council in 2000 at a cost of ¬£175,000.

In July 2002 there were plans to sack Walsh, whom The Telegraph described as \\"one of Europe's finest church organists\\", after differences with the Precentor, Andrew Stokes; however this plan was dropped and he was given a new role. Since January 2003 he has been Organist Laureate of Lincoln Cathedral. Context_5 : Abraham Haywood (1692‚Äì1747) was an architect who was born at Whitchurch, Shropshire and is likely to have come to Lincoln around 1720 to work for Francis Smith of Warwick on the construction of St Peter at Arches Church, Lincoln. In 1736 he built the town house of the Disney family, Disney Place in Eastgate Street, Lincoln and in 1744 the Lincoln Assembly Rooms in the Bail, Lincoln. He also built a house for himself on the east side of St Peter at Arches‚Äò graveyard on the site of the Lincoln Taylor‚Äôs Hall. Abraham Hayward‚Äôs younger brother John Hayward(1708-78), a mason by trade, also accompanied him to Lincoln. After Abraham‚Äôs death, he presumably continued the business and in 1753 rebuilt St Mary‚Äôs bridge in Lincoln. John Hayward‚Äôs grandson, William Hayward became surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral. Context_6 : William Haywood (died probably in 1823) was an architect who worked in Lincoln, England. His father John who died in 1817 was mayor of Lincoln twice and worked as a mason. Haywood succeeded his father as mayor after his death in 1817. His grandfather, John Hayward (1708‚Äì78) was also a mason in Lincoln. William Hayward's great grandfather was Abraham Haywood an architect of Whitchurch, Shropshire who came to Lincoln around 1720.

William Hayward also succeeded William Lumby as Surveyor for the Lincolnshire County County Committee, which had responsibility for Lincoln Castle and the prison. Context_7 : Lincoln Cathedral or the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, and sometimes St. Mary's Cathedral in Lincoln, England is the seat of the Anglican bishop. Building commenced in 1088 and continued in several phases throughout the medieval period. It was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311‚Äì1549), and the first building to hold that title after the Great Pyramid of Giza. The central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt. The cathedral is the third largest in Britain (in floor area) after St Paul's and York Minster, being 484 by . It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the eminent Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: \\"I have always held... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.\\" Context_8 : William John Butler (1818‚Äì1894) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1885 until his death. He was previously Vicar of the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wantage from 1847 to 1881, where he founded the Community of St Mary the Virgin. Context_9 : The Dean of Lincoln is the head of the Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral in the city of Lincoln, England in the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln. Christine Wilson was installed as Dean on 22 October 2016. Context_10 : The Old Bishop's Palace is an historic visitor attraction in the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire. When it was first built, in the late 12th century, it was at the centre of the vast Diocese of Lincoln, which stretched from the Humber to the Thames. The Palace was one of the most impressive buildings of medieval England, reflecting the power and wealth of Lincoln‚Äôs bishops. It is situated on a spectacular hillside site, just below Lincoln cathedral, providing extensive views over the city. The site lies immediately to the south of the Roman wall which had become the medieval defensive wall of the \\"Bail\\", which enclosed both Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. The palace was damaged during the Civil War and subsequently largely abandoned. During the period that followed the Bishop‚Äôs main residence was Buckden Palace in Huntingdonshire. In 1841, following the reduction in size of the Diocese of Lincoln, the Bishop moved to Riseholme, to the north of Lincoln. This proved inconvenient and Riseholme was sold. In 1886 an older building on the western side of the Palace enclosure was substantially rebuilt and enlarged in a Tudor revival style by the architect Ewan Christian. A further change occurred in 1888 when the architects Bodley and Garner rebuilt and converted the southern portion of the medieval Great Hall into a chapel for the Bishop. fact_1 : William John Butler (1818‚Äì1894) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1885 until his death. fact_2 : The Dean of Lincoln is the head of the Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral in the city of Lincoln, England in the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln.

However, they were constructed for Andr√© Jaoul and his son Michel during the post-war period. This statement implies that there was a gap between the time the buildings were designed and when they were actually built, possibly due to the war. 2. The buildings were built in 1937 but were only drawn postwar for Andr√© Jaoul and his son Michel. In the second phrase, it is said that the buildings were constructed in 1937, but the designs or plans (drawn) were done after the war. This statement is somewhat self-contradictory, suggesting that the buildings were built before their designs were completed. This is generally not how construction works, as designs are usually required before buildings are built. To sum up, the first statement highlights a gap between the design and construction of the buildings, due to the war, while the second statement is not logical in terms of the sequence of events."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Is Bloodborne hard? OPT: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","completion":"[1]. No, these two questions do not have the same meaning or address the same aspect of Bloodborne. The first question is asking about the relationship between the Bloodborne universe or story and the Demon's Souls universe or story. To answer this question in detail, Bloodborne and Demon's Souls are both action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. They share similarities in gameplay mechanics, dark themes, and challenging difficulty levels. However, they do not share the same universe or story. Demon's Souls is set in the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, while Bloodborne takes place in the gothic city of Yharnam. Although both games share thematic elements related to darkness, suffering, and ambiguous storytelling, their plots, characters, and settings are distinct, and they are not considered part of the same series. The second question is asking about the difficulty level of Bloodborne. Bloodborne, like the other Souls games, including Demon's Souls, is widely regarded as a challenging game. The game features a steep learning curve, punishing combat mechanics, and minimal hand-holding for players. Enemies and bosses are designed to be difficult and require strategy, experimentation, and perseverance to overcome. The difficulty in Bloodborne primarily comes from its deliberately precise and responsive combat system, which demands skill and timing from the player, along with the intentionally opaque story and mechanics that encourage exploration and discovery. Many gamers consider this high level of challenge to be a core aspect of Bloodborne's gameplay experience, and it is one of the features that has made the game popular among fans of the Soulsborne series (which includes the games Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne). In summary, while these two questions both relate to aspects of Bloodborne, they do not have the same meaning. The first question concerns the connection between Bloodborne and Demon's Souls in terms of their universe and story, while the second question specifically focuses on Bloodborne's difficulty level. The two questions serve separate purposes, factually and contextually, as they address different aspects of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The LSAT is a half-day standardized test that is administered four times each year (increased to six starting from the 2018-2019 academic year) at designated testing centers throughout the world. The purpose of the LSAT is to evaluate the reading comprehension, logical, and verbal reasoning proficiencies of prospective law school candidates. The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is the organization responsible for administering the LSAT, which is an essential component of the law school admission process in countries like the United States, Canada (for common law programs only), the University of Melbourne in Australia, and an increasing number of other countries across the globe. The LSAT is divided into several sections that measure the test taker's abilities in different areas of reasoning. The test typically includes the following sections: 1. Reading Comprehension: This section assesses the candidate's ability to read and understand complex materials, which is vital for success in law school. 2. Analytical Reasoning: Also known as the \\"Logic Games\\" section, this part of the test evaluates the candidate's ability to understand relationships and draw logical conclusions. 3. Logical Reasoning: This section, consisting of two parts, assesses the candidate's ability to analyze and evaluate arguments, which is a crucial skill for practicing law. 4. An Experimental Section: This unscored section contains new questions being tested for future LSAT exams. Test takers are unaware of which section is experimental and thus must treat all sections with equal importance. 5. Writing Sample: This section allows the candidate to demonstrate their writing abilities, which are essential for success both in law school and as a legal professional. Law schools take the LSAT scores into account when reviewing applications, along with other factors like undergraduate GPA, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities.

Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis in a detailed manner to further clarify this point. Premise: Two little girls play in the sand at the beach. This scenario describes the occurrence of an outdoor activity, specifically at a beach setting. It involves two main subjects, both of whom are little girls, and they are engaging in a playful activity of playing in the sand. The focus of the premise is solely on the actions and experiences of these little girls, with no mention of any other individuals or events occurring nearby. Hypothesis: Big boys riding their skateboards. In contrast, the hypothesis introduces a new set of individuals, who are described as big boys. Furthermore, these boys are involved in a completely different activity, which is riding their skateboards. The hypothesis makes no mention of the beach setting or any connection to the two little girls mentioned in the premise. It also does not provide any detailed information regarding the location, time or environment in which this activity is taking place. Given that the premise and hypothesis are each centered around distinct subjects (little girls vs. big boys) and activities (playing in the sand at the beach vs. riding skateboards), we cannot draw any conclusions or make any connections between the two scenarios solely based on the provided information. They appear to be separate occurrences that may or may not be occurring simultaneously or in the same vicinity.

Playoffs √¢¬Ä¬î Rangers Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt Use Carl Hagelin on Power Play BOSTON √¢¬Ä¬î The Rangers√¢¬Ä¬ô power play has been bafflingly ineffective, and one of the biggest mysteries is why the speedy left wing Carl Hagelin does not skate on it. He is the team√¢¬Ä¬ôs second-highest playoff scorer with 5 points in eight games, its plus-minus leader at plus 5, and a player praised often by Coach John Tortorella. So why doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt Hagelin get a chance on the power play, which is 2 for 31 in the playoffs going into Game 2 against the Boston Bruins on Sunday? √¢¬Ä¬úBecause he stinks on the power play,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said after the Rangers practiced Saturday. √¢¬Ä¬úI don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know why. I wish I could play him on the power play. Every time I put him on, he stinks.√¢¬Ä¬ù Thus began an extended, entertaining exchange between Tortorella and reporters on Hagelin√¢¬Ä¬ôs absence from the power play, with Tortorella frequently employing the word √¢¬Ä¬ústinks.√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬úI think he√¢¬Ä¬ôs too quick,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said when asked what Hagelin did wrong on the power play. √¢¬Ä¬úI think he√¢¬Ä¬ôs a jitterbug and he screws it up. But I may use him √¢¬Ä¬î I√¢¬Ä¬ôd love to. And I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not trying to be a smart aleck. He stinks on the power play every time I put him on there.√¢¬Ä¬ù It was pointed out that plenty of Rangers stink on the power play these days. √¢¬Ä¬úYeah, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs true,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said. √¢¬Ä¬úThat√¢¬Ä¬ôs why he may get an opportunity. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not sure if he will or not.√¢¬Ä¬ù In only his second full season as a professional, Hagelin has earned Tortorella√¢¬Ä¬ôs trust to such an extent that he ranks third among Rangers forwards this postseason in even-strength ice time, behind Ryan Callahan and Derek Stepan, and fourth in short-handed ice time. But on the power play, Hagelin has averaged only 13 seconds a game, 10th among Rangers forwards. That was his rank during the regular season as well. In the playoffs, Rick Nash, at 3 minutes 55 seconds a game, and Brad Richards, at 3:54, lead the Rangers in power-play time. The Rangers ranked 23rd in power-play percentage in the regular season, scoring 15.7 percent of the time. And Boston was fourth in penalty kills at 87.1 percent. Tortorella said he had never encountered a player like Hagelin, who does √¢¬Ä¬úeverything else well√¢¬Ä¬ù but not the power play. √¢¬Ä¬úIt screws me up too, because I√¢¬Ä¬ôd like to put him on the power play,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said. √¢¬Ä¬úBut he stinks on the power play. √¢¬Ä¬úI can√¢¬Ä¬ôt figure him out. I love the guy √¢¬Ä¬î as I√¢¬Ä¬ôve told the guys who cover the team, he√¢¬Ä¬ôs such an effective player. But as I√¢¬Ä¬ôve said here many times, he stinks on the power play.√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella was asked if he had talked to Hagelin about it. √¢¬Ä¬úI√¢¬Ä¬ôve asked him why he stinks on the power play,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said, by this time smiling broadly. And what did Hagelin say in response? √¢¬Ä¬úNot too much,√¢¬Ä¬ù Tortorella said. √¢¬Ä¬úHe√¢¬Ä¬ôs a good player. He√¢¬Ä¬ôs really important to us, but it just has not worked out there. But he may get an opportunity if we keep on going.√¢¬Ä¬ù If he does, Hagelin may be eager to prove he doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt stink on the power play. Brad Marchand√¢¬Ä¬ôs overtime goal Thursday was the first in a Bruins-Rangers playoff game since March 27, 1958, when Boston√¢¬Ä¬ôs Jerry Toppazzini scored the winner in Game 2 of a series the Bruins took in six. ...The former Rangers defenseman Wade Redden, out of the Bruins√¢¬Ä¬ô lineup with an undisclosed injury since Game 6 of the Toronto series, practiced Saturday but said he was not sure he could play on Sunday. Coach Claude Julien said he would make a decision about Redden at game time.","completion":"In a hockey game, the Rangers team is having a hard time scoring goals when they have a special chance called a power play.

Even though Carl is really good at other parts of the game, the coach thinks he's not good at the power play.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

The Flammarion engraving that can be frequently seen on book covers sought to illustrate what belief system?","completion":"The Flammarion engraving is a wood engraving that has become quite famous and is often seen on book covers, especially those related to science, astronomy, and cosmology. Its striking imagery features a man, often interpreted as a medieval scholar or seeker of knowledge, who is peering through the boundaries of the Earth's sky and gazing at the celestial realm beyond. Named after French astronomer Camille Flammarion, it initially appeared in his book \\"L'atmosph√®re: m√©t√©orologie populaire\\" published in 1888. Although Camille Flammarion was a scientist, the engraving itself is a more symbolic representation that encompasses a mixture of philosophical and religious beliefs, capturing the historic human quest to understand the universe and its mysteries. By examining the imagery of the engraving and the intellectual context of the time, we can discern a few main belief systems that it sought to illustrate. 1. The intersection of science and religion: The Flammarion engraving draws upon medieval cosmology, which was deeply influenced by religious beliefs. During the Middle Ages, European scholars often believed in a geocentric universe, with the Earth at the center, enveloped by celestial spheres with the stars, planets, and the heavens beyond. This cosmological model is partly drawn from the works of thinkers like Ptolemy and Aristotle, and it also resonated with the prevailing Christian idea of the heavens being a place of divine order, harmony, and the dwelling of God. The engraving can be seen as showcasing this blend of scientific and religious ideas. 2. The transition from geocentric to heliocentric cosmology: The intellectual context of the Flammarion engraving is critical to understanding its significance. With the advent of the Renaissance and the development of innovative astronomical ideas by Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, the longstanding belief in a geocentric universe was replaced by the heliocentric model, where the Sun was at the center. The engraving can be seen as symbolizing the moment of transition, where the man's act of peering through the celestial boundary represents the growing awareness that, contrary to traditional beliefs, there might be a deeper, more complex reality beyond the known universe. 3. The human pursuit of knowledge and understanding: The Flammarion engraving ultimately embodies the unquenchable human desire to explore, question, and discover the truth about our world and the universe we inhabit. The figure of the scholar or traveler on a cosmic journey to seek knowledge reflects a universal experience of humanity's pursuit of understanding. It is a stark reminder that our understanding of the cosmos is ever-evolving, and we must continue to push the boundaries of what we know and believe. In summary, the Flammarion engraving sought to illustrate a blend of philosophical and religious beliefs tied to the human quest for knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. It represents the intersection of science and religion, the transition from geocentric to heliocentric cosmological models, and the human pursuit of knowledge in the face of ever-evolving and unfolding mysteries of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Japanese government decided to postpone the event for the first time in its history. The rescheduled games were held from July 23 to August 8, 2021, still bearing the name Tokyo 2020. Tokyo had previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964, making it the first Asian city to host the games twice. For 2020 edition, Japan planned numerous upgrades and innovations for its venues and infrastructure to accommodate the influx of tourists, athletes, and media personnel. Venues were spread across two main zones in Tokyo ‚Äì the Heritage Zone, featuring iconic locations from the 1964 Olympics, and the Tokyo Bay Zone, characterized by its modern and innovative facilities. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics featured 33 sports and 339 events, with new sports such as surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing, and karate making their Olympic debuts. Another major highlight was the attention given to sustainability and environmentally-friendly practices throughout the games. This included the use of recycled materials for the Olympic medals, energy-efficient transportation options, and the utilization of renewable energy sources wherever possible. Despite being postponed to 2021, the Tokyo Olympics faced unique challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Various safety protocols were implemented, such as prohibiting international spectators, promoting social distancing and regular testing for athletes, and requiring attendees to wear masks in compliance with health guidelines. In conclusion, the 2020 Summer Olympics, also known as Tokyo 2020, took place in the capital city of Japan, Tokyo. The games, initially scheduled for 2020, were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To analyze the sentiment, we must examine the different components of the tweet and their context. Tweet: @girly_whirly Whistling for Elephants! Am hormonal, but made me cry! Liked Great Apes too. 2 v. diff books 1. \\"Whistling for Elephants!\\" This implies that the user is referring to a book or some form of content. The exclamation point indicates excitement or enthusiasm, which suggests a positive sentiment here. 2. \\"Am hormonal, but made me cry!\\" This statement reveals that the user is experiencing some emotional turmoil and that the content of the book or story likely caused an emotional reaction - specifically, tears. Although crying may be perceived negatively, in the context of a book, it could also indicate that the content was touching and elicited a strong emotional response from the reader, which could be considered a positive sentiment. 3. \\"Liked Great Apes too.\\" This statement seems to be positive, as it clearly indicates that the user liked the mentioned content (in this case, possibly another book, \\"Great Apes\\"). The word \\"liked\\" implies satisfaction with the experience and enjoyment. 4. \\"2 v. diff books.\\" This statement is more of a neutral observation, simply comparing the two books mentioned in the tweet. It doesn't necessarily denote positive or negative sentiment, merely a remark on their difference. Considering the mix of enthusiasm, strong emotional response, and appreciation for both \\"Whistling for Elephants!\\" and \\"Great Apes,\\" the overall sentiment of this tweet leans towards being positive. While the emotional component of the tweet may create some ambiguity, it is important to recognize that the user expressed enjoyment and engagement with both titles, leading us to interpret the sentiment as predominantly positive."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

This is justified because the stated perturbation (less rain) doesn't directly affect a particular step in the process, but rather influences the conditions under which the process occurs. That is, if there is less rain, it means that the second and third steps of the process (\\"Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone\\" and \\"cause an acidic reaction\\") will not take place as often or as intensively. This indirectly slows down the overall process since less limestone will disintegrate over time due to decreased rainwater-triggered acidic reactions.

Initial investments: a: Rs. 8000 b: Rs. 10000 c: Rs. 12000 GCD(8000, 10000, 12000) = 2000 Ratio of investments: a: 8000 / 2000 = 4 b: 10000 / 2000 = 5 c: 12000 / 2000 = 6 So, the investment ratio is 4:5:6. Step 2: Find the total profit We know that B's profit is Rs. 1700, and his investment ratio is 5. To find the total profit, we'll first determine what fraction of the total profit B's share is, then multiply by B's profit. B's fraction of the total profit = Ratio_B / (Ratio_A + Ratio_B + Ratio_C) = 5 / (4 + 5 + 6) = 5 / 15 = 1/3 Total profit = B's profit / B's fraction of the total profit = Rs. 1700 / (1/3) = Rs. 5100 Step 3: Determine A and C's profit shares Using the investment ratio, we can now find A and C's profit shares.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 for x.","completion":"To solve the equation -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, simplify the right side of the equation by combining the terms with x. The right side of the equation is: 239x - 111x + 50x Combine the terms: (239 - 111 + 50)x = 178x So the simplified equation is: -142x = 178x + 11840 Step 2: Move all the terms containing x to one side of the equation. In order to do this, we will add 142x to both sides of the equation. -142x + 142x = 178x + 142x + 11840 This simplifies to: 0 = 320x + 11840 Step 3: Isolate x. Now, we can isolate x by moving constants to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 11840 from both sides. 0 - 11840 = 320x + 11840 - 11840 This simplifies to: -11840 = 320x Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 320 to solve for x: x = -11840 / 320 Step 4: Simplify the solution (if possible). In this case, both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction are divisible by 40. x = (-11840 √∑ 40) / (320 √∑ 40) x = -296 / 8 Now divide -296 by 8: x = -37 Thus, the solution to the equation -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 is x = -37."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My job didn't provide me with enough money to buy a truck, because the Available options: *money was little.. *truck was little..","completion":"My job didn't provide me with enough money to buy a truck, because the money was little. It was quite frustrating, as I had always wanted to own a truck to help transport heavy items and enjoy adventurous road trips with my friends. My job, being an entry-level position, came with a low salary that only allowed me to cover my basic living expenses. I began exploring ways to increase my income or find alternate means to finance my dream truck. I knew it was an uphill battle, but I remained determined. I began by setting up a budget, outlining my necessary expenses, and allocating a portion of my income towards saving for the truck. This was a slow process, but I knew that every penny saved brought me one step closer to my goal. In addition to my budgeting efforts, I decided to search for additional sources of income. Freelance work seemed like the perfect way to expand my earning potential while maintaining control of the number of hours I invested. I started offering my skills in graphic design, web development, and writing to others in need of such services. Since these were skills that I already possessed, it wasn't too difficult to find clients willing to pay for my expertise. Over time, my freelance work became increasingly successful, and I was able to earn more than what I initially anticipated. With the extra income, I also started to pay more attention to my finances and sought ways to minimize my expenses further. I began shopping at more affordable grocery stores and eliminated any unnecessary costs, such as dining out and daily trips to the coffee shops. To speed up the process of buying my dream truck, I looked into available financing options. Banks and credit unions offered auto loans, but the interest rates varied significantly between lenders. As I compared loan terms, it was essential to factor in not just the interest rate, but also the duration of the loan and additional fees, to find the most favorable option. A friend recommended exploring manufacturer financing promotions, as they occasionally ran special programs that offered low or even 0% interest rates. This proved to be an invaluable tip, as I was able to identify a fantastic deal during a promotional period. The lower interest rate meant that I could afford a larger loan and therefore, a more appealing truck. Finally, with months of determination, budgeting, extra work, and thorough research, I was able to put together enough funds to purchase my dream truck. It was a challenging journey filled with obstacles and moments of doubt, but the experience taught me valuable lessons about financial planning, resourcefulness, and perseverance. Now, every time I take my truck out for a spin, I can genuinely appreciate the hard work and patience it took to make my dream a reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Oshun: Santeria and the Orisha of Love, Rivers and Sensuality Product review: Frankly, I've not read this book, nor do I intend to.

Possible A: close fitting, careful, compact, discreet, faithful Why is \\"discreet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Discreet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context, meaning, and requirements of the scenario presented in the question. Let's break down the question and explain how \\"discreet\\" connects with the essence of the situation and why it's a fitting choice. Loose lips sink ships: This phrase originated during World War II and encourages people to be careful and secretive with sensitive or confidential information. Revealing such information could lead to disastrous consequences ‚Äì metaphorically, sinking ships. Hence, the expression advises people to exercise caution when speaking about delicate matters. Surprise party: A surprise party relies on secrecy and confidentiality. The main goal is to organize a celebration without the knowledge of the guest of honor. To maintain the element of surprise, those involved in the planning process need to keep the information confidential and hidden from the guest of honor. A party planner who can effectively keep a secret will ensure the success of the surprise. Now, let's examine the possible answers and determine why \\"discreet\\" is the most appropriate in this context, as per human common sense. 1. Close fitting: This term generally refers to tight or well-fitted items, such as clothing. It may not fit the context, as it doesn't hold any direct relevance to secrecy or confidentiality. 2. Careful: While being careful can mean being cautious, in general, this term is too broad and doesn't specifically imply the ability to maintain confidentiality. 3. Compact: Typically used to describe something small or compressed, this term doesn't relate to the concept of secrecy or discretion. 4. Discreet: This term directly implies prudence, subtlety, and cautious behavior, especially while handling sensitive information. It's synonymous with maintaining confidentiality and keeping secrets. In the context of planning a surprise party, being discreet is crucial to ensure the celebration remains a secret until the big reveal. 5. Faithful: While being faithful can mean being loyal or reliable, it doesn't primarily suggest an ability to maintain confidentiality or keep secrets. In conclusion, \\"discreet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the need for secrecy, confidentiality, and cautious behavior in the planning of a surprise party. It encompasses the essence of the phrase \\"loose lips sink ships\\" and meets the requirements of the specific situation. Discreet party planners are adept at handling sensitive information, ensuring the surprise party will remain undisclosed and successful."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Temindung Airport ( IATA : SRI , ICAO : WALS ) is the airport of Samarinda ( from 1974 ) .

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com? Options: - not enough information - To track progress on the Russia investigation - To help Comey sell his book - To showcase democrats' criticisms of Comey and fact check his book === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is: To showcase democrats' criticisms of Comey and fact-check his book.

This sentence puts the emphasis on the process of experimenting, which defines the sound of Iguana Lovers. As such, experimentation is a central aspect of their music.

Write a text based on \\"tibetan detainees in nepal start hunger strike\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Tibetan Detainees in Nepal Begin Hunger Strike: A Cry for Justice and Freedom Introduction In recent years, tensions and conflicts between Tibet and its neighboring countries have made headlines globally. Amidst the turmoil, many Tibetan refugees and activists have sought refuge in nearby nations, hoping for a safe haven. Nepal, strategically located between India and China, has provided temporary shelter to thousands of Tibetan exiles. Unfortunately, as the political situation worsens, Tibetan detainees in Nepal have begun a hunger strike in protest against their poor treatment and deteriorating conditions. Background: Political Struggles and Tibetan Refugees in Nepal The roots of this desperate ordeal lie within the longstanding political struggles between Tibet and China. In 1950, China invaded Tibet, leading to the forcible annexation of the region. This event has since sparked countless atrocities, human rights violations, and a harsh crackdown on Tibetan culture. As a result, thousands of Tibetans have fled their homeland in search of a better life. Nepal has long been a transit point for these refugees, providing temporary shelter and transit facilities to Tibetans on their journey to India and other countries. However, numerous challenges impede their smooth resettlement. Chinese pressure on Nepal to suppress Tibetan activism and halt the flow of refugees has led to increasing restrictions, raids on refugee camps, arbitrary arrests, and discrimination against Tibetans. The Hunger Strike: A Desperate Call for Attention and Change Frustrated by limited progress and deteriorating conditions, Tibetan detainees in Nepal have decided to embark on a hunger strike. This drastic move signals their desperation to bring global attention to their plight and pursue justice, human rights, and protection from the Nepali government. The hunger strike highlights the inadequate facilities and resources dedicated to Tibetan detainees in Nepal, demonstrating the urgent need for intervention and improvement. The refugees face various challenges, including overcrowded detention centers, limited access to healthcare, and poor sanitary conditions. In addition, prolonged pretrial detentions, lack of legal representation, and unfair trials point to a broader disregard for due process and refugee rights. International Response and Possible Outcomes The Tibetan detainees' hunger strike has attracted widespread attention from international human rights organizations and governments alike. Proponents argue that their cause is justified, as their living conditions are unbearable, and their basic human rights have been systematically violated. Moreover, the refugees have been subjected to prejudice and discrimination by Nepali authorities, subjecting them to random arrests, the confiscation of their identity papers, and limited access to vital services. To mitigate the crisis, there is a need for a coordinated global effort to pressure both the Nepali and Chinese governments into respecting the rights of these vulnerable detainees. By advocating for more equitable treatment and pushing for their release, the international community can help put an end to this humanitarian crisis. Conclusion The hunger strike initiated by Tibetan detainees in Nepal reflects a desperate cry for justice and freedom from an oppressed community. As the world's attention is drawn to their ordeal, it is crucial for the international community to step up efforts to resolve this human rights crisis. By recognizing the Tibetan refugees' plight and holding both the Nepali and Chinese governments accountable for their actions, we can hopefully pave the way for a better future for these detainees who seek nothing but a safe space to call their home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Predictable plot Step 4: Write the review In \\"Unbearable Summer,\\" the movie fails to deliver on several fronts, leaving the audience feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. The storyline is shallow and poorly executed, containing more plot holes than a block of Swiss cheese. The actors, unable to breathe life into their one-dimensional roles, give performances that feel forced and uninspired. On top of these issues, the film's heavy reliance on overused visual effects only serves to highlight its lack of originality. The movie's creators attempted to paper over weak plot points and character development with flashy explosions and computer-generated imagery, but ultimately, it falls flat. To make matters worse, \\"Unbearable Summer\\" is plagued by an unoriginal concept and a predictable plot that does little more than rehash ideas that have been seen countless times before. The movie's creators would have been hard-pressed to find a single element in their film that hadn't been done better in other, more successful productions.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your story that continues the following story. In his yard, Michael doesn't compost things, while Benjamin does, so Possible answers: + Michael is less environmentally conscious.; + Benjamin is less environmentally conscious.;","completion":"Michael is notably missing out on the benefits of composting, an activity that Benjamin has wholeheartedly embraced. We must deduce that Michael is less environmentally conscious. Composting, while appearing to be an activity of simply recycling organic household waste--like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells--is in fact a powerful tool in mitigating the effects of climate change and promoting sustainable practices. It is an eco-friendly way to process waste while creating nutrient-rich soil for gardening and landscaping. Plus, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, lowers our carbon footprint, and decreases methane production in landfills, one of the key culprits for global warming. On the other hand, for Benjamin, composting is more than just smart waste handling; it is a lifestyle choice that reflects his environmental consciousness. Through this daily practice, he showcases his role as a responsible citizen who actively minimizes waste, encourages soil health, and contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While Michael's reluctance to compost might stem from a lack of knowledge or practical considerations such as space constraints or an aversion to potential odours, it is perceivable as a decision that lends less thought to the environment. Though he might be greener in other ways, his lack of composting denotes a lesser engagement in environmental sustainability compared to Benjamin. It is important, however, not to pass hasty judgement on Michael. His eco-consciousness shouldn't be valued solely on whether or not he composts. Other sustainable practices like water conservation, energy efficiency, recycling, or using renewable energy sources could just as much define his environmental commitment. But in the context of this particular storyline where composting is the primary lens through which we evaluate the characters' environmental focus, it would indeed appear that Michael lags behind Benjamin in eco-consciousness. In short, observing the characters' attitude toward composting suggests that Michael is less environmentally conscious compared to Benjamin.

(Associated Press) JUBA, South Sudan (AP) ‚Äî The United Nations secretary-general is launching an independent investigation into allegations that U.N. peacekeepers did not respond to prevent multiple cases of abuse and sexual violence against civilians and foreigners in South Sudan's capital. Ban Ki-moon's spokesman said late Tuesday that the U.N. chief is alarmed by reports of the July 11 attack on a compound popular with foreigners in Juba. The Associated Press this week reported that South Sudanese troops went on a nearly four-hour rampage through the compound in one of the worst targeted attacks on aid workers in the country's three-year civil war. Several witnesses told the AP that soldiers shot dead a local journalist while forcing the foreigners to watch, raped several foreign women, singled out Americans, beat and robbed people and carried out mock executions. Separately, several witnesses also told the AP that U.N. peacekeepers in Juba did not stop the rapes of local women by soldiers outside the U.N.'s main camp last month. The U.N. chief \\"urges, once more, the government of South Sudan to investigate these human right violations and to prosecute those involved in these unspeakable acts of violence,\\" his spokesman said in a statement. South Sudan President Salva Kiir told lawmakers on Monday that his government is also investigating the attack at the compound. Kiir also said the country's military was not \\"completely subordinate to the authority of a civilian government\\" and that the government \\"will show zero tolerance\\" toward sexual assault. ||||| FILE - In this Monday, July 11, 2016 file photo, a South Sudan soldier patrols the street in Juba, Souh Sudan.

(Associated Press) NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) ‚Äî The soldier pointed his AK-47 at the female aid worker and gave her a choice. \\"Either you have sex with me, or we make every man here rape you and then we shoot you in the head,\\" she remembers him saying. She didn't really have a choice. By the end of the evening, she had been raped by 15 South Sudanese soldiers. On July 11, South Sudanese troops, fresh from winning a battle in the capital, Juba, over opposition forces, went on a nearly four-hour rampage through a residential compound popular with foreigners, in one of the worst targeted attacks on aid workers in South Sudan's three-year civil war. They shot dead a local journalist while forcing the foreigners to watch, raped several foreign women, singled out Americans, beat and robbed people and carried out mock executions, several witnesses told The Associated Press. For hours throughout the assault, the U.N. peacekeeping force stationed less than a mile away refused to respond to desperate calls for help. Neither did embassies, including the U.S. Embassy. The Associated Press interviewed by phone eight survivors, both male and female, including three who said they were raped. The other five said they were beaten; one was shot. Most insisted on anonymity for their safety or to protect their organizations still operating in South Sudan. The accounts highlight, in raw detail, the failure of the U.N. peacekeeping force to uphold its core mandate of protecting civilians, notably those just a few minutes' drive away. The Associated Press previously reported that U.N. peacekeepers in Juba did not stop the rapes of local women by soldiers outside the U.N.'s main camp last month. The attack on the Terrain hotel complex shows the hostility toward foreigners and aid workers by troops under the command of South Sudan's President Salva Kiir, who has been fighting supporters of rebel leader Riek Machar since civil war erupted in December 2013. Both sides have been accused of abuses. The U.N. recently passed a U.S.-sponsored resolution to send more peacekeeping troops to protect civilians. Army spokesman Lul Ruai did not deny the attack at the Terrain but said it was premature to conclude the army was responsible. \\"Everyone is armed, and everyone has access to uniforms and we have people from other organized forces, but it was definitely done by people of South Sudan and by armed people of Juba,\\" he said. A report on the incident compiled by the Terrain's owner at Ruai's request, seen by the AP, alleges the rapes of at least five women, torture, mock executions, beatings and looting. An unknown number of South Sudanese women were also assaulted. The attack came just as people in Juba were thinking the worst was over. Three days earlier, gunfire had erupted outside the presidential compound between armed supporters of the two sides in South Sudan's civil war, at the time pushed together under an uneasy peace deal. The violence quickly spread across the city. Throughout the weekend, bullets whizzed through the Terrain compound, a sprawling complex with a pool, squash court and a bar patronized by expats and South Sudanese elites. It is also in the shadow of the U.N.'s largest camp in Juba. By Monday, the government had nearly defeated the forces under Machar, who fled the city. As both sides prepared to call for a cease-fire, some residents of the Terrain started to relax. \\"Monday was relatively chill,\\" one survivor said. What was thought to be celebratory gunfire was heard. And then the soldiers arrived. A Terrain staffer from Uganda said he saw between 80 and 100 men pour into the compound after breaking open the gate with gunshots and tire irons. The Terrain's security guards were armed only with shotguns and were vastly outnumbered. The soldiers then went to door to door, taking money, phones, laptops and car keys. \\"They were very excited, very drunk, under the influence of something, almost a mad state, walking around shooting off rounds inside the rooms,\\" one American said. One man wore a blue police uniform, but the rest wore camouflage, the American said. Many had shoulder patches with the face of a tiger, the insignia worn by the president's personal guard. For about an hour, soldiers beat the American with belts and the butts of their guns and accused him of hiding rebels. They fired bullets at his feet and close to his head. Eventually, one soldier who appeared to be in charge told him to leave the compound. Soldiers at the gate looked at his U.S. passport and handed it back, with instructions. \\"You tell your embassy how we treated you,\\" they said. He made his way to the nearby U.N. compound and appealed for help. Meanwhile, soldiers were breaking into a two-story apartment block in the Terrain which had been deemed a safe house because of a heavy metal door guarding the apartments upstairs. Warned by a Kenyan staffer, more than 20 people inside, most of them foreigners, tried to hide. About 10 squeezed into a single bathroom. The building shook as soldiers shot at the metal door and pried metal bars off windows for more than an hour, said residents. Once inside, the soldiers started ransacking the rooms and assaulting people they found. Some of the soldiers were violent as they sexually assaulted women, said the woman who said she was raped by 15 men. Others, who looked to be just 15 or 16 years old, looked scared and were coerced into the act. \\"One in particular, he was calling you, 'Sweetie, we should run away and get married.' It was like he was on a first date,\\" the woman said. \\"He didn't see that what he was doing was a bad thing.\\" After about an hour and a half, the soldiers broke into the bathroom. They shot through the door, said Jesse Bunch, an American contractor who was hit in the leg. \\"We kill you! We kill you!\\" the soldiers shouted, according to a Western woman in the bathroom. \\"They would shoot up at the ceiling and say, 'Do you want to die?' and we had to answer 'No!'\\" The soldiers then pulled people out one by one. One woman said she was sexually assaulted by multiple men. Another Western woman said soldiers beat her with fists and threatened her with their guns when she tried to resist. She said five men raped her. During the attack on the Terrain, several survivors told the AP that soldiers specifically asked if they were American. \\"One of them, as soon as he said he was American, he was hit with a rifle butt,\\" said a woman. When the soldiers came across John Gatluak, they knew he was local. The South Sudanese journalist worked for Internews, a media development organization funded by USAID. He had taken refuge at the Terrain after being briefly detained a few days earlier. The tribal scars on his forehead made it obvious he was Nuer, the same as opposition leader, Riek Machar. Upon seeing him, the soldiers pushed him to the floor and beat him, according to the same woman who saw the American beaten. Later in the attack, and after Kiir's side declared a ceasefire at 6 p.m., the soldiers forced the foreigners to stand in a semi-circle, said Gian Libot, a Philippines citizen who spent much of the attack under a bed until he was discovered. One soldier ranted against foreigners. \\"He definitely had pronounced hatred against America,\\" Libot said, recalling the soldier's words: \\"You messed up this country. You're helping the rebels. The people in the U.N., they're helping the rebels.\\" During the tirade, a soldier hit a man suspected of being American with a rifle butt. At one point, the soldier threatened to kill all the foreigners assembled. \\"We're gonna show the world an example,\\" Libot remembered him saying. Then Gatluak was hauled in front of the group. One soldier shouted \\"Nuer,\\" and another soldier shot him twice in the head. He shot the dying Gatluak four more times while he lay on the ground. \\"All it took was a declaration that he was different, and they shot him mercilessly,\\" Libot said. The shooting seemed to be a turning point for those assembled outside, Libot said. Looting and threats continued, but beatings started to draw to a close. Other soldiers continued to assault men and women inside the apartment block. From the start of the attack, those inside the Terrain compound sent messages pleading for help by text and Facebook messages and emails. \\"All of us were contacting whoever we could contact. The U.N., the U.S. embassy, contacting the specific battalions in the U.N., contacting specific departments,\\" said the woman raped by 15 men. A member of the U.N.'s Joint Operations Center in Juba first received word of the attack at 3:37 p.m., minutes after the breach of the compound, according to an internal timeline compiled by a member of the operations center and seen by AP. Eight minutes later another message was sent to a different member of the operations center from a person inside Terrain saying that people were hiding there. At 4:22 p.m., that member received another message urging help. Five minutes after that, the U.N. mission's Department of Safety and Security and its military command wing were alerted. At 4:33 p.m., a Quick Reaction Force, meant to intervene in emergencies, was informed. One minute later, the timeline notes the last contact on Monday from someone trapped inside Terrain. For the next hour and a half the timeline is blank. At 6:52, shortly before sunset, the timeline states that \\"DSS would not send a team.\\" About 20 minutes later, a Quick Reaction Force of Ethiopians from the multinational U.N. mission was tasked to intervene, coordinating with South Sudan's army chief of staff, Paul Malong, who was also sending soldiers. But the Ethiopian battalion stood down, according to the timeline. Malong's troops eventually abandoned their intervention too because it took too long for the Quick Reaction Force to act. The American who was released early in the assault and made it to the U.N. base said he also alerted U.N. staff. At around dusk, a U.N. worker he knew requested three different battalions to send a Quick Reaction Force. \\"Everyone refused to go. Ethiopia, China, and Nepal. All refused to go,\\" he said. Eventually, South Sudanese security forces entered the Terrain and rescued all but three Western women and around 16 Terrain staff. No one else was sent that night to find them. The U.N. timeline said a patrol would go in the morning, but this \\"was cancelled due to priority.\\" A private security firm rescued the three Western women the staffers the next morning. \\"The peacekeepers did not venture out of the bases to protect civilians under imminent threat,\\" Human Rights Watch said Monday in a report on abuses throughout Juba. Asked why U.N. peacekeepers didn't respond to repeated pleas for help, the U.N. said it is investigating. \\"Obviously, we regret the loss of life and the violence that the people who were in Hotel Terrain endured, and we take this incident very seriously,\\" the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Farhan Haq, told reporters Monday. \\"As you're aware, we have called on the national authorities to investigate this incident thoroughly and to bring the perpetrators to justice.\\" The U.S. Embassy, which also received requests for help during the attack, \\"was not in a position to intervene,\\" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters Monday. She said the U.S. ambassador instead contacted local government officials, and she noted that the Terrain area was controlled by South Sudanese government forces at the time. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said that \\"during the fighting throughout the city, the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan responded to distress calls from the compound and urgently contacted South Sudanese government officials, who sent a response force to the site to stop the attack.\\" \\"We are deeply concerned that United Nations peacekeepers were apparently either incapable of or unwilling to respond to calls for help. We have requested and are awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the United Nations and demand swift corrective action in the event that these allegations are substantiated,\\" she said in a statement. The assault at the Terrain pierced a feeling of security among some foreigners who had assumed that they would be protected by their governments or the hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers almost next door. One of the women gang-raped said security advisers from an aid organization living in the compound told residents repeatedly that they were safe because foreigners would not be targeted. She said: \\"This sentence, 'We are not targeted,' I heard half an hour before they assaulted us.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The United Nations has launched an independent investigation into allegations that UN peacekeepers failed to protect South Sudanese civilians and foreigners during a targeted attack by South Sudanese troops on aid workers in the country‚Äôs capital, Juba, on 11 July.

Is Versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the Wii Menu prevented copying exploited save files onto the console until circumvention methods were discovered, and version 4.0 of the Wii Menu patched the vulnerability. a good answer to this question? Choices: (1). yes (2). no","completion":"(1). Yes The provided answer accurately describes the Wii Menu versions that prevented copying exploited save files. To provide a more detailed response: The Wii Menu is the main interface for Nintendo's Wii console, used to manage games, channels, and settings. It is organized as a series of channels, where each channel represents an application, game, or utility. Along with the ability to manage save data, the Wii Menu also enforces the console's security features and prevents unauthorized modifications. Exploited save files are essentially game saves that have been modified to include a vulnerability or exploit that can be used to \\"soft-mod\\" the console, allowing for the execution of unofficial software. Some examples of these modified game saves include Bannerbomb, Indiana Pwns, and Twilight Hack which are known to exploit a vulnerability in the Wii's system software. Version 3.3 of the Wii Menu was released in June 2008 and attempted to limit the copying of exploited save files onto the console. This version came with increased save file integrity checks and blocked specific save files known to contain exploits, such as the Twilight Hack. However, it wasn't very effective in stopping determined users, as new exploits were quickly discovered. Version 3.4, which was released in late November 2008, included even tighter restrictions on save file copying and further refined the measures to block exploited save files. It was more effective than the previous update, but it was still possible for users to find ways to bypass these security measures. Finally, version 4.0 of the Wii Menu, released in March 2009, effectively patched the vulnerabilities that had been exploited in previous versions. It included a stronger save data check and prevented the use of well-known exploits at the time. However, this version also introduced new features such as the System Menu IOS, which inadvertently led to new methods for exploiting the console. In summary, versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the Wii Menu introduced measures to prevent copying exploited save files onto the console, while version 4.0 aimed to fully patch the vulnerability. Despite these efforts, determined users were able to find new ways to bypass these security measures, which led to an ongoing battle between console security and users seeking to \\"soft-mod\\" their Wii consoles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Secret protocols in the new agreement modified the \\"Secret Additional Protocols\\" of the German‚ÄìSoviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, ceding the Lithuanian Strip to the Soviet Union in exchange for 7.5 million dollars (31.5 million Reichsmark). The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka river and the Baltic Sea. It also extended trade regulation of the 1940 German‚ÄìSoviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic States now occupied by the Soviets and other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within two and a half months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories, and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and \\"White Russian\\" \\"nationals\\" in German-held territories.

As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island had more small-beaked birds die? A:","completion":"A: Bank island had more small-beaked birds die. In the background article, it is mentioned that during a drought, fewer seeds are available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks can only crack open and eat smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks can crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died during the drought. In your new situation, Bank island is experiencing a severe drought, which means a decline in available seeds. Therefore, it is likely that more small-beaked birds died on Bank island in comparison to Port island, which had wet weather and presumably a more stable food supply for the birds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

William II (Old Norman: Williame; c. 1056 - 2 August 1100), the third son of William the Conqueror, was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life. William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma, or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the Curia Regis, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated. In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm III's brother Donald seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar AEtheling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court. William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier. In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks--a sum equalling about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death. As regent for his brother Robert in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade Aquitaine at the time of his death. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do this for","completion":"William Rufus, also known as William II, undertook various actions and campaigns during his reign.

In return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equaled about a quarter of William's annual revenue, Robert pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William.

Q:I can use this background: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. Now, I have a new situation: Alexiev and Sabrina were enthusiastic chemistry students completing the first experiment of their new course. They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures. Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture. Answer this question please: Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? A:","completion":"Sabrina's mixture has a higher pH value at the end of the experiment. Based on the background information provided, a solution with a higher concentration of hydronium ions has a pH lower than 7 and is considered acidic. In contrast, a lower concentration of hydronium ions represents a less acidic or more alkaline solution. Since Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present in his mixture, his solution would have a lower pH value and would be more acidic. On the other hand, Sabrina's mixture had a low concentration of hydronium ions, which means her solution would be less acidic and have a higher pH value. Recall that the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (pure water). Solutions with pH values lower than 7 are considered acidic, while solutions with pH values higher than 7 are considered alkaline or basic. In their chemistry experiment, the students started with pure water (pH 7) and subjected it to different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. Alexiev's water became more acidic, thus decreasing its pH value, while Sabrina's water either remained neutral or became less acidic, thus resulting in a higher pH value in comparison to Alexiev's mixture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stomp to launch.","completion":"Title: Stomp Rockets: A Fun and Educational DIY Project for Kids and Adults Alike Introduction Who says learning about science can't be a fun and exciting adventure? With just a few simple materials and a little creativity, you can create your own stomp rocket launcher that teaches about the principles of physics while providing hours of entertainment for children and adults alike. In this article, we will discuss the mechanics behind stomp rockets, the materials needed to create your own rocket launcher, and how to successfully launch your rocket with a powerful stomp. What are Stomp Rockets and How Do They Work? A stomp rocket is a toy that uses air pressure to propel itself into the air. The basic idea behind a stomp rocket is to have a small rocket that can be launched by applying force, typically with a simple stomp of the foot, onto an air chamber connected to a launching tube. The force applied by the stomp compresses the air in the chamber, and the compressed air is forced through the launching tube, propelling the rocket into the sky. The fundamentals of stomp rocket science are rooted in the principles of physics, specifically Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of the stomp rocket launcher, the action is the force applied by your foot, while the reaction is the rocket's propulsion into the air. Materials Needed to Build a Stomp Rocket Launcher To create your own stomp rocket launcher, you'll need the following materials: 1. A 1-liter plastic bottle (such as a soda bottle) 2. A length of PVC pipe (about ¬Ω inch diameter, approximately 2 feet long) 3. A foam rocket (available at most toy stores, or you can create your own using foam balls and paper) 4. Duct tape or electrical tape Assembly Instructions 1. First, attach the PVC pipe to the opening of the 1-liter bottle using duct tape or electrical tape. Ensure that the pipe is held securely in place by wrapping the tape around both the pipe and the neck of the bottle several times. The pipe should be securely fastened so that it is air-tight. 2. Next, slide your foam rocket onto the top end of the PVC pipe. Make sure that the rocket is not too tight or too loose, as this will impact the launch's success. If you are using a store-bought rocket, it should fit snuggly onto the pipe. For a homemade rocket, you may need to adjust the size of the hole in the foam ball to fit the pipe correctly. Preparing for Launch Now that your stomp rocket launcher is complete, you're ready for take-off! Follow these steps for a successful launch: 1. Find a suitable launch location with ample space. An open field or a large, unobstructed backyard are ideal spots. 2. Place the launcher on the ground, with the bottle flat on the ground and the connected PVC pipe angling upwards to your desired launch angle. 3. Make sure the surrounding area is clear of any obstacles or people who may be injured by the rocket's trajectory. 4. When you're ready to launch, take a strong step or stomp onto the 1-liter bottle with your foot. The force from your stomp will compress the air inside the bottle, and the compressed air will propel the rocket off the PVC pipe and into the air. 5. Retrieve your rocket, reset the launcher, and prepare for another exciting launch! Conclusion Stomp rockets are not only a fun and enjoyable activity for people of all ages, but they also demonstrate fundamental scientific principles in action. By building your own stomp rocket launcher and experiencing the thrill of launching the rockets, children and adults can gain an appreciation for the science behind the fun. So gather your materials, assemble your launcher, and start stomping your way to the skies with this educational and exhilarating DIY project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Question: How did Benjamin Franklin's anonymous letter in 1784 propose to conserve candles and take advantage of natural sunlight in Paris? Explain the suggested measures and discuss how the context of timekeeping in 18th-century Europe differed from the standardized times that emerged later on due to advances in rail and communication networks. Answer: In 1784, Benjamin Franklin, an American envoy to France, anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians could economize on their consumption of candles by rising earlier to make use of morning sunlight. This was consistent with his famous adage, \\"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\\" In his satirical letter, Franklin proposed several measures aimed at encouraging people to wake up earlier and make use of natural light. These included taxing shutters, rationing candles, ringing church bells, and firing cannons at sunrise. However, it is essential to note that Franklin did not suggest the implementation of Daylight Saving Time (DST) at that time, as many people commonly believe. In the context of 18th-century Europe, precise schedules and standardized times were not prevalent, unlike today's world, where timekeeping depends on synchronization across geographical and communication networks. Advances in rail and communication systems later forced the need for standardization in timekeeping, marking a notable departure from the relatively imprecise timekeeping that characterized Franklin's era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills).

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut‚Äînicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"‚Äîwas improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Renee immediately takes a liking to Webster and flirts with him.Webster doesn't have to wait long for trial, and he's escorted to the saloon to meet with the judge. Renee goes along and Webster calls her \\"Freckle Face,\\" which irritates her. Judge Gannon asks him who he shot. Webster explains it was two men who took it upon themselves to combine his herd with theirs. The judge agrees that was justified, so he dismisses the case, but he also tells Webster his cows are being confiscated for disturbance of the peace, among other things. Webster wants to take issue with that, but he realizes he's badly outnumbered, and justice usually goes to the strongest at the time.The owner of the saloon, a woman named Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), asks the judge why he confiscated Webster's cattle. \\"Because I wanted them,\\" he says.Webster and Tatum decide to make for the Klondike, even though they lost their cattle, and begin making preparations.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Statistically, you are more likely to hit a ship if you aim for the center of the board, so start there. The four by four squares in the middle of the board are likely to contain a carrier ship or battleship. Imagine the board as a checkerboard, where half the squares are dark and half are light. Each ship covers at least two squares, meaning every ship must touch a dark square. Therefore, if you fire randomly at only even squares or only odd squares, you will minimize the number of turns you need to hit every ship. Once you have a hit, you will cease firing randomly and commence targeting the ship in question. To keep track of the light and dark squares, look at your own board and imagine that the diagonal line of squares from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is dark. Imagine the squares from the to right corner to the bottom left corner are light. You can count out from there to ensure each square you're targeting is the right color. If you strike out twice when firing, try firing into a different segment of the board. The chances that you just missed a ship are lower than the chances that you missed by a wide margin.","completion":"In order to maximize your chances of hitting a ship in the game of Battleship, there are a few strategic methods you can employ. First and foremost, focusing your efforts on the center of the board is statistically the most effective approach, as the 4x4 central squares are more likely to contain larger ships such as the carrier and battleship. To further optimize your strategy, you can visualize the board as a checkerboard with an alternating pattern of dark and light squares. Because every ship occupies at least two squares, it's guaranteed that each ship will be in contact with at least one dark square. By only firing at even or odd squares, you can significantly reduce the number of turns needed to hit all ships on the board. Once you've successfully hit a ship, shift your approach from random firing to targeted firing, aiming to hit and subsequently sink the discovered ship. To help visualize the light and dark squares, mentally draw diagonal lines from the top left to bottom right corner and from the top right to bottom left corner of your own game board. By counting outward from these lines, you can easily determine which squares to target with your shots. However, if you happen to miss the target twice in a row, it's advisable to switch to a different segment of the board. The probability of narrowly missing a ship is fairly low, so it's more likely that you missed by a larger margin. By focusing on another area, you increase your chances of finding and hitting an opponent's ship. In summary, begin by targeting the center of the board, then use the checkerboard logic to maximize efficiency, and adjust your strategy once you've hit a ship. If you're frequently missing your shots, switch to a different area of the board and keep employing these strategic techniques to increase your chances of winning the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Description of the cage and box The cage was larger and more spacious, which allowed the rodents to move around freely and comfortably. It had ample space for them to play, explore, and rest. The cage was equipped with water bottles, food dispensers, and some toys for the rodents to interact with. In contrast, the box was smaller and more cramped. It limited the rodents' movement and did not provide much room for them to roam or play. The box had minimal amenities, like a small water dish and a limited supply of food. Step 3: Rodents' preference for the cage The rodents naturally preferred the cage due to its spaciousness and amenities.

The rodents in the box, meanwhile, experienced stress and discomfort due to the restricted space and limited resources, which led to a decrease in their overall wellbeing and happiness. Step 4: Introduce potential conflict or problem. One day, the owner of the rodents decided to clean both the cage and the box. While he was preoccupied with preparing the cleaning supplies, a few rodents from the box cunningly escaped their confinements and attempted to sneak into the cage, seeking a better life among their more fortunate companions.

Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"The answer to your question \\"What Jews are not Sephardic or Mizrahi?\\" would be Ashkenazi Jews. Ashkenazi Jews are distinct from Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews who primarily descend from Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, and the Middle East. Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, are a Jewish ethnic group who have their earliest ancestors from the medieval Jewish communities of the regions of Alsace and Rhineland, in modern-day Western Germany and Northern France. In the late Middle Ages, due to religious persecution and economic hardship, they began to spread eastwards into other parts of Europe, including Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Hungary, hence forming large, segregated communities known as Shtetls. In terms of population size, it's estimated that Ashkenazi Jews accounted for 92 percent of the world's Jews at their peak in 1931. Accordingly, even today, they form a substantial part of the Jewish population worldwide, with estimates oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million, which makes up less than 74% to about 75% of Jews worldwide.

Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM. Louis van Gaal is unlikely to get carried away by the fact that Manchester United touched down in England with the Guinness International Cup in their possession. The Dutchman is experienced enough to know that victories like the one over Liverpool in the final in Miami might score a few points with the supporters but are worth very little else. There are far bigger tests to come. However, the manager he defeated at the Sun Life Stadium believes the new United boss might still be in for a rude awakening when the new Premier League season starts a week on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training. Looking good: Wayne Rooney scored in the win over Liverpool in Miami. Brendan Rodgers warned that Van Gaal will not have experienced the type of intense competition inherent to English football during his spells in charge at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax, in countries where one or two clubs routinely dominate. Van Gaal has won titles at all three clubs in Spain, Germany and Holland. But Rodgers believes he will have a battle on his hands to add the Premier League to that list. ‚ÄòI think he‚Äôll find the competition in this league will be different to any other league that he‚Äôs worked in,‚Äô said the Liverpool boss. ‚ÄòIn a lot of the other leagues, there are one or two teams and those are the teams that are expected to win. Silver lining: Darren Fletcher and Rooney celebrate with the Guinness International Champions Cup. Ajax (Sept, 1991) The Dutch powerhouses had won only one of the previous six league titles but Van Gaal, in his first managerial post, went on to win a hat-trick of titles, a Champions League trophy and a UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona (July, 1997) Taking over from Bobby Robson, Van Gaal won two back-to-back league titles and a Copa del Rey. AZ Alkmaar (July, 2005) Alkmaar had established a reputation as a solid, mid-table club. Van Gaal mounted a title challenge in his first season and after an 11th-placed blip in 2007-08, won their first title in 28 years. ‚ÄòThis is a league where the top team plays the bottom team and on any given day you can lose. ‚ÄòI think the competition will probably take him by (surprise), and that‚Äôs from foreign managers I have spoken to over the years. 'I‚Äôve worked closely with foreign players, and that real physical competitive nature will be different to anywhere else he‚Äôs worked before.‚Äô Liverpool certainly did their best to emphasise the point in Miami. Steven Gerrard put them ahead from the penalty spot and last season‚Äôs runners-up could have been more goals to the good before United hit back to win 3-1 with second-half strikes from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard. It means Van Gaal won all five games on tour, albeit beating Inter Milan on penalties. When Rodgers‚Äô comments were put to the United boss, he responded with the smile of a man who knows what to expect. All together: Juan Mata is mobbed by his teammates after his goal. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements. Touching down: Louis van Gaal arrives back in Manchester after winning in America. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here,‚Äô said Van Gaal. ‚ÄòOK maybe he is right because I have to experience that, but I was also in Spain and in my first year I won three titles. In Germany I won two titles. If I win one here, we will all be happy.‚Äô Asked the value of winning the tournament, he replied: ‚ÄòNothing. It‚Äôs nice for the fans in the USA ‚Äî also at home ‚Äî that we beat Liverpool. It‚Äôs not our favourite opponent, I think, for Man United fans. We‚Äôve given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that‚Äôs very important. ‚ÄòOf course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose. But the most important game is Swansea at home in the first game, that‚Äôs the one we have to win.‚Äô As well as managing two top clubs in close proximity to one another, Van Gaal and Rodgers also work under American owners. Although the Northern Irishman spoke of his respect for his new rival and his belief that United will be title challengers again this season, he still believes Van Gaal‚Äôs predecessor David Moyes was let down by the Glazers during his ill-fated season in charge at Old Trafford. ‚ÄòI think there were a lot of things at Manchester United that were not seen by many,‚Äô said Rodgers. ‚ÄòDavid had to go in and where I felt for him is that he thought he was getting time. He signed a long-term deal and thought he had that longevity. It just shows you. You have to win games and hopefully then you get the chance. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm very fortunate here. I‚Äôve got brilliant owners. I‚Äôve been clear in terms of how I‚Äôve wanted to work and I‚Äôve been able to work.‚Äô Warning: Brendan Rodgers says Louis van Gaal will find managing Manchester United tough. Asked if United can emulate Liverpool by recovering from a seventh-place finish to challenge for the title again, Rodgers said: ‚ÄòI think it will be a totally different mindset. Domestically, for the last 20 years they‚Äôve been champions 13 times. So they already have something in place. When I came to Liverpool, we were eighth at the time and the club was nearly going out of business, so it‚Äôs totally different. ‚ÄòThe United players will be disappointed with where they finished last year, of course. With the quality they have, they will want to push on.‚Äô What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are as follows: 1.

Q: Context: Classical strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Typhimurium) predominantly cause a self-limiting diarrheal illness in humans and a systemic disease in mice. In this study, we report the characterization of a strain isolated from a blood-culture taken from a 15-year old woman suffering from invasive severe salmonellosis, refractory to conventional therapy with extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC).', 'The strain, named 33676, was characterized as multidrug-resistant Salmonella serogroup A by biochemical, antimicrobial and serological tests. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and XbaI macrorestrictions (PFGE) showed that strain 33676 belonged to the Typhimurium ST213 genotype, previously described for other Mexican Typhimurium strains. PCR analyses revealed the presence of IncA/C, IncFIIA and ColE1-like plasmids and the absence of the Salmonella virulence plasmid (pSTV). Conjugation assays showed that the ESC-resistance gene bla CMY-2 was carried on the conjugative IncF plasmid, instead of the IncA/C plasmid, as found in previously studied ST213 strains. Although the IncA/C plasmid conferred most of the observed antimicrobial resistances it was not self-conjugative; it was rather able to conjugate by co-integrating with the IncF plasmid. Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections. Both type-three secretion system (T3SS), encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2), were functional in the 33676 strain and, interestingly, this strain produced the H2 FljB flagellin instead of the H1 FliC flagellin commonly expressed by S. enterica strains.Question: Is a multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium ST213 human-invasive strain ( 33676 ) containing the bla CMY-2 gene on an IncF plasmid attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice? A:","completion":"Part #1: Generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Usage: \\"Is a multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium ST213 human-invasive strain (33676) containing the bla CMY-2 gene on an IncF plasmid attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice?\\" Sample response: Yes, strain 33676 is attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice. This meets the criteria because the context directly states that \\"Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections.\\" Part #2: Use the context to support the generated answer. Usage: Context: \\"Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections.\\" Sample response: The context reveals that strain 33676 was studied and found to be fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections, indicating that the strain is not as harmful in mice as it is in humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who does Candy return to? Movie plot title: Candy Movie plot: Candy (Abbie Cornish) is a beautiful young lady with a lot of potential who falls in love with a charming, young, aspiring poet (Heath Ledger) and his beatnik lifestyle- which includes drugs. Before too long, both of them are wrapped up in the druggie lifestyle. What starts off as harmless fun and pleasure ends up as pain and misery. Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal. This is ultimately a very sad story with a bittersweet ending. Dan's devotion to Candy is shown when the two suffer through horrible heroin withdrawal only to decide that they cannot quit the drug cold turkey and turn to methadone. Dan moves them to the country and takes on some menial labor jobs for money to put food on the table. Candy doesn't work and soon becomes more and more depressed and lonely; hanging out and smoking pot with a neighbor. Her behavior becomes more and more erratic and before long she flees the country. It's a heartbreaking scene, when Dan comes home from a hard day of work to find the place trashed and Candy gone, words written in lipstick on the walls. He falls apart. He's despondent and turns back to drugs. He goes to see his mentor and father figure, Casper (Geoffrey Rush), who has developed a drug more potent and cheaper than heroin; but when he arrives there he finds his friend has overdosed. This is a powerful moment in the film and this is where Ledger is at his best, quietly conveying his complete emotional devastation. He's lost the girl he loves and his best friend. He's hit rock bottom. He gets a dishwashing job and manages to stay clean; still thinking about Candy and still writing his poetry on breaks. Eventually the day comes when a...

Article: If you ask someone why he or she wears clothes, the answer will probably be \\"to keep warm and to cover my body\\". These are the basic reasons why clothes are worn, but people also want to look attractive and appear successful to others. If people only wore clothes for warmth and to cover their bodies, most clothes would be simple and cheap. In most Western countries, however, clothes are sometimes very expensive. The main reason for this is not the cost of the cloth or the cost of making the clothes. The clothes are expensive because of fashion . Successful businessmen, for example, often wear very expensive suits, shirts and ties. Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars for a suit and hundreds of dollars for a tie. It's just a suit and a tie but they pay these prices because of the famous name of the designer. A suit costing much less would be just as warm and would cover the wearer's body just as well. Fashion is always changing, which means those who want to be fashionable have to buy new clothes every few months, even if last month's clothes have only been worn once or twice. Some people have wardrobes full of clothes that have hardly been worn but are no longer in fashion. Being fashionable, therefore, can be a very expensive pastime !

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:You are given a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. and a hint : During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. Please answer this question : Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? A:","completion":"Considering the information provided, Jennifer would likely see more red sunsets in Malarn as compared to Trainlan. Since Malarn gets a large amount of dust in the air from the desert located across the ocean, it shares similarities with areas affected by the Sahara dust, such as Florida and the Caribbean. During mid-summer, these areas experience an increase in dust transport, leading to rainfall suppression and a change in the sky's appearance from blue to white. This, in turn, results in an increase in red sunsets. The presence of airborne dust particulates in Malarn negatively impacts air quality, but these dust events create conditions that are conducive to the increased frequency of red sunsets. On the other hand, no specific information about the dust situation or sunsets in Trainlan is provided. Nevertheless, as Trainlan is not mentioned to have similar high dust conditions, it can be inferred that it may have fewer red sunsets as compared to Malarn. In conclusion, Jennifer is likely to see more red sunsets in Malarn due to the high concentration of dust in the air, whereas in Trainlan, dust conditions are not specified, and hence, the frequency of red sunsets there would likely be lesser as compared to Malarn. It is important to note, however, that other factors such as personal preferences, lifestyle, and seasonal changes may also influence Jennifer's overall experience of sunsets in each city."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information: - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Introducing The Beau Brummels is the debut album by American pop rock band the Beau Brummels. It was produced by Sly Stone, lead singer of Sly & the Family Stone. Unlike with most other debut albums of the era, ten of the twelve songs on this album are originals. The album peaked at number 24 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" 200 albums chart in 1965. - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock. - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion. - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution. - Sal Valentino (born Salvatore Willard Spampinato, September 8, 1942) is an American rock musician, singer and songwriter, best known as lead singer of The Beau Brummels, subsequently becoming a songwriter as well. The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little.\\" He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, \\"Every Now and Then\\", in 2008. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - \`\` Just a Little '' is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels . The song is included on the band 's debut album , Introducing the Beau Brummels , and was released as its second single , following \`\` Laugh , Laugh '' . \`\` Just a Little '' became the band 's highest - charting U.S. single , peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1965 .

Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll (mainly Chuck Berry guitar style and the midtempo beat of artists like Buddy Holly), doo-wop, skiffle and R&B. The genre provided many of the bands responsible for the British Invasion of the American pop charts starting in 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, including the format of the rock group around lead, rhythm and bass guitars with drums. - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels, written by guitarist Ron Elliott and produced by Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone. Released in December 1964 as the band's debut single, the song reached number 15 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart the following February. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was the first hit single to come out of the emerging San Francisco music scene in response to the British Invasion. The song was later included on the band's first full-length album, \\"Introducing the Beau Brummels\\", released in April 1965. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. - Autumn Records was a 1960s San Francisco-based pop record label.

Given the question: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Ch√¢telier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","completion":"Test C would see lower concentration of the reactants than Test D.

For me Born Again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl.

Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story.

Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fianc√É¬©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Dear Mr. Wolfson, The purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator . I have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it. I thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event! I urge you to correct that omission now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community. Sincerely, Linda Sullivan Question: What can we learn about Mr.Wolfson from the letter? Options: A: He knows Linda quite well. B: He is a careless person. C: He tries something to reward those who have done much community service. D: He tries his best to find Elizabeth and do something to reward her.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information.

What is the best way to stop feeling wrong about being a single girl who is successful but yearns for a good relationship? It is important to understand that there is nothing wrong with being a single and successful woman who wants a fulfilling relationship. Society may sometimes pressure people to conform to certain expectations regarding relationships and success, but you are allowed to define happiness and satisfaction for yourself. Here are some suggestions for embracing your current status and overcoming any feelings of inadequacy: a. Recognize your accomplishments: Acknowledge your professional achievements and personal growth. This will help boost your self-esteem and remind you that you have worked hard to reach where you are today. b. Develop a supportive social circle: Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who understand and support your values and aspirations. They can be your anchors during times of self-doubt and remind you of your worth. c. Enjoy your independence: Being single offers opportunities to explore hobbies, passions, and interests on your own terms. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, and develop a deeper relationship with yourself in the process. d. Embrace the journey: Yearning for a good relationship is natural, but remember not to view it as the ultimate end goal. Focus on your emotional well-being and personal fulfilment, irrespective of your relationship status. Trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. e. Seek professional help if necessary: If feelings of inadequacy persist, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor. They can offer guidance and support in dealing with any emotional obstacles you might be facing. 2. Do you think it's advisable to do a chartered A/C if you have nothing else to do (knowing you won't find it interesting at all)? It's essential to remember that career choices significantly impact your overall well-being and satisfaction in life. Choosing a profession solely because you have nothing else to do is not advisable, especially if you have no interest in it. Here are some things to keep in mind while weighing your options: a. Identify your interests and strengths: Reflect on the subjects and tasks that have truly captured your interest in the past and align them with your natural skills. This will help you find a field that you are truly passionate about. b. Research different industries and career paths: Explore various fields and professions, and try to find a career that suits both your interests and your values. Networking, mentorships, internships, or informational interviews can provide invaluable insights. c. Invest in education and skills development: Pursuing further education, vocational training, or professional certifications in your field of interest will help you gain the necessary knowledge and expertise for your desired profession. d. Be open to change and growth: Be prepared to adapt to new opportunities and challenges in your professional journey. Every experience contributes to your personal and professional development. In conclusion, it is crucial to value your personal and professional happiness, and you deserve to feel good about your achievements and your desires. As you navigate these decisions, always prioritize your well-being, personal growth, and long-term satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He devices many useful products using his knowledge of chemistry. Today, he has four solutions in front of him, solution A, solution B, solution C, and solution D. Solution A is a buffer, but solution B is not a buffer. Solution C is acidic, but solution D is not acidic. He needs to figure out what each solution does. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which solution would resist changes in pH, solution A or solution B? Hint: If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0. This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained.","completion":"Based on the given information, solution A would resist changes in pH. Step 1: Understand the properties of a buffer A buffer is a solution that has the ability to resist changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added. This property is crucial for maintaining the stability of various systems, including biological and chemical environments. Step 2: Determine which solution is a buffer The given paragraph states that solution A is a buffer, whereas solution B is not a buffer. Step 3: Answer the question Since solution A is a buffer, it possesses the ability to resist pH changes. Therefore, solution A would be the solution that resists changes in pH, and not solution B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Cut one strip per cookie.","completion":"After cutting the paper into thin, 4-inch strips, the next steps in making a fruit roll-up fortune cookie are as follows: 1. Write your fortunes: Using a pen, pencil, or fine-tipped marker, write personalized fortunes on each strip of paper. Consider adding humor, advice, or well-wishes to make each fortune unique and enjoyable for the recipient. 2. Prepare the fruit roll-ups: Unroll each fruit roll-up and carefully separate it from the backing. Depending on the size of your fruit roll-ups, you may need to cut or trim them into appropriately sized squares or circles, approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. 3. Position the fortunes: Place a paper fortune in the center of each fruit roll-up square or circle, ensuring that the fortune is horizontal and parallel to the edges of the fruit roll-up. 4. Fold the fruit roll-up: Carefully fold the fruit roll-up in half, enclosing the fortune inside. Press gently along the edge to seal the fruit roll-up, taking care not to tear the roll-up or the paper fortune inside. 5. Shape the fortune cookie: To create the classic fortune cookie shape, use your fingers to curve the folded edge of the fruit roll-up slightly upward while pressing the creased edge downward at the center. You can use a small, clean object (such as an egg carton or the rim of a measuring cup) to help hold the curved shape as the fruit roll-up sets. 6. Allow the fruit roll-up fortune cookies to set: It may be helpful to refrigerate the fortune cookies for a short period of time to help them maintain their shape. Place them on a plate or tray lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Keep fortune cookies in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes or until they are firm enough to hold their shape. 7. Serve and enjoy: Once the fruit roll-up fortune cookies have set, they are ready to be served. Arrange them on a plate or in a decorative box, perfect for sharing with friends and family. As each person unfolds their fruit roll-up fortune cookie, they will reveal the wise (or witty) words you've written on their paper fortune. 8. Store remaining fruit roll-up fortune cookies: If you have any leftover fortune cookies, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to keep them fresh. It is best to consume the fruit roll-up fortune cookies within a week for optimal freshness and flavor. Now you have successfully made fruit roll-up fortune cookies with personalized messages inside. Not only are they a creative twist on the traditional fortune cookie, but they also make a fun and flavorful dessert or party favor for any occasion. Enjoy the process of crafting each fortune and the reactions from those who receive them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: An anharmonic oscillator exploiting this effect as a microelectromechanical system component was proposed by Serry, Walliser, and Maclay. Julian Schwinger has postulated that sonoluminescence arises due to this effect, and this effect requires that bag radius and mass are independent under a combination of the Skyrmion and MIT models, the chiral bag model of the nucleon. One setup for measuring it attached a polystyrene sphere to an atomic force microscope, and Lamoreaux used a torsional pendulum to achieve the first precise measurements of this effect.

Question: This article: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\".

Age of the man: The original statement says \\"a man,\\" but it does not mention the age of the man. The age of the man is specified as \\"older\\" in the conclusion statement, which could not be derived from the given information. Therefore, it is unclear whether the man is older or younger, which adds ambiguity. 2. Counter vs. stand: The two statements use a different description for the place where the man is standing. The original statement says the man is standing next to a \\"stand,\\" whereas the conclusion talks about a \\"counter.\\" Even if both terms potentially refer to a surface or a piece of furniture (such as a display stand or a store counter), their meanings might not be interchangeable. 3. Lack of explicit information: Although there's a possibility that the given statement might refer to an older man standing next to a counter, this information is not explicitly mentioned.

When I sat down to watch 'Largo Winch' I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I stood up, I've seen both of these; and more. Karl Roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both acting superbly. In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well. The mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but I understand why people would get bored with it. The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning Croatian seaside both amazed me, and I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island. Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. It is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.

Donald Trump Tries to Hit the Reset Button on a Bad Week Donald Trump took to the lectern with his family in his opulent Trump National Golf Club Westchester as Queen‚Äôs anthem ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions‚Äù blared from the speakers. But the candidate was notably chastened. ‚ÄúI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI will make you proud of our party and our movement.‚Äù He spoke before a crowd of club members and a crush of television cameras on the night of the final GOP primary, subdued in the face of the harshest week of press coverage of his yearlong political career. With national Republicans feeling buyer‚Äôs remorse and threatening to abandon his nascent candidacy, Trump was under pressure to assuage the concerns of his party. The unconventional presumptive GOP nominee delivered a most conventional stump speech to prove he was up to the task of taking on newly crowned presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI will make you proud of our party and our movement.‚Äù Audience members seemed surprised by Trump‚Äôs subdued tone, attempting to interrupt him with call-and-response and cheers as is common at his rallies, but Trump largely brushed them off as he tried to maintain a sober image for the cameras. It is hardly Trump‚Äôs first pivot to attempting to appear more presidential, as the candidate and his team have been embroiled in a high-stakes debate over whether he needs to adjust his tone for the general election. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not changing,‚Äù he declared just days ago. But in the face of withering criticism it became clear to Trump that he needed to do just that ‚Äî at least for the evening. Highlighting the critical nature of the speech, Trump spoke with the aid of a pair of teleprompters, which were personally inspected by campaign chairman Paul Manafort before his remarks. Manafort has been the leading proponent within Trump‚Äôs campaign for the candidate to moderate his tone and to expand his appeal by appearing more presidential. (Trump has previously mocked other politicians for using teleprompters on the campaign trail and has called for them to be banned.) Trump made a direct appeal to supporters of vanquished Democrat Bernie Sanders, who he said failed in a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù system that benefited Clinton. ‚ÄúWe welcome you with open arms,‚Äù Trump said. Gone was the mocking tone Trump has adopted over the past year toward his rivals and their supporters. ‚ÄúTo everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you very much,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúTo those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support.‚Äù The roots of the current Trump crisis stemmed from an attack on U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is hearing the ongoing civil suit over the failed Trump University, called a scam by several attorneys general. Trump said the Indiana-born judge of Mexican heritage should be disqualified from hearing the suit because of the candidate‚Äôs plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after a weeks-long courtship, blasted Trump‚Äôs remark as ‚Äúthe textbook definition of a racist comment.‚Äù Illinois Senator Mark Kirk revoked his endorsement of Trump over the comment, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called on his colleagues to rethink their support of the party‚Äôs nominee, and Maine Senator Susan Collins left open the possibility of voting for Clinton. And while Trump‚Äôs comments may give some Republicans hope that the bombastic front runner can change his tune, many are worrying how long he can keep it up. Trump, who frequently boasts of himself as a ‚Äúcounter-puncher‚Äù instead absorbed the blows, issuing a statement that was as close as he has come to an apology this cycle. ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,‚Äù a statement from Trump read Tuesday. His remarks Tuesday evening included an attack on Clinton, but lacked the conservative red meat and conspiracy theories that have defined the last several weeks of his campaign. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created those problems,‚Äù Trump said, attacking the Clintons for alleged pay-for-access schemes. He also announced that he would deliver a ‚Äúmajor address‚Äù attacking Clinton on those themes on Monday. The political outsider then cast himself as the only agent of change in the race, in a theme designed to appeal across the political spectrum. ‚ÄúThis election isn‚Äôt about Republican or Democrat, it‚Äôs about who runs this country, the special interests or the people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created those problems.‚Äù Trump opened his remarks in Westchester saying, ‚ÄúTonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another.‚Äù His statement was an attempt to turn the page, but it remains to be seen how long he can keep reading from it.

Assessing the relevance: The review is about a book, and I need to first ensure that the product I am considering buying is indeed a book. If it's not, then the review is irrelevant, and I'll ignore it. 2. Understanding the review's content: The reviewer states that the book contains a lot of common sense information and lacks any groundbreaking secret to success. This suggests that the book might not provide significant new insights or guidance that I couldn't find elsewhere. 3. Evaluating the reviewer's perspective: The reviewer also mentions that if someone lacks people skills, the book could be beneficial to them. It seems like the book might have some usefulness for specific audiences. 4. Balancing positives and negatives: Although the book could have some value for certain individuals, the overall impression from the review is that the book may not be very helpful for someone who already possesses a certain level of common sense and people skills. Considering these points, the chances of me buying the product (assuming it is the book) would be slightly decreased because the review suggests that the book might not offer a great amount of new and unique insights or knowledge.

The weight of the cement-filled wheelbarrow had been somewhat challenging to maneuver, but Braden's determination and strength saw him through the task, his sweat-soaked brow a testament to his exertions. The sun shone down brightly overhead, casting sharp shadows around the backyard, as the encompassing trees swayed gently in the soft breeze like dancing emerald giants. As Braden set down the empty wheelbarrow, he took a moment to observe the now-filled hole in the ground. He could see the thick, gray cement gradually beginning to settle, slowly forming a solid and stable structure that would soon become the foundation for a magnificent addition to his backyard oasis. This new feature, a custom-built fire pit surrounded by elegant pavers, would be a place for reconnecting with family and friends, a sanctuary for sharing laughter, stories, and the warmth of shared experiences. Stepping back, Braden wiped the sweat from his forehead and reached for the cold drink he had left resting on a nearby table. The cool, refreshing liquid quenched his thirst, rejuvenating his spirit and fueling his determination to see this project through to completion. With the cement now in place, the next phase of construction could begin; laying the bricks that would comprise the fire pit's outer structure, carefully chosen for their attractiveness and resilience against the elements. Then, the paver stones surrounding the pit would complete the overall aesthetic, complementing the surrounding landscaping and creating the perfect focal point for his backyard haven. As the cement dries, Braden anticipates the challenges that lie ahead, aware of the dedication and attention to detail required to bring his vision to fruition. He mentally prepares himself for the precise planning and execution involved in both bricklaying and paver installation, knowing that his backyard retreat hinges on his ability to transform raw materials into a harmonious, unified space, that will offer years of enjoyment for himself and his loved ones. The satisfaction he will feel when the final stone is placed cannot be understated. He can already envision the gleaming firelight, the soft crackle of wood as it burns, and the soothing ambiance only a backyard fire pit can provide. With renewed energy, Braden takes a deep breath, focusing on the task at hand and committing himself to laying brick after brick, stone after stone, until his masterwork is complete. And as the day unfolds, punctuated by the rhythm of his hammer, the scrape of his trowel, and the gentle laying of each integral piece, the vision of his backyard sanctuary grows steadily closer to reality and stands as a testament to the power of human ingenuity, tireless effort, and the enduring desire to create places of comfort, joy, and connection, nestled within the heart of one's very own home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is Italy's national flower","completion":"Italy's national flower is the Lily, specifically the Strelitzia Reginae, also known as the \\"Flower of the Lily\\" or \\"Giglio.\\" The Lily holds great historical, cultural, and symbolic significance throughout Italy and has been cherished for centuries. The beautiful Giglio can be found in art, architecture, and Italian culture, both traditional and modern. The Lily is a perennial, bulbous plant that belongs to the Liliaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America and is widely cultivated in different parts of the world for its vibrant colors and elegant appearance. The Strelitzia Reginae is a unique and striking species of the Lily that features bold and bright colors like yellow and orange combined with a royal blue. The flowers have a distinct, elongated shape, with six tepals (a combination of petals and sepals) and six stamens. The symbolic meaning of the Lily in Italy traces back to the ancient Roman Empire. Some Roman emperors were known to have used the Lily as a symbol of power and authority. The Lily has also been associated with the Roman goddess Juno, who was the queen of the gods and wife of Jupiter. During the Middle Ages, the Lily became a symbol of the Virgin Mary in Italy, representing purity, innocence, and compassion. Italian artworks and frescoes from this period often depict the Lily alongside the Madonna and Child. In the Renaissance period, the Lily continued to hold symbolic importance in Italy. The city of Florence, which was a major cultural and artistic hub during the Renaissance, adopted the Lily as its emblem and symbol of civic pride. The emblem, known as the \\"Giglio Fiorentino,\\" is a stylized version of the Strelitzia Reginae, and is often seen in Florentine architecture, art, and fashion. In modern times, the Lily remains a beloved symbol in Italian culture. The Giglio Fiorentino is still prominently featured in the official emblem of the city of Florence, and Lilies can be found in gardens, floral arrangements, and as decorative elements throughout Italy. The Lily is also used to represent Italian sports teams, such as ACF Fiorentina, a professional football club based in Florence. It is not just a symbol of beauty in Italy, but also of a rich historical and cultural heritage. The Lily has become an enduring emblem of Italy's national identity, representing the nation's passion for art and its fascinating history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and... - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Off Label, Off Base? Every day in medical offices around the country, physicians hand patients prescriptions for drugs to treat conditions for which the medicines haven't been approved. Once a drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a doctor can, with rare exceptions, legally prescribe it \\"off label\\": for use as he or she sees fit. That's a primary reason people with depression or attention-deficit disorder are prescribed drugs approved to treat seizures, acne patients are given prescriptions for antibiotics, and insomniacs are advised to take a schizophrenia drug. And it's why tens of millions of post-menopausal women for years were told to take estrogen, a drug approved to treat osteoporosis, as a way of staving off heart disease, improving their mood and memory, and smoothing wrinkles. Off-label use of drugs may be axiomatic in medicine, but a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine finds that the practice is frequently grounded more in anecdote than in hard science. Using data from a national survey of 3,500 office-based physicians, researchers found that 21 percent of the 725 million prescriptions written in 2001 were for off-label uses. Seventy-three percent of these prescriptions lacked strong scientific justification, such as a clinical trial, and were based on observational studies, case reports or no discernable evidence. And without solid evidence of safety and effectiveness, the researchers maintain, consumers run the risk of taking ineffective, expensive and potentially dangerous drugs. Estrogen is one such example. Only after doctors had prescribed it for decades to prevent a panoply of problems did a large clinical trial in 2002 find that the hormone actually increased the risk of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, incontinence and dementia. The new study, funded by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, compared patients' diagnoses with labeling information from the 100 most commonly prescribed drugs, as well as 60 randomly selected medications. Researchers then assessed the amount of scientific support for each case of off-label use. Some prescriptions were logical extensions of the approved labeling, such as giving an asthma drug to treat another lung ailment. Others were less clear, such as using a seizure drug to quell anxiety. \\"There is enormous variation in the reason drugs are used off-label, from extremely good evidence to experimentation,\\" said Randall Stafford, one of the study's co-authors. Stafford, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said he was surprised by how many prescriptions were written without solid scientific justification. In psychiatry, for example, researchers found that 96 percent of off-label prescriptions lacked strong scientific support. David Schopick, who practices in Portsmouth, N.H., said he thinks some of his fellow child psychiatrists \\"draw the line where we think our colleagues draw the line\\" between innovation, which is ethical, and experimentation, which is not. Enthusiasm for off-label prescribing has waned somewhat in psychiatry, he added, because of reports that antidepressants may trigger suicidal behavior in teenagers. \\"So much of what we prescribe has not been shown to be effective\\" in children, but has been approved for adults, he added. In addition to psychiatric medications, drugs to treat heart disease, asthma, allergies and seizures are commonly prescribed for unapproved uses, the study found. Drugs used to lower cholesterol and control diabetes were least likely to be prescribed for other conditions, researchers found. Reasons for the burgeoning practice vary, Stafford and other experts say. Some doctors may be swayed by small, promising studies funded by manufacturers tempted to increase a drug's sales without going through the expensive, time-consuming process of expanding its approved uses. (FDA regulations prohibit companies from marketing a drug to treat a condition for which it hasn't been specifically approved.) In other cases, influential practitioners known as \\"thought leaders\\" in their specialty may endorse the use of a drug, their views then spread by word of mouth, especially at conferences. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Off-label drug use means doctors prescribe medicines for treating conditions that the medications haven't been officially approved for. Although this practice is legal, many times it is based more on personal experiences and anecdotes rather than strong scientific evidence, which can lead to patients taking potentially ineffective, costly, and risky drugs."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Which event happened two years after the Russo-Japanese War ended?\\" Context: \\"When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854‚Äì56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica, was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente.

Abby Wambach, the skillful forward for the U.S. women's soccer team, scored dramatic headers against Brazil and France to help the American team advance to the World Cup final. Now she's heading off to the championship match against a tough Japan team, a much-awaited contest set for Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany -- where the U.S. can win the tournament for a record third time. The 31-year-old Wambach, speaking to CNN in a phone interview on Thursday, bubbled with confidence, patriotism, and enthusiasm as the team bids to follow up its 1991 and 1999 successes. She thinks the United States can beat Japan, a team emboldened to score a victory for a nation wracked with tragedy this year after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the country. Who will star at the women's World Cup? Japan, she said, is a \\"possession-oriented\\" squad that's \\"technical on the ball.\\" \\"We have to be patient. We're going to get chances and have moments where we can score goals, and I think physically we're going to be able to dominate them,\\" she said. \\"So, if we can take care of the chances that we get, put away goals early on.\\" Wambach, according to her bio on the U.S. team website, has \\"developed into one of the most dangerous goal scorers in the world\\" and is \\"one of the world's best players in the air\\" -- as proven by her heading skills. The U.S. advanced to the final after defeating France 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. Wambach scored the second in the 79th minute with a dramatic header, her third goal of the tournament so far. And her last-gasp headed goal against Brazil on Sunday -- which got her an ESPN ESPY award for \\"best play\\" -- helped the U.S. level at 2-2 and take the quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, in which she also scored. Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? \\"Some say maybe it was perfect timing for us,\\" she said, noting she was humbled and honored by the ESPY award. \\"We believe it's our destiny.\\" People are gathering in sports bars to cheer on the U.S. team, and the American support for the World Cup team has thrilled the players. \\"Pretty amazing,\\" said Wambach. \\"We really want to make everybody back home proud. We're going to keep this thing going. We have this huge game on Sunday and if we can all play well and keep giving our most and leave everything on the field, hopefully we'll come home as World Cup champs.\\" Wambach was asked whether she will have another shot at a World Cup, which is played every four years. \\"It's a good question but right now my focus is here (in Germany),\\" she said. \\"This team is special. And this team, I can't put my finger on what makes this team so special, but the fact is we just don't give up. We're not quitters. We won't give up for the entire 90 minutes that we play on Sunday. \\"I think we can do this.

In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world. Question: \\"Who should be generous and caring to their neighbours\\" Response: \\"Living beings\\" Choices: a). no. b). yes. Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"b). yes. The response \\"Living beings\\" correctly answers the question because it implies that everyone, including humans, should be generous and caring to their neighbors. The other option, a). no, is incorrect because it contradicts the idea of being kind and caring to others. Being kind and caring to our neighbors is important for a peaceful and harmonious community, as it helps build strong relationships and understanding among people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Which immigrants was against in the riot of 19th century, Russia or Irish?, Context: These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic Nativist riots had erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city. Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559.

Sally was a lovely lady who lived with her family and friends. One day, Sally went missing, and everyone was very worried about her. They didn't know where she could be, and they really wanted to find her so that she could be safe at home again. The people who help find missing people, like the police and lots of helpers from the town, started searching everywhere. They looked in parks, streets, and even in the woods to try and find Sally. They also asked people in the town if they had seen her or knew where she could be. Everyone was trying really hard to find her, because they all cared about her. One day, while they were searching near the water in South Tyneside, they found a body. A body is what we call a person when they're not alive anymore, like when someone passes away. They were very sad to find out that the body was Sally Allan. When they confirmed that the body was Sally, they told her family and friends, who were very heartbroken. They were very sad, but they knew that at least they had found her, and they could say goodbye to her. Sally's family and friends held a special ceremony to remember her and celebrate her life. They talked about what a wonderful person she was and how much they all loved her. They also thanked everyone who had helped look for her, because it was very important for them to know that she was found. The police and helpers from the town continued to work together to make sure that other people who go missing can be found and brought back to their families.

Summarize this article: An experimental drug derived from peanuts protected some children and adolescents with life-threatening peanut allergies, according to a study, allowing the subjects to eat small amounts of peanuts without suffering a serious reaction. The drug, from a small California company, Aimmune Therapeutics, didn‚Äôt work for everyone, has some side effects and hasn‚Äôt been approved by regulators for sale. Yet the findings from the late-stage trial promise a potential new solution for peanut allergies, a growing concern. ... ||||| Abstract Background Peanut allergy, for which there are no approved treatment options, affects patients who are at risk for unpredictable and occasionally life-threatening allergic reactions. Methods In a phase 3 trial, we screened participants 4 to 55 years of age with peanut allergy for allergic dose-limiting symptoms at a challenge dose of 100 mg or less of peanut protein (approximately one third of a peanut kernel) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Participants with an allergic response were randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive AR101 (a peanut-derived investigational biologic oral immunotherapy drug) or placebo in an escalating-dose program. Participants who completed the regimen (i.e., received 300 mg per day of the maintenance regimen for approximately 24 weeks) underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at trial exit. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants 4 to 17 years of age who could ingest a challenge dose of 600 mg or more, without dose-limiting symptoms. Results Of the 551 participants who received AR101 or placebo, 496 were 4 to 17 years of age; of these, 250 of 372 participants (67.2%) who received active treatment, as compared with 5 of 124 participants (4.0%) who received placebo, were able to ingest a dose of 600 mg or more of peanut protein, without dose-limiting symptoms, at the exit food challenge (difference, 63.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 53.0 to 73.3; P<0.001). During the exit food challenge, the maximum severity of symptoms was moderate in 25% of the participants in the active-drug group and 59% of those in the placebo group and severe in 5% and 11%, respectively. Adverse events during the intervention period affected more than 95% of the participants 4 to 17 years of age. A total of 34.7% of the participants in the active-drug group had mild events, as compared with 50.0% of those in the placebo group; 59.7% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively, had events that were graded as moderate, and 4.3% and 0.8%, respectively, had events that were graded as severe. Efficacy was not shown in the participants 18 years of age or older. Conclusions In this phase 3 trial of oral immunotherapy in children and adolescents who were highly allergic to peanut, treatment with AR101 resulted in higher doses of peanut protein that could be ingested without dose-limiting symptoms and in lower symptom severity during peanut exposure at the exit food challenge than placebo. (Funded by Aimmune Therapeutics; PALISADE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02635776.) ||||| Experts who were not involved in the trial said the outcomes exceeded their expectations, calling the results ‚Äúpotentially lifesaving.‚Äù But they also cautioned that the treatment does not cure peanut allergies and should not be attempted at home. They emphasized that children who complete the regimen need to continue to eat a peanut-free diet and may need to keep up maintenance therapy with minute doses of peanut, possibly for the rest of their lives. ‚ÄúThis is not the cure, but it is a good first step,‚Äù said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., chief medical officer of Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a nonprofit advocacy group that focuses on food allergies, noting the results were better than he expected. Until now, he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had nothing, nothing to give these poor kids that can keep them from having these reactions and put them in a much more positive outlook on life. It‚Äôs just a wonderful thing to have. ‚ÄúThe fact that the kids were eating the equivalent of a peanut a day pretty much tells you that if they accidentally eat a peanut, they won‚Äôt have a life-threatening reaction,‚Äù Dr. Baker said. Michael Perkin, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatric allergy consultant at St. George‚Äôs, University of London who wrote an accompanying editorial about the study, said the regimen was ‚Äúnot a walk in the park‚Äù and requires tremendous discipline. Children are required to rest for two hours after receiving their daily dose but cannot fall asleep because of the risk of a reaction. Dr. Perkin said that the long-term side effects of consuming allergens when one has a severe allergy are still unknown. But he described the results as ‚Äúbeyond exciting.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a cure like an antibiotic that makes a bug go away and it‚Äôs not there anymore,‚Äù he said. But ‚Äúpsychologically it makes a massive difference if you can keep your kid from living in fear. These kids can eat enough peanut that parents no longer will have to worry about their teenage daughter kissing someone who‚Äôs eaten peanut butter. You cannot estimate what a psychological relief that is.‚Äù For children like Carter Grodi, a junior in high school in Ocala, Fla., who completed the treatment a year ago and continues to ingest a small amount of peanut every day to maintain his low-level tolerance, the treatment was transformative, making it easier to go out with friends and make plans to go away for college. ||||| Summary:","completion":"An experimental peanut-derived drug named AR101 has shown promise in treating some children and adolescents with life-threatening peanut allergies, according to a study by Aimmune Therapeutics.

He was one of the most important English theologians of the sixteenth century. His defence of the role of redeemed reason informed the theology of the seventeenth century Caroline divines and later provided many members of the Church of England with a theological method which combined the claims of revelation, reason and tradition. Scholars disagree regarding Hooker's relationship with what would later be called \\"Anglicanism\\" and the Reformed theological tradition. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the originator of the Anglican \\"via media\\" between Protestantism and Catholicism. However, a growing number of scholars have argued that he should be considered as being in the mainstream Reformed theology of his time and that he only sought to oppose the extremists, (Puritans) rather than moving the Church of England away from Protestantism. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains.

Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - Heavitree is a district of the city of Exeter in Devon, England.

In music, a single, record single or music single is a type of release, typically a song recording of fewer tracks than an LP record, an album or an EP record. This can be released for sale to the public in a variety of different formats. In most cases, a single is a song that is released separately from an album, although it usually also appears on an album.

There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger, who seeks relief from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) are also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), is becoming dependent on a potent narcotic. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys, led by \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocious (Powers Boothe). The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist. Wyatt, though no longer a lawman, is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys as tensions rise. Curly Bill begins shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house and is approached by Marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.) to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) and other Cowboys are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Clanton and Frank Stilwell close... A:","completion":"The names of Wyatt Earp's brothers are Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp. They are portrayed by Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton, respectively, in the movie Tombstone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: to show confidence. By practicing the physical act of appearing confident, you will actually start to feel more confident. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold your chin up, relax your shoulders, and breathe deeply. This will naturally make you seem more attractive to anyone who's around you. The more you practice good posture, the more natural it will feel. Speaking slowly gives other people the impression that you're confident and knowledgeable. You will also seem more authoritative if you slightly lower your vocal range as you speak. When you're telling a story, think about each sentence and how it relates to what you're saying. Don't be afraid to leave a pause between sentences while you're speaking. It seems more confident than using filler words like \\"um\\" or \\"like.\\" People who are more physically engaged while they're speaking seem more confident than those who do not. Gesture with your hands to emphasize strong points. Think about how to use your body to convey a message. For instance, you could lean forward and rest your hand on your chin when you're interested in what someone else is saying. No matter what you look like, you'll be the most attractive when you're happy with how you look. Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. If you wear makeup, play up the features that you like the most. Alpha males are attracted to confidence, and wearing too much makeup can make you seem insecure. Keep your makeup natural-looking on most of your face. If you do go bold, emphasize one feature of your face at a time. For instance, if you wear a bold red lip, opt for a subtle smoky eye and subtle eyeliner. If you go for a dramatic winged liner and dark eyeshadow, try pairing it with a nude lip and a little blush. Smelling good can make you seem more attractive. A little goes a long way, though. Spritz a little of the fragrance on your wrists, then touch your wrists to your neck to transfer the scent.","completion":"This article talks about how to appear more confident and attractive.

It also does not belong to Slavic languages, including Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian. After some investigation, it appears that \\"–ö–∞—Ä–∫–∞–±—É—ç–π\\" does not correspond to any known word in widely used languages. It could potentially be a word or a name in a less studied language or local dialect, although without further context it's difficult to ascertain. There are various languages in the world with distinct scripts and spelling conventions, and it's sometimes challenging to identify a particular language with a single isolated word. This situation underscores the importance of context in language identification. Contextual clues can provide more information that makes it easier to identify the language of a specific word or phrase. In scenarios where a single word or phrase's language is unknown and context is not provided, linguistic analysis can focus on factors like the word's script, orthography, phonology, and morphosyntactic structure. In the case of \\"–ö–∞—Ä–∫–∞–±—É—ç–π,\\" the word's script suggests that it might belong to one of the languages that use the Cyrillic script, which includes Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, and several others.

How to breed livebearing tropical fish Select the species you would like to breed. Several varieties of livebearers are available from most pet stores, including guppies, platies, mollies, swordtails, and endlers. All of these have similar needs. OPT: [i] Figure out your fish's specific needs before breeding them so that you can breed them together. Some types of livebearers-birds, shrimp, turtles, amphibians-live in tropical environments. [ii] Choose several livebearers based on your needs, regardless of what type of fish you choose. To choose multiple livebearers, inspect the specific species you would like to breed to figure out the potential cost. [iii] Choosing the species that best meets your needs will help you make the best use of your time. Tropical livebearers are approximately 7.8 feet (2.7 m) in length. [iv] Whichever variety you select, ask for a 50/50 mix of males and females. Livebearers will do well in a standard 20-30 gallon tank setup. Answer:","completion":"[i] Figure out your fish's specific needs before breeding them so that you can breed them together. Some types of livebearers, such as birds, shrimp, turtles, and amphibians, live in tropical environments. Each species has a unique set of requirements, making it essential to understand these before attempting breeding. In the case of livebearing tropical fish, there are various factors that you need to consider to ensure a successful reproduction process. Firstly, it's important to provide the proper tank conditions. Since these fish come from tropical environments, they require stable water temperatures in the range of 72-80¬∞F (22-27¬∞C). This can be easily maintained using a reliable heater and a thermometer to monitor the temperature. Apart from this, ensuring a consistent pH level between 7.0 and 8.0 is vital for their health and breeding success. To achieve this, regular water testing must be carried out, and suitable buffering agents or water additives can be used, if necessary. Moreover, livebearers generally prefer densely-planted tanks, which provide them with a sense of security, opportunities to establish territories, and ideal spots for nurturing their fry. To create this environment, you can add a variety of plants, including Java moss, Hornwort, or Water Sprite that provide good hiding spots for the young ones. Additionally, a good quality air pump and filter system are crucial to maintaining appropriate oxygen levels and keeping the water clean. Another crucial aspect is providing a balanced and nutritious diet to the fish you want to breed. You can feed them a mix of high-quality flake food, pellets, and live or frozen foods. A diversified diet rich in vitamins and minerals will increase their overall health and reproductive success. Furthermore, when selecting the fish for breeding, you need to look for healthy and vibrant specimens. A good ratio to maintain is one male to two or three females, as it prevents excessive competition or harassment among the male fish. It's essential to understand the specific breeding behavior and compatibility of the fish species you choose. For instance, guppies can be bred with endlers, mollies with sailfin mollies, and platies with swordtails. However, it's crucial to avoid breeding closely-related fish, as this could result in genetic issues and unhealthy offspring. Lastly, to monitor the progress of breeding effectively, it may be useful to set up a separate breeding tank or employ a breeding box within the main tank. This dedicated space isolates the pregnant females and reduces stress, granting them a secure place to give birth. It protects the fry from being eaten by other tank-mates and helps ensure their survival until they can be introduced to the community. In conclusion, the key to successfully breeding livebearing tropical fish is to thoroughly understand the specific needs and requirements of the chosen species, provide them with a well-maintained habitat, and ensure optimum conditions for their reproduction and fry's development. Planning and dedication will lead to a higher chance of success in breeding and raising healthy, vibrant tropical fish in your aquarium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: How to sponge paint a bathroom<br>Apply painter's tape to the ceiling where it meets the wall, the doorjambs, wood trim and any areas where the walls of the bathroom meet the tile. This will protect these areas from the paint and help make cleanup easier. Pour some of the paint in the base color, or color that will be behind the sponged paint, into a paint tray. Hypothesis: Painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier from the given context. The context provides a detailed explanation of using painter's tape while sponge painting a bathroom and highlights its utility in the process. Painter's tape, a versatile and indispensable tool for any painting project, is designed to protect specific areas from paint, create paint-free zones, and ensure sharp and clean lines in the finished paint job. In the context provided, the tape is applied to important areas where the bathroom walls meet the ceiling, doorjambs, wood trim, and tile. These areas are typically adjacent to the sections being painted, but not intended to be painted themselves. By protecting these areas with painter's tape, you can achieve a result with neater edges and a more professional appearance. Additionally, it ensures that paint does not accidentally spill or spread onto unintended surfaces, so you avoid mistakes and preserve the original appearance of those sections. Using painter's tape not only streamlines the final result, but it also helps simplify the cleaning process after the painting is completed. If paint were to make contact with unwanted surfaces, attempting to remove it afterward would be time-consuming and laborious, taking away from the overall efficiency of the project. By preventing paint from reaching these areas in the first place, painter's tape greatly reduces the amount of time and effort necessary for cleanup. In conclusion, the hypothesis that painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier can be drawn from the provided context. The use of painter's tape in sponge painting a bathroom serves several purposes, such as protecting surfaces, ensuring precise lines, and, indeed, simplifying the cleanup process after the painting is finished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars).

Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item‚Äîlike a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie‚Äîand started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\".

Build a movie plot around this: Who's death is Tasmin reminded of when Mona tries on the red dress? her sister Sadie The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: The Red Dress Step 1: Introduce Characters and Setting The story is set in a small, close-knit town. Our main characters are Tasmin, a thoughtful and introverted young woman who is still mourning the loss of her sister Sadie, and Mona, Tasmin's spontaneous and bubbly best friend. They grew up together, and Mona has been a support system for Tasmin since her sister's death. Step 2: Establish the Sisters' Relationship Tasmin and Sadie were inseparable, and Sadie had always been the more outgoing and adventurous sibling, often leading Tasmin to experience things she otherwise wouldn't. Sadie's death in a tragic accident has deeply impacted Tasmin, causing her to become more reclusive and immersed in her own thoughts. Step 3: Introduce the Red Dress During an attempt to lift Tasmin's spirits, Mona convinces her to go on a shopping trip with her. Mona, seeing a stunning red dress at a boutique, insists that Tasmin should try it on. However, upon seeing Mona wear the red dress, Tasmin is suddenly reminded of an impactful memory with her sister. Unbeknownst to Mona, Sadie owned a similar dress which she wore to a memorable occasion that Tasmin cherishes. Step 4: Develop the Mystery Tasmin is hesitant to share her feelings about the red dress with Mona. She becomes intrigued and consumed by the memory her sister wearing the similar dress on that special night, and embarks on a journey to uncover the deeper meaning behind the connection and Sadie's untold story. Step 5: Mona's Involvement As Tasmin delves into her sister's past and her thoughts about the red dress, Mona realizes how important this journey is for her best friend. Despite initially being hurt by Tasmin's reluctance to share her feelings, Mona remains a supportive companion and helps Tasmin unravel the mystery. Step 6: Emotional Growth and Unraveling the Mystery The journey leads Tasmin and Mona to revisit places from Sadie's life, uncovering secrets about her sister's aspirations, relationships, and passions that Tasmin was unaware of. Through this process, Tasmin develops a deeper understanding of her sister's life and helps her find closure and peace. Step 7: Conclusion In the end, it is revealed that the red dress is not only a symbol of Sadie's love for life, but also a reminder of the unbreakable bond between the two sisters. The journey allows Tasmin to honor her sister's memory, and she finally accepts that Sadie's spirit will always be with her. Additionally, this experience brings Mona and Tasmin closer, strengthening their friendship and showing how important it is to support one another during difficult times. The answer to the question is: When Mona tries on the red dress, Tasmin is reminded of her sister Sadie's death, as Sadie had worn a similar red dress to a memorable occasion.

Q: Context: Metformin may benefit the macrovascular complications of diabetes independently of its conventional hypoglycemic effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes participate in type 2 diabetes and its atherothrombotic manifestations. Therefore, this study examined the potential action of metformin as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory responses in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages (Mphis), and endothelial cells (ECs).', 'Metformin dose-dependently inhibited IL-1beta-induced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in ECs, SMCs, and Mphis. Investigation of potential signaling pathways demonstrated that metformin diminished IL-1beta-induced activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in SMCs. Furthermore, metformin suppressed IL-1beta-induced activation of the pro-inflammatory phosphokinases Akt, p38, and Erk, but did not affect PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity. To address the significance of the anti-inflammatory effects of a therapeutically relevant plasma concentration of metformin (20 micromol/L), we conducted experiments in ECs treated with high glucose. Pretreatment with metformin also decreased phosphorylation of Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) in ECs under these conditions. Answer: These data suggest that metformin can exert a direct vascular anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-kappaB through blockade of the PI3K-Akt pathway. The novel anti-inflammatory actions of metformin may explain in part the apparent clinical reduction by metformin of cardiovascular events not fully attributable to its hypoglycemic action.

This businesswoman became, for a time, the world's richest self-made woman. Her secret? \\"I didn't get there by dreaming about it,\\" she would say. \\"I got there by doing it.\\" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products. So Estee \\"by accident\\" dropped a bottle of youth dew on the floor in the cosmetics department. As the _ spread around the store, customers came over and asked to buy it. The store soon began selling Estee's products. Estee led her company until 1982, when her son Leonard took over the business. Until her health worsened in the mid-1990s, she continued to attend the opening of a new store wherever in the world. She died on April 24, 2004.

Sentence:","completion":"Albert Jennings Fountain, born in New York's Staten Island, met his demise in the New Mexico Territory, United States, on February 1, 1896. To delve deeper into the details provided, Albert Jennings Fountain was a prominent individual in American history. He was born on Staten Island, New York, which is the southernmost of New York City's five boroughs. Over the course of his life, Fountain lived through a variety of major events that defined the landscape of the United States. His birthplace hints at a northeast upbringing, close to the bustle of metropolitan life in one of the most significant cities in the United States, and by extension, the world. This kind of urban upbringing could have exposed Fountain to a variety of cultural influences, from the European immigrants pouring into the city to the evolving landscape of American politics, literature, and art. However, despite the urban roots, Fountain met his death in a starkly different locale: the New Mexico Territory in the United States. The New Mexico Territory, an organized area of the United States that existed from 1850 to 1912, would have presented a stark contrast to Life in New York. It was characterized by shifting cultural dynamics between Native American and European settlers, the distinct flavors of southwestern culture, and the untamed wilderness of the American desert landscape. Tragically, Fountain's life journey ended on February 1, 1896. The specific circumstances of his death were not provided within the data, but the harsh and often lawless nature of life in US territories during the late 1800s could suggest a variety of possible scenarios, from conflict to illness.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: What is the researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output? Answer: A:","completion":"The researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output is based on the adverse effects it can have on the birds' health and well-being. According to the British-based researchers, including David Dominoni from Glasgow University, the birds, specifically robins, are singing more due to exposure to artificial light from street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes. This light pollution affects their biological clock and makes them active during both day and night. The increased song output requires more energy, leading to potential negative consequences for the birds. Singing is a costly behavior that demands energy, and by increasing their song output, the birds might face energy-related costs, such as exhaustion or reduced time for other crucial activities like resting, foraging, or mating. Additionally, the disrupted biological clock from light exposure can lead to gene expression alterations, causing genes to be active at incorrect times of the day. Furthermore, it is not just robins that are being affected by artificial light; other bird species, such as blackbirds and seagulls, are also experiencing increased nocturnal behaviors due to the same issue. As a result, researchers are concerned that these unnatural changes in birds' behaviors may lead to potential risks in their overall health and survival."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyze the differences in meaning. - Both sentences discuss a claim that the church was founded in the 7th century by St. Birinus, so their core content is the same. - \\"It has been\\" has a present perfect construction, which might suggest that the claim is valid or relevant to the present, whereas \\"It was\\" uses a simple past construction, which might suggest a more detached, historical view of the claim. 3. Consider if the differences affect overall meaning significantly. - In normal conversation or writing, it's unlikely the choice of present perfect or simple past tense would have a significant impact on the reader's understanding of the claim. - The presence or absence of a period after \\"St\\" in \\"St. Birinus\\" also doesn't affect the meaning as both refer to the same person. 4.

The Navy SEAL turned author who was there as Osama bin Laden was killed and promised to 'set the record straight' about the mission that led to his demise has been identified as a soldier who has since retired from service. The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC. But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission. Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name. But that didn‚Äôt stop the Associated Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers. The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops soldier‚Äôs identity can be worrisome. He said: ‚ÄòWe protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it‚Äôs a concern.' Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday. In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets. Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and former troops from spilling military matters and national security issues. Other departments, including the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White House, were also caught off-guard. That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book. Lt Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House. But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day. 'We. don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a. determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said. But the publisher maintains that. Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special. operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag. Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down. No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin. Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last. year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan. Maurer. spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and. Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer. The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL. The blog added that the book will. culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the. terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com. says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a SEAL Team. Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates. in 2009. Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama. Owen's book comes on the heels of. another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed. three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary. Clinton. That explosive allegation is. contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the. White House‚Äôs carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader. who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a. myth. Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday. A. film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker. director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19. Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information. The Obama administration denied the claims. Mission: Bin Laden was killed during the 40-minute operation by the elite Navy SEAL Team Six in his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, seen here. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article tells us about a book named 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama bin Laden'. The author of this book used the name Mark Owen to keep his real identity a secret, but we later find out his real name is Matt Bissonnette, and he was a Navy SEAL. He was part of the team that went on a mission to find Osama bin Laden, a very bad man, in Pakistan in May 2011. Matt wrote this book to tell the world what really happened during that mission. The book was supposed to come out on September 11, which is a very sad day when bad people attacked New York and Washington, DC. But Matt's real name got out before the book was published, and this worried some people at the Pentagon, which is like the head office for the military, because they didn't want people to know who he really was for safety reasons. Some other important people, like those who work in the CIA and the White House, didn't know the book was coming out either. If the book has any secret information, it could get Matt in trouble. But the people who are publishing the book say it doesn't include anything that it shouldn't. The book also tells us about how Matt became a Navy SEAL and about some of his other missions. Another important thing to know is that there's a movie coming out about the same mission which is called Zero Dark Thirty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A video investigated in the disappearance of Antigo teen Kayla Berg in 2009 is fake and does not relate to an abduction or illegal activity, Police Chief Erick Roller said Wednesday. Investigators found the producer of the one-minute clip and the two actors, including a women or girl depicted as tied up, kept in a dark room and screaming for help, Roller said. \\"We determined that they produced the video as a series of videos and posted this one in October 2009,\\" he said in a statement. \\"They did not intend to depict any reference to our missing Kayla Berg.\\" In an interview Wednesday, Roller said the video was made on the East Coast by the two actors - both adults - but he wouldn't specify where. Investigators spoke to both people and it was unclear why they made the video, but the pair said they had no idea it was being associated with Kayla Berg, the police chief said. The actors said the video was made seven years ago and they forgot about it, Roller said. Berg's mother and others familiar with Berg had indicted the girl in the video could be her. She vanished in August 2009. The video, discovered on YouTube and entitled \\"Hi Walter! I got a new gf!,\\" a reference to a girlfriend, was removed from the site Tuesday. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FBI is stepping in to investigate a bizarre YouTube video that some believe may be missing Antigo teen Kayla Berg. The video titled, \\"Hi Walter! I got a new gf!\\" was posted back in October of 2009, just a couple months after her disappearance. In it, a man describes an encounter with his new girlfriend, and then shows a woman who appears to be held captive in a locked room. That video has since been removed from the site. Kayla's mom Hope Sprenger was concerned that the girl in the video could be her missing daughter. \\"[It] sounded like her, looked like her, it gave me chills,\\" Sprenger said. \\"Disturbing. \\"It made me sick to my stomach.\\" Sprenger said certain details in the video had her concerned. \\"The clothing could be a big possibility,\\" she said. \\"We do believe she was wearing that type of shirt, we know she had jeans.\\" Kronenwetter Police Chief Daniel Joling said Tuesday the man in the video is not a resident of Kronenwetter and \\"I can attest to the fact unequivocally that the video was not taken in the residence here in the village.\\" For Sprenger, the video is a reminder of the nightmare that began seven years ago. \\"I thought it looked a lot like her,\\" she said. \\"I pray to God it's not.\\" Antigo Police also say the girl at the end of the video does resemble Berg. They've received numerous tips since the video surfaced, and are actively investigating its origin as well. \\"We'll do whatever we can to find out who's in there and identify them,\\" Police Chief Eric Roller said. \\"Sometimes that's hard on the web because of wherever this stuff may originate from [but] we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of it. A man who lives in Marathon County, who appeared to look like the man in the video, has been contacted by authorities, but cleared of having anything to do with the disturbing video. ||||| Police in Wisconsin now say a disturbing YouTube video investigated in the 2009 disappearance of a teenage girl is fake. Investigators \\"identified the video producer/camera man, actor and actress in the video,\\" the Antigo police said in a statement, adding that that the department, \\"has been able to identify that this video is 100 percent fake.\\" The video has no connection to the disappearance of Kayla Berg, the statement added. In the nearly minute-long video -- called \\"Hi Walter! I got a new gf today!\\" -- a man talks into the camera, saying he met a girl at the mall and then took her back to his place. The video then shows a woman screaming on the floor in a dark bathroom. She appears to be bound. The video was posted on Oct. 11, 2009, \\"but has recently gone viral, and many believed it was connected to our missing person Kayla Berg,\\" said the police in Antigo, a town of 8,000 people about 200 miles north of Milwaukee. Berg, who would now be 23 years old, vanished on Aug. 11, 2009, in Antigo, and her disappearance remains a mystery. Her mother, Hope Sprenger, told ABC affiliate WAOW in Wisconsin that the young woman in the video sounded and looked like Berg. \\"I thought it looked a lot like her,\\" Sprenger said. \\"I pray to God it's not.\\" \\"The clothing could be a big possibility,\\" she added. \\"We do believe she was wearing that type of shirt. We know she had jeans.\\" \\"It made me sick to my stomach,\\" Sprenger said. The FBI had been assisting the Antigo Police with Kayla's case since 2009 and also said it looked into the video. Eric Roller, the chief of police in Antigo, said he was notified this weekend after somebody found the disturbing video online and then researched missing females from that time. Berg \\"came up\\" in the search, and that individual shared the video with police, he said. According to Roller, in the seven years Berg has been missing, the police have followed every tip they have received about her disappearance. \\"Every tip that we do get on Kayla we take seriously,\\" Roller said. \\"One day we're going to have that one tip that's going to make that difference, and we are gonna find something.\\" ABC News' Courtney Condron and Mike Levine contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"A video that some people thought might relate to the disappearance of a teenage girl named Kayla Berg in 2009 is actually fake.

While some people propose that certain images are universal, most psychiatrists feel your personal connection with a color is more important than what that color symbolizes on a winder scale. When you think of red, what do you think of? While your personal connection is the most important, it can help to at least familiarize yourself with some theory on color and dreams. In dreams, red has sometimes been said to symbolize intense feelings. People also tend to associate red with increased activity and intense emotions like anger, passion, determination, and general excitement. Physically, red has a stimulating effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. Learn to trust yourself. You are the expert in regards to your unconscious mind. As dreams are heavily based in personal associations, memories, and relationships, you're the best judge of what symbols in your dreams mean. Do not rely too heavily on outside opinions and research. Allow yourself to interpret the dream based on your own feelings and experiences. Once you've gone through and recorded the dream and your feelings, put it all together. Considering all factors, what do you think the dream means? Let's return to the tent example. For the sake of this example, you're a middle-aged divorced man. Say, in this dream, you felt at peace. The cat you were petting was a cat you had in childhood that died. You used to camp in your backyard as a young boy, sometimes with other children and sometimes alone. Lately, you've been having recurring thoughts about aging. You just turned 40 and are becoming more aware of how quickly time passes. You associate red with your wedding day, as the bridesmaids wore red dresses. Perhaps the red tent dream points to the fact you're missing better times. You may feel you're past your peak in life and long to return to a time of promise and potential. The red in the dream points to your wedding, a time of new beginnings and hope. The dream may be a sign you need to acknowledge and deal with your feelings of depression and regret. Summary:","completion":"In order to interpret a dream, it's important to consider personal associations with symbols and colors within the dream rather than relying solely on universal meanings. In the case of red, it can symbolize intense feelings, increased activity, and strong emotions like anger, passion, and determination. However, your personal connection to the color red may be different. To interpret your dream, follow these steps: 1. Record the dream and your feelings about it. 2. Consider your personal associations with the symbols and colors present in the dream. 3. Reflect on your memories and experiences that may be related to the dream. 4. Don't rely too heavily on outside opinions and research. 5. Trust yourself as the best judge of what the symbols in your dream mean. 6. Combine all the factors and your personal associations to interpret the dream. For example, if you dreamt of a red tent and you are a middle-aged divorced man who associates red with your wedding day, the dream may signify a longing for better times and new beginnings. This could indicate a need to address feelings of depression and regret.

Please answer this question: What legendary island is said to have sunk?","completion":"The legendary island said to have sunk is Atlantis. Atlantis is an ancient mythological island civilization that has intrigued people for centuries. The story of Atlantis first appeared in the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, in his dialogues \\"Timaeus\\" and \\"Critias,\\" written around 360 BCE. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and highly advanced civilization that existed 9,000 years before his own time, which would place it around 9,600 BCE. In these dialogues, Plato stated that Atlantis was located \\"beyond the pillars of Hercules.\\" These pillars were considered to be the boundaries of the \\"known world,\\" and are usually identified today as the Strait of Gibraltar, the narrow passage connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and Morocco. This geographical placement has led to numerous debates and speculations about the exact location of this lost continent or island, with theories ranging from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to the North Sea. Atlantis is portrayed as a highly advanced and technologically sophisticated society, ruled by a wise and benevolent elite. According to the texts, the people of Atlantis enjoyed an elaborate system of canals, harbors, and bridges. They had a strong navy and possessed advanced engineering techniques, which allowed them to build magnificent temples, palaces, and public spaces. The natural resources on the island were said to be abundant, providing its people with enormous wealth and prosperity. Despite this great wealth and advanced knowledge, the Atlanteans are said to have become increasingly corrupt and power-hungry. They began to expand their empire with conquests throughout the ancient world, leading to wars with other civilizations. In the end, their hubris contributed to their eventual downfall. According to Plato's account, the Greek gods, led by Zeus, decided to punish the people of Atlantis for their hubris, greed and corruption. In a single day and night of catastrophic earthquakes and floods, the entire island of Atlantis sank beneath the waves and was lost forever. The story of this lost civilization has captivated the imaginations of scholars, historians, and treasure hunters for centuries. Some believe that the story of Atlantis was a cautionary tale told by Plato to demonstrate the dangers of excessive pride, while others see it as an allegory for the ancient struggle between the forces of good and evil. However, despite extensive research and numerous attempts to locate the lost island, no definitive evidence has ever been found to support the existence of Atlantis. As such, the story is largely considered a myth or legend rather than historical fact. Over the years, a wide range of theories has been proposed to explain the story's origins, including the possibility that it was based on ancient memories of genuine cataclysmic events, such as the destruction of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, or the volcanic eruption of Thera (now known as Santorini). Regardless of its factual basis, the story of Atlantis continues to enchant and fascinate people today, inspiring countless works of literature, movies, and even expeditions in search of this legendary sunken island."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013 and for several months, Greece produced more than 20% of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"In the year 2008, which is eight years after the year 2000, the European Union's energy production from renewable sources stood at an average of 10%. This figure is derived from the context provided, which states that renewable energy accounted for 10% of the EU's energy production in 2008. It is important to note that this percentage varied among EU member states, with some countries producing more or less than the average amount from renewable energy sources. In the case of Greece, it is mentioned that 8% of the country's total energy consumption in 2008 came from renewable sources, a 0.8% increase compared to the 7.2% in 2006. The majority of Greece's renewable energy was generated from biomass and waste recycling, with only 10% coming from solar power. The European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy set a target for Greece to reach 18% of its energy production from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013, Greece achieved more than 20% of its electricity production from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants for several months, indicating progress toward meeting their target. Greece is unique compared to some other EU countries in that it does not have any nuclear power plants in operation. However, in 2009, the Academy of Athens suggested beginning research into the possibility of introducing nuclear power plants to the country as an additional energy source. In conclusion, in 2008, the European Union's energy production from renewable sources averaged 10%, with Greece accounting for 8% of its total energy consumption from renewable sources. Greece's efforts to increase its renewable energy production were evident through its progress in 2013 when more than 20% of its electricity was generated from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"We, as well as the British government, traditionally maintain that such a center is not necessary, as it would unnecessarily duplicate existing structures. In this statement, the speaker expresses that both they and the British government share the traditional opinion that the proposed center is not essential. According to their viewpoint, establishing the center would be an inefficient and unnecessary duplication of resources and structures that are already in place. The concern is that creating another center would lead to wasteful spending and could potentially create confusion or overlap with the roles and responsibilities of existing institutions. The primary argument here is that effective use and allocation of resources, as well as streamlined and efficient communication between organizations, are key to the success of any endeavor. Instead of creating a separate and possibly redundant center, both the speaker and the British government believe it would be more advantageous to focus on optimizing and consolidating the existing structures to better serve their intended purposes. This way, resources and budget allocations can be maximized in order to improve the overall performance, reach, and impact of current institutions. It is crucial, however, to thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of not establishing a new center alongside the assessment of the existing structures. Identifying opportunities for improvement within existing organizations can lead to more effective decision-making and ultimately contribute to better outcomes. There may be shared objectives or unique capabilities that could be better addressed through a collaborative approach with the potential new center. By maintaining this traditional stance against the creation of another center, the goal is to ensure a strong and unified effort without sacrificing valuable resources in the process. However, it is important to keep in mind that new perspectives and approaches can sometimes lead to significant advancements and should not be disregarded outright simply because they deviate from established norms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

London 2012 spokesman Andy Mitchell said: \\"The South Korean flag was shown in the video package on the screen before the kick-off and the North Koreans were naturally very upset about that... \\"A genuine mistake was made for which we apologise.\\" BBC Scotland football reporter Alasdair Lamont said that during the delay to the game the crowd had become frustrated at a lack of information. \\"I don't think there was any reason given the entire time before the kick-off eventually took place as to why there had been a hold-up,\\" he said. \\"They were simply given a couple of messages saying there was 'an issue behind the scenes, we're doing our best to resolve it', and that was basically it.\\" One spectator, Paul, told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"An announcement was made that there was a technical problem behind the scenes, and even then when the players came back on, they came back on for a second warm-up, and quite a large portion of the crowd started booing.\\" North Korea's state news agency KCNA made no mention of the blunder in its report on Thursday of the team's 2-0 victory over Colombia. North Korea will face South Korea in the first round of the men's Olympic table tennis team event after the pair were drawn against each other on Wednesday. 'Value for money' In an interview on BBC Breakfast, asked about benefits to the wider UK from the London 2012 Games, Mr Cameron said: \\"I think we will get value for money as a country.\\" He said that the Games were expected to come in under their ¬£9bn budget, while there were predicted to be \\"¬£13bn in economic benefits from the deals that are going to be done, the extra spending, the extra tourism and all the rest of it\\". The nation would enjoy the physical infrastructure left by the Games, he said, giving the example of the aquatics centre's expected 800,000 visitors a year. \\"But the real legacy is the inspiration to young people who will want to take up sport, who will be inspired by the competitive ethos of the Olympics, who will see Britain at its best,\\" the prime minister said. The opening match in the men's football gets under way at 12:00 BST at Hampden Park when Honduras take on Morocco, followed by Spain v Japan. Matches are also taking place at St James' Park in Newcastle, Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and the City of Coventry Stadium.

It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times. But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10. p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.

Understand the hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the players were told soccer is a game for all genders. This suggests that they were informed soccer is equally suitable for men, women, and anyone else, regardless of their gender. 3. Compare the premise and the hypothesis: The premise and the hypothesis present opposing ideas. The premise implies exclusion of women from soccer, while the hypothesis implies that soccer is for everyone, including women. 4. Evaluate the options: a. Option 1: Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

Read this and answer the question In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighters that are actually fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

Summarize: New York Judge Thomas Griesa said the plan was \\"lawless\\". However, he stopped short of finding the country in contempt of court. Argentina was trying to get around an earlier court ruling banning it from paying interest to investors who had accepted restructured bonds. Mr Griesa ruled in July that the country must first pay the hedge funds holding out for full payment on the bonds on which it defaulted in 2001. \\"I want to be very clear, this proposal is a violation of the current orders of this court... it is illegal and the court directs that it cannot be carried out,\\" Mr Griesa said on Thursday. The hedge funds, which bought Argentina's bonds at a big discount after its economic meltdown and previous default in 2001-02, are owed an estimated 1.3bn (√Ç¬£766m). Argentina has consistently refused to pay them, saying it cannot afford to do so, and called them \\"vultures\\" for refusing to swap their bonds for lesser valued ones. Mr Griesa likened Argentina's stance to a man showing up to complete a house purchase with only 80,000 to buy a 100,000 property and insisting: \\"80,000 is a lot of money and my family is ready to move in\\". \\"He would be laughed out of the neighbourhood,\\" the judge added. On Thursday, Mr Griesa urged the two sides to try and find a compromise. \\"If we can have a process leading to settlement, that is the path that should be taken,\\" the judge said. In July, Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof flew to New York to try to make a deal with the hedge funds. However, the talks broke down, forcing Argentina to default on its debt - its second default in 13 years - thus exacerbating problems in its recession-hit economy. Summary:","completion":"New York Judge Thomas Griesa deemed Argentina's plan to pay interest to investors who accepted restructured bonds as \\"lawless\\" and a violation of a court ruling. Argentina has been attempting to circumvent a previous ruling that requires it to first pay hedge funds holding out for full payment on the bonds it defaulted on in 2001. The holdout hedge funds are owed approximately 1.3bn. Griesa has urged both parties to find a compromise, while Argentina's economy suffers from the repercussions of its second default in 13 years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I also thought I might go to Starbucks , have a coffee ( because a 103 degree day is a great day to go for a coffee ) , and read or journal . why does she want to read or journal at starbucks ?","completion":"The desire to read or journal at Starbucks rather than at home, especially during a break from being a mom, could be attributed to several reasons. Let's explore them in detail: 1. Change of Scenery: Constantly being in the same environment can make a person feel overwhelmed, restless, or even bored. Going to an entirely different place like Starbucks can provide a refreshing change of scenery, offering a fresh perspective and mental clarity. This change can make the experience of reading or journaling much more enjoyable and productive. 2. Escape from Home Responsibilities: Being a mom typically involves a long list of household chores and responsibilities. Escaping to Starbucks allows her to distance herself physically and mentally from these tasks, giving her an opportunity to focus solely on herself and her interests. This uninterrupted time is essential for personal growth, well-being, and self-care. 3. Social Atmosphere: Starbucks is known for its cozy and welcoming atmosphere, which often attracts people who want to work, read, or engage in creative activities in a pleasant environment. Unlike the solitude and peace that home offers, Starbucks has a degree of social interaction that might be appealing for some people. The background chatter, people watching opportunities, and brief interactions can be uplifting and inspiring without needing to focus intently on conversations or socializing. 4. Structure and Routine: Sometimes setting a routine and having a designated place to work or think can increase productivity and focus. Starbucks provides a structured environment where she can designate time specifically for reading or journaling. This helps in creating a disciplined approach to her personal goals. 5. Quality Coffee: Starbucks is famous for its coffee, and enjoying a delicious beverage can make a person feel good and provide a small treat to look forward to. Sitting down with a good coffee in Starbucks might help to set the mood for her reading or journaling session. 6. Me Time: Spending time at Starbucks allows her to have some \\"me time\\", which is crucial for maintaining a balance between her identity as a mom and her individuality. Reading or journaling at Starbucks provides her with an opportunity to reflect on her thoughts, emotions, and aspirations, which may not be easily feasible in the midst of her daily responsibilities as a parent. To sum up, she wants to read or journal at Starbucks because it offers an enjoyable change of scenery, escape from home responsibilities, a pleasant social atmosphere, a structured environment, quality coffee, and an opportunity for much-needed \\"me time\\". These factors play a vital role in making her experience of reading or journaling more enjoyable, effective, and relaxing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard. Every day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, \\"I'm blessed!\\" Then one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was \\"how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?\\" Needless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual. While I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, \\"Today I will give you a dollar.\\" He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.

Summarize the following: The flexible hose will most likely be a rubber hose (sometimes it may be braided steel) leading from the central brake line to the caliper piston in disc brakes or the wheel cylinder in drum brakes. To disconnect the hose, you should remove the retainer clip between the hose and the steel line. Next, you can turn the connector with a wrench until it comes loose. Do not crank too much on these connections. If you do you may bend the metal brake lines and then have to replace them as well. Instead, drain the line by cutting the brake hose and use a torch to heat the connection. This will break it loose and you can remove it. The brake hose may be mounted to the strut or another sturdy point between the central line and the wheel. You will need to locate any such connections by tracing the line from end to end. Loosen and remove any mounting connections you find. Now that the hose is disconnected from the lines to the master cylinder, you need only remove it from the brake itself. To do this you need to loosen the bolt found at the end of the brake line (known as a banjo bolt). This is often done with a 14mm socket or wrench, but the size can vary depending on make and model. There is also a washer on either side of the brake line (between the line and banjo bolt and the line and brake) that needs removed. To attach the new brake hose, you will simply reverse the steps you took to remove the original. This means putting the washers in first, then tightening the banjo bolt at the end of the brake hose. First, attach the retainer clip. This holds the brake hose in place while you make the connection and is usually attached by sliding it into the appropriate holder at the end of the brake hose. Next, fasten the connector between the brake hose and lines leading the the master cylinder. This should be done with a wrench or flare nut wrench. You should also reconnect any brackets that hold the line secure (often found on the struts or other steering component). Bleeding the brakes is necessary to remove air that you have introduced into your brake line. Open up the bleeder cap found on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder and have someone pump the brake to force the air out of the bleeder cap. Wait until you see fluid coming out of the bleeder cap, and then close the cap. There are also pressure bleeders and gravity bleeders available for bleeding brakes.

Felicia suspects she might have eye mites so she goes to doctor Natalie, because Available choices: [i] Felicia is afraid.. [ii] Natalie is afraid..","completion":"[i] Felicia is afraid that the condition might worsen if left untreated. As Felicia enters Dr. Natalie's clinic, she nervously fidgets with her phone. This is her first time visiting an eye specialist, and she's unsure of how the appointment will go. Step 1: Felicia checks in at the reception desk. As a first-time visitor, Felicia must provide her personal and insurance information so that Dr. Natalie's staff can process her paperwork. She fills out the necessary forms as accurately as possible to ensure a smooth experience. Step 2: Felicia waits for her consultation with Dr. Natalie. While Felicia waits in the comfortable waiting area, she tries to calm her nerves by reading a magazine. She knows it's essential to be relaxed during the eye examination, so her symptoms are accurately assessed. Step 3: Dr. Natalie calls Felicia into her examination room. When it's time for her examination, Dr. Natalie greets Felicia warmly and invites her into the examination room. Felicia begins to feel more at ease thanks to Dr. Natalie's welcoming demeanor. Step 4: Felicia discusses her concerns with Dr. Natalie. Dr. Natalie begins by asking Felicia about the symptoms she's experiencing, such as itching, redness, or persistent discomfort. Felicia explains that she's had a growing discomfort in her eyes and has been feeling increasingly self-conscious about the redness. Step 5: Dr. Natalie conducts a thorough eye examination. Taking Felicia's concerns seriously, Dr. Natalie uses specialized equipment to examine her eyes closely. This includes using a biomicroscope, which enables her to have a magnified look at the eye structure, especially focusing on the eyelids, lashes, and the surface of the eye. Step 6: Dr. Natalie determines a diagnosis. After carefully examining Felicia's eyes, Dr. Natalie determines that Felicia does have eye mites, also known as Demodex mites. As a knowledgeable and caring specialist, she reassures Felicia that this condition is treatable. Step 7: Dr. Natalie recommends a treatment plan. Dr. Natalie outlines a comprehensive treatment plan for Felicia, which includes an antiparasitic medication for the mites and advice on maintaining proper eyelid hygiene. She also prescribes eye drops to relieve the redness and inflammation. Step 8: Felicia follows the treatment plan diligently. Grateful for Dr. Natalie's expertise, Felicia commits to following her prescribed treatment plan, taking the medications as advised and maintaining good eyelid hygiene. Over time, Felicia's symptoms subside, and her eyes return to their usual healthy state. This experience not only helps Felicia overcome her fear of visiting an eye specialist but also strengthens her understanding of the importance of regular eye care."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: The Cardiff University study found levels last year were broadly the same as in 2014. Previously, numbers had dropped each year since 2008. But the study found there was an 8% rise in victims over the age of 50. The survey collected data from A&E departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres. Last month the Home Office launched a crime reduction strategy which it said would make the most of new technology. An estimated 210,000 people attended hospital emergency departments for injuries as a result of violence last year. According to the survey it was the first year since 2008 that there was \\"no real change\\" in the figures, after successive annual falls. Prof Jonathan Shepherd, director of the Violence Research Group at Cardiff University, said: \\"After successive annual falls in overall levels of violence in England and Wales, this is the first time since 2008 violence in England and Wales serious enough to result in hospital treatment shows no real change. \\"This finding is also consistent with the latest report from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which also found that rates of violent incidents were no different in the year ending September 2015, compared with the previous 12 months. \\"It is possible that the long steady decline in violence in England and Wales has come to an end.\\" The researchers said one possible reason was that local authorities and police were spending less money on monitoring in real time footage from CCTV cameras which it is thought can help prevent violent incidents from escalating.

In this case, it is used to talk about the existence of examples of multicultural countries and European states. - fast so viele (almost as many) - The word \\"fast\\" means \\"almost\\" in German, and \\"so viele\\" means \\"as many\\". Put together, \\"fast so viele\\" means \\"almost as many\\" and is used to compare the number of examples of multicultural countries with that of European states. - Beispiele f√ºr (examples of) - The phrase \\"Beispiele f√ºr\\" is the German equivalent of \\"examples of\\". It is used to describe the instances or examples of a specific topic or subject, such as multicultural countries in this case. - multikulturelle L√§nder (multicultural countries) - A multicultural country is a nation with a diverse population comprising various ethnicities, religions, and cultural backgrounds. In German, \\"multikulturelle\\" means \\"multicultural\\", and \\"L√§nder\\" means \\"countries\\". Combined, \\"multikulturelle L√§nder\\" means \\"multicultural countries\\". - wie es (as there are) - The word \\"wie\\" means \\"as\\" in German, and \\"es\\" means \\"there\\" or \\"it\\". In this context, \\"wie es\\" is used to compare the examples of multicultural countries with that of European states. - europ√§ische Staaten (European states) - European states are the countries situated in the continent of Europe. In German, \\"europ√§ische\\" means \\"European\\", and \\"Staaten\\" means \\"states\\" or \\"countries\\". Put together, \\"europ√§ische Staaten\\" means \\"European states\\". So, by putting all of these words and phrases together, we have \\"Es gibt fast so viele Beispiele f√ºr multikulturelle L√§nder wie es europ√§ische Staaten gibt.\\" as the translation for \\"There are almost as many examples of multicultural countries as there are European states.\\" in German."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers.

After a scoreless first quarter, Cleveland trailed in the second quarter as Bengals kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 29-yard and a 38-yard field goal, along with QB Carson Palmer completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and RB Kenny Watson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Browns began to rally as QB Derek Anderson completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards for the only score of the period.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus ‚Äî a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House ‚Äî had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow ‚Äî it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Question: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. Scientists originally thought that _ .

Baking soda absorbs and neutralizes all kinds of unpleasant smells and is a great ingredient to get rid of unwanted garlicky odors that may have been worked into a cutting board or other kitchen utensil. Combine the baking soda and water in a small bowl. Stir them together with a spoon until a thick, grainy paste forms. If not all of the baking soda is absorbed into the water, add a few more drops. If you‚Äôve used, for example, a cutting board or measuring spoons with garlic and they still smell, try getting the smell off with the baking soda paste. Scoop the paste onto the surface of the utensil. Rub the paste into the object. Do this for 1‚Äì2 minutes to make sure that the baking soda paste eradicates all of the garlic odor. Some kitchen utensils may have the smell of garlic deeply engrained in them. In this case, if you have a lemon on hand, try cutting it in half and using half the lemon to rub the paste into your garlicky kitchen utensil. The lemon‚Äôs acidity will help further neutralize the garlic odor. Turn on your kitchen sink‚Äôs tap and hold the cutting board, measuring spoon, or other kitchen item beneath the running water. Rub 1 hand back and forth across the paste-covered surface until you‚Äôve rinsed off all of the paste. Set your utensil in a drying rack and give it 2‚Äì3 hours to dry. Once it‚Äôs dry, sniff the cutting board. The unpleasant garlic smell should be gone! If you‚Äôre out of baking soda, vinegar works equally well as a deodorizer. You can use it to clean the same items that you can clean with baking soda. Just pour a little vinegar onto a clean sponge and scrub it across the surface of whatever kitchen items have an unpleasant garlicky smell. This works well on plastic cutting boards, frying pans, silverware, and even your stovetop. Also try pouring vinegar into a plastic spray bottle and spritzing it across larger items that smell like garlic. This works well for larger cutting boards and stovetops.

Usage: The sample input \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Å—ã–ø–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∑–ª–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" is in Russian and contains the emotion label \\"anger\\". This meets the criteria because it follows the instruction of providing a text in Russian that contains one emotion label from the provided list. Part #2: You need to output the incorrect emotion label, which is irrelevant to the input text. Usage: Assume the input only contains an implication of 'anger'. In this case, any other emotion label like 'joy', 'sadness', 'surprise', 'fear' would be irrelevant.

For example, an output of 'joy' meets this criterion because it contains only one emotion label. Part #4: Your answer (ii) should be unambiguous. Usage: Your answer should be clear and not open to more than one interpretation. For instance, outputting 'joy' is unambiguous because it is a clear, singular emotion label. Outputs such as 'joy or sadness' or 'maybe fear' do not meet this criterion because they are either providing more than one emotion label or are unclear about which label is the irrelevant one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: sunlight streams through a window into a room","completion":"In the given sentence \\"sunlight streams through a window into a room,\\" some of the most important words include sunlight, streams, window, and room. Each of these words holds significance in the sentence and contributes to the overall meaning and imagery. 1. Sunlight: This represents the natural light emitted by the sun. Sunlight is the primary source of light and warmth in our world, playing a crucial role in plant photosynthesis, which in turn provides oxygen and sustenance, ultimately supporting all life on earth. In the given sentence, sunlight is the key component that sets the scene and creates the atmosphere. 2. Streams: The verb \\"streams\\" indicates the continuous flow or movement of sunlight. This word provides the reader with a visual representation of the flow of sunlight, creating an image of streaks or rays of light that pour through the window. By using \\"streams,\\" the sentence is able to convey the idea that sunlight enters the room in a gentle, fluid manner, which, in turn, helps build the scene's overall atmosphere. 3. Window: A window acts as an opening or portal in the walls of a building, allowing light to enter and offering a view of the exterior environment. In this context, the window serves as the conduit through which sunlight streams, shaping how the light enters the room and facilitating the connection between the indoors and the outdoors. The window plays a crucial role in the sentence because it acts as a frame, directing the reader's attention to the main action and determining how sunlight interacts with the room. 4. Room: A room is an enclosed space within a building, usually designated for a specific purpose, such as living, working, or dining. In this sentence, the room represents the interior area receiving the sunlight pouring in through the window. The term \\"room\\" helps establish the context within which the other words operate, setting the stage for the image being conveyed. In summary, the words \\"sunlight,\\" \\"streams,\\" \\"window,\\" and \\"room\\" work together to create a vivid image of a space illuminated by the natural light of the sun. These key terms contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence, helping to establish the atmosphere, convey motion, and provide a sense of space. This allows the reader to visualize and appreciate the scene described in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

However, the most immediate prerequisite to watching a movie, irrespective of other factors, is indeed \\"picking a movie.\\" Without choosing a movie, the act of watching cannot take place. This step is the direct precursor and enabler of the activity, making \\"pick a movie\\" a valid and indeed essential answer to the question \\"What does Addison need to do before this?\\" It is also the most logical step, as Addison might not be able to arrange the rest of the activities without first knowing what kind of movie she will be watching (which could influence the kind of atmosphere, snacks, or comfort level she might prefer).

This could involve browsing through a list of available titles on her streaming service, consulting movie reviews, seeking recommendations from friends, or picking a movie from a collection she already owns. Picking a movie might also involve choosing the genre, duration, actors, directors, or themes she's in the mood for. Once she has picked a movie, other preparatory steps may follow, but they all hinge on this first essential step: picking the movie. This vital stage sets the course for everything else that will follow in her movie-watching experience.

Background: Carroll was born in Joliet, Illinois on May 18, 1945. His father worked in a coal processing plant. The family moved to San Diego in 1954 where Carroll grew up. He describes his early years in Ocean Beach as an ideal childhood. Context: Carroll did not believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent god. However, in his essay \\"Why I am not an atheist\\", Carroll described his dislike of the term \\"atheist\\" because he feels that the term is being exploited by theists and used as a straw man argument. He felt that the term implies a dogmatic set of beliefs and carries its own share of negative baggage. So, Carroll suggested that atheists might as well adopt the term \\"Brights\\" with all its negative connotations. The only religion that Carroll found attractive after abandoning Catholicism, despite never following it, is Buddhism as taught by the Dalai Lama. Carroll has always maintained the opinion that people have to be more skeptical of religion than they are now. He said in multiple interviews that religion is an area that skeptics don't target enough, and that pure faith is winning the race against critical thinking. Carroll tended to have a moderate outlook on religion. He believed that religion has a role to play in people's lives and he didn't condemn religion for terrorism. When asked about the relationship between violence and religion he said that he can't recall anything negative about his religious upbringing, and that maybe Catholicism can provide more good than harm. He didn't believe religion causes wars, he rather believed that it serves as an excuse for people who will go to war regardless of religion's existence. Carroll believed that some people rely on religion as their only source of morality and as a source of comfort. However, he found it distressing that some people are unable to find meaning in their lives without religion. In an interview with Beyond a Doubt he said \\"There is nothing dull about a life without fairies, Easter bunnies, devils, ghosts, magic crystals, etc. Life is only boring to boring people.\\" Question: How did he feel about buddhism?.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. What is the relationship between 'tyler hamilton ' and 'canada'?

The tweet discusses a few different events that the author seems to have enjoyed or is looking forward to. There might also be hints of a neutral sentiment in some parts of the tweet. Here's a breakdown of the individual sentiments present within the tweet: 1. \\"Long day at Morton's Poker Tourney\\" ‚Äì This statement can be considered slightly neutral, as it mentions that the day was long, which could imply fatigue or potentially a tiring experience. However, it is important to consider the context of the events being described to gauge the sentiment accurately. 2. \\"lots of raised for great cause\\" ‚Äì This phrase implies a strong positive sentiment.

To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. But I can use this background: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... What is an answer for this question: Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A? Answer:","completion":"Case B would likely show less developed pheromone chemical signals than case A. This is because the background information states that the use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants (case A) than in other hymenopteran groups (case B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was a cold night in Washington, D. C., and I was heading back to the hotel when a man approached me. He asked if l would give him some money so he could get something to eat. I'd read the signs \\"Don't give money to beggars.\\" So I shook my head and kept walking. I wasn't prepared for a reply, but he said, \\"I really am homeless and I really am hungry! You can come with me and watch me eat!\\" But I kept on walking. The incident bothered me for the rest of the week. I had money in my pocket and it wouldn't have killed me to hand over a buck or two even if he had been lying. Flying back to Anchorage, I couldn't help thinking of him. I tried to rationalize my failure to help by thinking government agencies, churches and charities were there to feed him. Besides, you're not supposed to give money to beggars. Somewhere over Seattle, I started to write my weekly garden column for The Anchorage Daily News. _ , I came up with an idea. Bean's Cafe, the soup kitchen in Anchorage, feeds hundreds of hungry Alaskans every day. Why not try to get all my readers to plant one row in their gardens dedicated to Bean's? Dedicate a row and take it down to Bean's. Clean and simple. The idea began to take off. Readers would fax or call me when they got something in their garden. Those who only grew flowers donated them. Food for the spirit. In 1995, the Garden Writers Association of America held their annual convention in Anchorage and after learning of Anchorage's program, Plant a Row for Bean's became Plant a Row for the Hungry. The original idea was to have every member of the Garden Writers Association of America write or talk about planting a row for the hungry sometime during the month of April. As more and more people started working with the Plant a Row idea, new changes appeared unexpectedly. Many companies gave free seed to customers and displayed the logo, which also appeared in national gardening publications.

Instead, the idea came to the author while writing his garden column on a flight back to Anchorage after reflecting on the beggar incident and thinking about the support systems that were supposed to help the homeless and hungry. The Plant a Row program was inspired by the author's desire to do something to help people in need, and it evolved into a nationwide campaign with the involvement of the Garden Writers Association of America and various gardening companies and publications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Monday night's grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, led to riots in the Missouri city. Although Michael Brown's family, President Barack Obama, and authorities called for peaceful protests, the Ferguson was soon out of control. The riots saw a return to the looting, fires and property damages which took place on a smaller scale in August, immediately after the shooting of Brown. Scroll down for video. Damage done: Two buildings still smoulder after the riots that ravaged Ferguson, Missouri overnight. Before: A satellite image taken by Google in September 2012 show the buildings intact. As the sun rose on Tuesday, the cityscape of Ferguson looked worlds away from satellite and Google Street View snaps taken just months earlier. Pictures from yesterday in comparison with images from before, tracked down byThe Wall Street Journal, show the damage done. Last night, tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict. However, despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General said on Monday. The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force. Beauty lost: A beauty supply store has been left in ruins after Monday night's riots. True beauty: A Google Street View snap from 2010 shows the shop in its original state. Burned out: A building in Ferguson only has its four walls left after being destroyed by fire. Better times: The building, which appears to be a shop, is pictured on Google earlier this year. The fire at the local Little Ceasars restaurant left the big orange sign in a melted lump on the ground. Neighborhood joint: There is no sign of its former glory, captured by Google in August 2012. Distraught: The manager of the Little Caesar's said he understood the protesters were angry but added: 'Speaking your mind - that‚Äôs America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...' More destruction: The arson frenzy also hit South Florissant Street, about a mile away. This branch of Little Casear's was burned out. Et tu: The neighboring antique shop to the Little Caesar's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit Ferguson. Long way back: A woman stops to take a picture using her phone of the damage done. Still intact: The local Clean World Laundromat was still standing on Monday morning. Residents on the streets told MailOnline that the wreckage to Ferguson was so bad that it looked like ‚ÄòFerganistan‚Äô. Another said that it ‚Äòlooked like Iraq‚Äô. Almost every building along South Florissant Street, where the Ferguson police station is located, had been ransacked or vandalised. Tony Koenig and his brother Ray, 38 and 40, had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a Mexican restaurant run by a friend. Tony said: ‚ÄòI have lived in Ferguson for 38 years and I have never seen anything like this. They just want street justice and they don‚Äôt care about how they get it. ‚ÄòThis young generation. I cannot understand why they do what they do. The parents are to blame. When me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect, and that doesn‚Äôt happen these days. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down. We don‚Äôt need this‚Äô. Their friend Drew Canaday, who was also helping them, lives in the street next to South Florissant and said that it was ‚Äòlike a war‚Äô the night before.

I have been racially profiled myself,' said Jason Westbrook of Ferguson as he took video of the burning of the Title Max Loans business on West Florissant.

Burning: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree. Burned out: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree. Inspection: The scale of destruction became clear today after a night which saw fires raised across the St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Attacked: McDonald's on West Florissant was smashed up although not set on fire. It had previously (right) avoided damage. Devastated: A gas station was among the targets of the violence. Today property manager Terri Willits witnessed the destruction. Crime scene: Much of West Florissant was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene. He said: ‚ÄòThese young people are so used to instant gratification, they want stuff now. They are too immature to understand that stuff takes time. ‚ÄòEspecially something this big. It takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that‚Äôs compromise. ‚ÄòThese people don‚Äôt want to wait.

The manager of the restaurant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals, said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild. The manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‚Äòa lot of money‚Äô.

Now, let's add the numbers that aren't multiplied by o together: -606 - 676 + 322 = -960 So, our equation becomes: -294 * o = -310 * o - 960 3. Now, let's move the terms with o to one side by adding 310 * o to both sides: (-294 * o) + (310 * o) = (-310 * o + 310 * o) - 960 After adding, we get: 16 * o = -960 4.

To provide a more detailed and informative answer, let's explore various subjects and topics that Ashkenazi Jews study outside the Yeshiva. Outside the Yeshiva framework, Ashkenazi Jews engage in studies that span across various subjects, both religious and secular. Here are some topics that are commonly studied: 1. Jewish Philosophy: Many Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish philosophy, which deals with questions concerning the nature of God, the purpose of life, and the relationship between God and the world. Essential works in Jewish philosophy include those of Maimonides, a prominent Jewish philosopher of the Middle Ages, as well as contemporary Jewish philosophers like Yeshayahu Leibowitz and Emmanuel Levinas. 2. Jewish History: Some Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish history, which traces the Jewish people's experiences through time both religiously and culturally. This subject covers historical periods that include the biblical era, the Second Temple period, the Jewish diaspora, and modern Jewish history. 3. Hebrew Language: The study of the Hebrew language, both classical and modern, is essential to understanding Jewish religious texts and cultural works. Ashkenazi Jews often engage in learning Hebrew to strengthen their connection to Jewish traditions and enhance their prayer experiences. It also allows them to communicate with Israeli Jews and understand Israeli literature, film, and music. 4. Jewish Literature: Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish literature, which encompasses a myriad of literary works produced by Jewish authors throughout history. This may include religious texts, poetry, novels, and short stories that reflect Jewish culture, themes, and values. 5. Jewish Arts and Culture: Many Ashkenazi Jews delve into various aspects of Jewish arts and culture, including visual arts, music, theater, and film. These cultural expressions provide insights into Jewish history and experience and reveal how Jewish values are communicated through artistic mediums. 6. Jewish Law (Halakhah): Although Yeshiva education focuses mainly on Jewish law, some Ashkenazi Jews may continue studying halakhic texts and traditions outside the formal Yeshiva setting. 7. Secular Studies: Ashkenazi Jews also engage in secular studies, which may include subjects such as science, technology, engineering, math, humanities, and social sciences. Some attend secular universities and pursue careers in various professional fields. In conclusion, Ashkenazi Jews study a wide array of topics outside the Yeshiva framework, which extend beyond religious subjects to encompass secular studies and cultural interests. These studies enhance their understanding of the Jewish tradition, history, and values, while also promoting personal growth and contributing to modern Jewish life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. joints become inflammed and painful Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"Joints become inflamed and painful. It is a common issue that many people experience, and it can have a significant impact on their daily lives. Inflammation and pain in joints can be caused by various factors, including injury, overuse, autoimmune diseases, and age-related changes. Below is a detailed explanation of why joints become inflamed and painful, as well as potential ways to alleviate the symptoms. 1. Injury: Injuries to the joints can range from minor sprains, strains, or tendonitis to more severe cases like dislocations, fractures, or ligament tears. When an injury occurs, the body's natural response is to release chemicals that cause inflammation and swelling. This is a crucial step in the healing process, but the inflammation itself can be painful. 2. Overuse: When joints are subjected to repetitive movements or excessive strain over time, the structures surrounding the joint, such as the cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, can become irritated, leading to inflammation and pain. This is commonly seen in athletes who participate in high-impact activities, like running or jumping, or in individuals who engage in heavy physical labor for their occupation. 3. Autoimmune diseases: Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus, can also cause joint pain and inflammation. In these disorders, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, leading to inflammation in the affected areas. This immune response can directly damage the synovial membrane and other joint structures, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness. 4. Age-related changes: Over time, the cartilage that cushions the joints can wear down due to aging and everyday wear-and-tear. When the cartilage breaks down, the bones in the joint start to rub against each other, causing friction, inflammation, and pain. This degenerative process is commonly seen in osteoarthritis, which is the most prevalent form of arthritis. To help alleviate joint pain and inflammation, consider the following: 1. Rest: Giving the affected joint adequate rest will help minimize further strain and prevent worsening of the symptoms. Elevating the joint can also help reduce swelling. 2. Ice and heat therapy: Applying ice packs to the affected joint can help reduce inflammation and numb the area, providing pain relief. On the other hand, heat therapy, such as warm compresses or heating pads, can help relax the muscles and improve blood circulation in the area, promoting healing. 3. Medications: Over-the-counter medications, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or pain relievers like acetaminophen, can help alleviate joint pain and inflammation. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before starting any medication regimen. 4. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can design personalized exercise programs to help maintain or improve your joint flexibility, strength, and range of motion while reducing pain and inflammation. 5. Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining a healthy weight and incorporating low-impact exercises, like swimming or cycling, can help reduce stress on the joints, lessening pain and inflammation. 6. Alternative therapies: Some individuals find relief from joint pain and inflammation through alternative therapies like acupuncture, massage therapy or chiropractic care. However, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider before trying any alternative treatment. In conclusion, joint inflammation and pain can severely impact an individual's life. Recognizing the underlying cause, whether it's due to injury, overuse, autoimmune disease, or age-related changes, is vital for identifying the appropriate treatment to help alleviate symptoms and improve the person's quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a sub-branch of the Turkic language family. The Turkic language family is one of the largest language families in the world and includes languages like Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, and Kazakh among others. Turkish is an agglutinative language - which means most words are formed by adding suffixes to base words - and its grammar is largely based on suffixation and infixation. The Turkish language has a rich array of vocabulary, much of which is derived from Persian and Arabic, though modern Turkish also borrows from French and English. Turkish uses the Latin script as its writing system, but it was written with the Arabic script before 1928. Modern Turkish rose during the period known as the Tanzimat era of the Ottoman Empire (around 1839-1876). In the early 20th century Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, initiated a language reform to replace many of the Arabic and Persian words with Turkish equivalents, and to use the Latin script instead of Arabic script. This was done in order to make the language easier to read and write and to foster a stronger national identity. The result of this reform is the modern Turkish language spoken today. Turkish is a unique and fascinating language, offering interesting insights not only linguistically, but also historically and culturally, due to Turkey's position straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, acting as a bridge between Western and Eastern cultures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Who did Seleucus invade?\\" Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Seleucus invaded the territories of Lysimachus in Asia Minor. In the given context, following the death of Cassander in 298 BCE, Demetrius managed to seize the Macedonian throne and conquer Thessaly and central Greece. However, his reign was short-lived when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon in 288 BCE, dividing the kingdom between themselves. Demetrius later shifted his focus to central Greece, the northern Peloponnese, and eventually Asia Minor, waging war on Lysimachus' territories in Ionia. Despite Demetrius' initial successes, he was eventually forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE and subsequently died in captivity. Seizing the opportunity, Seleucus invaded Lysimachus' territories in Asia Minor, resulting in Lysimachus' defeat and death in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium near Sardis. Seleucus then set his sights on Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, expanding his empire further. However, Seleucus' ambitious plans were thwarted when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who then declared himself king of Macedon. Ptolemy's reign was also temporary, as the Gauls invaded Macedon in 279, leading to his death and the descent of the region into chaos. Antigonus II Gonatas eventually emerged as the new king of Macedon, successfully invading Thrace in 277 and defeating a large force of Gauls. In summary, Seleucus invaded the territories of Lysimachus in Asia Minor following Demetrius' surrender and Lysimachus' subsequent defeat at the Battle of Corupedium. This action not only resulted in the expansion of the Seleucid Empire but also set the stage for a series of conflicts and power struggles in the region over the following years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now I will analyze the options given. Option A: Yes This option would mean that the person's presence is needed or useful in the situation, and there is a specific reason or condition for them to be there. Option B: It is not possible to tell This option would mean that it is unclear whether or not their presence is needed or useful, and/or if there is any specific reason for them to be there.

Chapter VII. MAGGIE IS VERY NAUGHTY. As soon as the children reached the open air Tom said, \\"Here, Lucy, you come along with me,\\" and walked off to the place where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in existence. Lucy was naturally pleased that Cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string, when the toad was safe down the area, with an iron grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the sight also, especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy loved Maggie's stories about the live things they came upon by accident--how Mrs. Earwig had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad made her run back to Maggie and say, \\"Oh, there is such a big, funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see.\\" Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deep frown. She was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry, by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn't mind it.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who spent virtually his entire life in Paris? from the following article ? Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ Éa Ål val…ëÃÉt…õÃÉ alk…ëÃÉ]; 30 November 1813 ‚Äì 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eug√®ne Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions ‚Äì virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4‚Äì7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8‚Äì10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son √âlie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

It is very different from the movie, so I am assuming it is a synopsis of the book, which preceded the movie and which I didn't read. Charlie is about 18 in the movie (he graduates high school and is planning to start college in the fall) and Sam is 11, before the movie advances 5 years. The details of the car crash below are very different. Charlie agrees to drop Sam off at a friend's house on his way to a party, the last before his friend leaves for boot camp. Charlie is stopped with the wheels turned left, waiting for a lull in the traffic so he can turn left, when a car rear-ends him, sending him into the left lane, where an 18-wheeler then crashes into the passenger side of the car. Charlie becomes the caretaker of the cemetery - not an undertaker. When Tess is \\"in between,\\" she notices that she can't see her reflection in a window (not the water.) When Charlie doesn't make it back to the cemetery by sunset, because he is looking for Tess and her boat, Sam goes into the light. After Tess's boat flips over, she is not hanging upside down. Charlie finds her lying on nearby rocks. Tess recovers from the boat accident and goes home, before Charlie is let out of the hospital. Charlie doesn't become a paramedic. Charlie goes to the woods by the cemetery to say goodbye to Sam before he and Tess sail around the world. He can no longer see Sam. It's not clear if he can hear him or not. Sam is not upset that Charlie didn't make it back that other night. He says it was time, that crossing over is better than he could have imagined.Charlie St. Cloud (age 15) and Sam (12) are two brothers with a love so strong, no force can separate them. When their mom leaves Charlie to babysit Sam, they decide to go to watch a 1991 Red Sox baseball game in Boston against the New York Yankees with their pet beagle, Oscar.

Dr. Raymond Cocteau, a genius, charismatic visionary and idealistic scientist, runs the city as its unopposed ruler. Through his powerful corporation, Cocteau Industries, he has successfully managed to eliminate crime, poverty, and pollution by using advanced technology that puts inhabitants under constant surveillance and control. The city, seemingly free from suffering and chaos, is hailed as a futuristic utopia. Dr. Cocteau has become an icon, with his face displayed on holographic billboards and his voice streamed through every corner of the city. However, not everyone is content with Cocteau's rule. On the outskirts of San Angeles, a group of rebels, led by the charismatic and resourceful Morgan Blake, refuse to conform to Cocteau's vision of utopia and seek a world with genuine elements of freedom and individuality. Meanwhile, Luke Jennings, a private investigator who discovered Cocteau's darkest secret - a series of highly classified human experiments in an attempt to create a 'perfect' human - unwittingly finds himself caught up in the city's political struggle. Luke joins forces with Morgan and the rebels to expose the truth behind San Angeles and bring Cocteau's corrupt regime to an end. To prevent the truth from coming out, Dr. Cocteau unleashes his highly advanced security forces led by his top enforcer, Cyrus. As the rebels get closer to the hidden laboratory containing the evidence they need, Cyrus and his team hunt them down ruthlessly. As the movie heads towards an intense climax, Luke and Morgan succeed in infiltrating the laboratory and uncover disturbing test subjects who are part human and part machine. During the final battle, the rebels manage to broadcast Cocteau's dark secret to the entire city, causing the citizens to revolt against Cocteau's control. The film concludes with Dr. Cocteau being captured and arrested for his crimes, with his previous loyal followers realizing the shocking truth. San Angeles is now liberated from oppression, and the people begin the long journey of rebuilding their society on a foundation of regained freedom and self-determination. \\"San Angeles Utopia\\" is an engaging and fast-paced movie with themes focusing on the human spirit, the quest for freedom, and the consequences of playing \\"God\\".

Write a title for this article: BY Peter Botte DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Sunday, January 30th 2011, 4:00 AM Jorge Posada√Ç tried to play the good soldier in his first public comments this winter. He said Saturday night that his switch from behind the plate to full-time DH in 2011 \\"is what it is,\\" while also playing the \\"whatever's best for the team\\" card. But the Yankees' longtime backstop also admitted later that he's keeping his mitt broken in \\"just in case,\\" indicating he hasn't fully come to terms with being phased out of the position he's owned since the late '90s. \\"I'll catch. I'll catch. I'll catch this year,\\" Posada said before Bernie Williams' charity dinner for the Hillside Food Outreach in New Rochelle. \\"I'll DH and then they're going to want me to catch one of those days. I'm keeping an open mind. I would love to catch. I'm training like I always do, and if I have to catch, I'll catch.\\" Posada was responding to GM Brian Cashman, who earlier this week said Posada shouldn't expect to be anything more than the Yanks' full-time designated hitter and their \\"emergency catcher\\" in 2011. Cashman met with Posada - who Saturday night claimed his surgically repaired left knee is 100% - in November to inform him of the career change. The Yanks then added former Dodgers backstop Russell Martin to share catching duties with either Francisco Cervelli or rookies Jesus Montero and Austin Romine. \\"I can't complain. I always like to catch, I'm used to catching, but if they want me to DH to help out the team, you have to do that,\\" Posada said. \\"It is what it is. I look forward to everything I do. I try to help out the team, and if that's going to help out the team and that's what they want, I'm OK with it.\\" Posada, 39, also said the transition probably is \\"going to be toughest during the season,\\" especially the mental adjustment to remain involved in the game without playing defensively. \\"When you're a catcher and try to catch, but you can't and you try to DH, it's tough, it's a struggle,\\" Posada said. \\"But going into a season and knowing you're going to be a DH, I have to look for a routine. It's not easy to be a DH. I have to find a nice little routine that I can get used to and have a good season.\\" Still, he also acknowledged that such a move probably means he \\"won't be as beat up\\" from the usual wear and tear of catching duties. After batting just .248 with 18 homers and 57 RBI in 451 plate appearances during an injury-plagued 2010, he is entering the final season of a four-year, 52 million contract. \\"I would like to keep my doors open, I would like if I feel good and feel like I can do it and having fun, I would like to keep going,\\" Posada said. \\"I love playing the game. I just hope that everything stays healthy.\\" The Yankees' handling of Posada is part of an offseason in which they also engaged in contentious contract relations with Derek Jeter while preparing for the possibility that Andy Pettitte might not return for a 17th season. Posada said he's talked and texted often with Pettitte, before adding, \\"I haven't asked him anything about baseball. I just want him to make the decision. ...Whatever it is, honestly, we're going to support it. Andy is a very valuable guy for us. If he wants to be home, obviously he has the reasons to be home, but we need him.\\" Even if Posada and other members of the old guard won't be needed in their accustomed roles forever. \\"We're getting old,\\" Posada joked. \\"It's tough, it's a business. We have to keep performing, keep doing well, so the decisions are tougher. But we understand it.\\"","completion":"Title: Navigating Change: Jorge Posada's Transition from Catcher to Designated Hitter and the Yankees' Evolving Dynamics"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Given the question: This article: By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub‚Äîthe state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)‚Äîwho first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail‚Äîexpanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries‚Äîto its list of national water trails. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.A 1991 agreement between the City of... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that named the river that had cleanup efforts begin in the 1930s get a American Heritage River?, what is it ?

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting ‚Äî later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. Question: \\"The main country that influenced Japan in the region\\" Answer: \\"Hong Kong\\" Is this answer correct? -no -yes...I think the answer is","completion":"No. The correct answer is \\"China.\\" In the text, it is mentioned that Chinese Buddhism was introduced to Japan, and Japanese monks, scholars, and artists traveled to China to study their religion, history, music, literature, and painting. Also, through Prince Shotoku, the Japanese imperial court adopted Chinese patterns of centralized government and used the Chinese calendar. These examples show that China was the main country that influenced Japan in the region.

A perennial loser for years, the team's manager Joe McGrath (Strother Martin) has resorted to extreme cost-cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. Dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. During a hopeless season, the Chiefs pick up the Hanson Brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. Horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, Dunlop initially chooses not to play them. When it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, Dunlop grows concerned about the team's future. He makes several attempts to learn the identity of the team's anonymous owner (a running gag throughout the film), but is deftly deflected by McGrath each time. When McGrath accompanies them on an away game, top scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) overhears him attempting to get a job with another team. After Braden relays this information to his teammates, Dunlop confronts McGrath, who confirms that the Chiefs will fold at the end of the season. Determined to save the team at all costs, Dunlop starts provoking fights at games to secure goals and the Chiefs start to win games. In a moment of desperation, he lets the Hansons play and discovers that their aggressive fighting style enthralls the fans. He begins retooling the team as a goon squad in the Hansons' image and attendance quickly increases. Capitalizing on this growing interest, he plants a false story with eccentric sports news writer Dickie Dunn (M.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Sad News During Ramadan: People Hurt and Leaders Need to Help Once upon a time in a far away land, there was a special month called Ramadan. During Ramadan, many people who followed a religion called Islam, tried to be extra good and kind to each other. They would also not eat or drink during the day, and only eat and drink when the sun went down. This was like an important challenge for them to show their love to their God. But this year, during Ramadan, there was some very sad news. Some bad people decided to fight and hurt each other. This made many people very sad, because they only wanted to focus on being good during this special month. You know how when you're at school and your teacher sometimes leaves the room for a few minutes, but then when you start playing loudly or arguing with your friends, the teacher comes back and tells everyone to be quiet and behave? There's a big, powerful country called the United States, and they understand that these fights and violence are not good. So, the United States is saying that they would like the leaders from the far away land, where the sad things are happening, to make a team and come up with a plan on how to take care of the people who are getting hurt. Sometimes a soccer team needs a new coach to help the players work together, right? This is the same kind of thing; the leaders need help figuring out how to make people safe and happy again. When people work together, good things usually happen! The United States is hoping that if the leaders in that far away land work together, they can make a plan that will help everyone feel better and make the people safe and happy again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had a craving for oysters so my bf did some research on Yelp and saw this place. We are impressed! We luckily, dumb luck that is, came during happy hour. This was a great situation as many items are on special so we could try several dishes for a good price. We started off with the lobster bisque, this was my second time having it (first time was on the Fisherman's Wharf in SF). It was delicious with nice big chunks of lobster. Next we ordered a dozen oysters and they went so fast we barely realized how quickly we ate them. We figured someone must have stole some off our plate. They offered a variety of toppings for the oysters and all three were good. Next we moved on to the lobster Mac & Cheese. By itself it was a tad bland, but our waiter quickly told us about the house special hot sauce, this is a must!! We also had the beer steamed clams. The bread brought soaked up the broth perfectly. Finally, because I think my bf is trying to kill me via gluttony, we had the bread pudding. He said he would come back here for that alone. It was cinnamon goodness in a bowl. I have nothing but great things to say. The highlight was the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was quite attentive. He offered several good suggestions and had a great personality joking with us.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Van Cortlandt Park is located in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. The park covers more than 1,146 acres of land, making it the third-largest park in the city. It is bordered by Yonkers to the north, the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) and Kingsbridge to the east, Jerome Park Reservoir to the southeast, Broadway and Riverdale to the west, and the Mosholu Parkway to the south. The Grand Concourse, a wide boulevard, does pass through certain areas of the park but is mainly located on the eastern side of the park, running north to south. Van Cortlandt Park has a rich history dating back to the 17th century when it was first occupied by the native Lenape people and later by the Dutch settlers. It was named after the Van Cortlandt family, who owned the land during the colonial period. The park was officially established in 1888, after the land was acquired by the government. The park features various attractions, including sports fields, playgrounds, walking trails, horseback riding, and one of the oldest public golf courses in the United States, the Van Cortlandt Park Golf Course. In addition, the park is home to several historic sites, such as the Van Cortlandt House Museum (built in 1748), the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, and the Bronx's highest point, Vault Hill. Visitors to Van Cortlandt Park can enjoy a wide array of recreational activities, including baseball, soccer, cricket, cross-country running, tennis, and swimming in the public pool. Nature lovers can explore the park's extensive network of hiking trails, the 188-acre Van Cortlandt Lake, and the park's forests, which are home to a diverse range of plants and wildlife. The park is well-connected to various public transportation options, including subway lines 1 and 4, multiple bus routes, as well as the Metro-North Hudson Line, making it easily accessible to New York City residents and visitors alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: what type of car was christine in the movie?","completion":"Christine, the titular car in the 1983 movie based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, is a 1958 Plymouth Fury. This classic American car became popular due to the film's portrayal of it as a sentient, evil vehicle that possesses the ability to repair itself and exert control over its owner. The 1958 Plymouth Fury was developed by Plymouth, a division of the Chrysler Corporation, and belonged to the third generation of the Fury model line (1955-1958). It was a two-door hardtop and came with a range of engine options, including a 318 cu in (5.2L) V8, a 350 cu in (5.7L) V8, or a highly sought-after 361 cu in (5.9L) V8 with dual 4-barrel carburetors, known as the \\"Golden Commando\\" engine, which provided high performance for the time. The Fury was available in a unique color for that year called \\"Buckskin Beige,\\" featuring gold anodized aluminum inserts on the side panels, and the interior was also finished in tan and beige tones with gold trim accents. In the movie, Christine is portrayed as having unique powers, haunting her owner and causing destruction to those who seek to damage or harm her. Despite the Fury being available only in Buckskin Beige in real life, Christine was depicted in the film as a fiery red and white automobile. It is important to note that several 1957 and 1958 Plymouth Belvedere and Savoy models were also used as stunt and stand-in cars during the filming of the movie, since the real Fury was a rare and expensive model, and the production team was not able to procure enough for filming purposes. These models were modified to closely resemble the 1958 Plymouth Fury."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

To do this, we'll add 15*f to both sides: -25*f + 15*f - 20 = -15*f + 15*f Now, simplify: -10 * f - 20 = 0 Step 2: Now, let's try to isolate 'f' by getting rid of the -20. We'll add 20 to both sides: -10 * f - 20 + 20 = 0 + 20 Simplify: -10 * f = 20 Step 3: Lastly, we need to find the value of 'f'. Now, we'll divide both sides by -10: (-10 * f) / -10 = 20 / -10 Now, simplify: f = -2 So, f = -2 is the solution to our math problem!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose your answer: Is \\"Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Which dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language?\\" Available choices: 1). yes 2). no","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"Which dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language?\\" However, it would be beneficial to provide additional context and information to explain why and how this development occurred. The Tuscan dialect, which originated in the Tuscany region of Italy, is considered the most prestigious Italian dialect, primarily due to the works of key historical figures in Italian literature. These three poets are Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch), and Giovanni Boccaccio. Their influential works played a pivotal role in shaping the Italian language and elevating the status of the Tuscan dialect. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) was a prominent Italian poet who wrote the Divine Comedy ('La Divina Commedia'), an epic poem divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. This masterpiece is considered one of the greatest works of world literature and was written in the Tuscan dialect, which helped the dialect gain prestige and widespread prominence. Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374), better known as Petrarch, was another influential Italian poet who significantly contributed to the establishment of the Tuscan dialect. He is renowned for his collection of 366 poems called 'Canzoniere' (Songbook) that covers various themes such as love, virtue, and emotions. Petrarch's use of the Tuscan dialect in his poetry further solidified the dialect's status in Italian literature. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), the third significant poet of this period, wrote 'The Decameron,' a collection of 100 short tales encompassing various topics such as love, tragedy, and wit. Through his literary works in the Tuscan dialect, Boccaccio also contributed to its recognition and acceptance as a standard for the written Italian language. In conclusion, the Tuscan dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language due to the combined efforts of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio. Their groundbreaking literary works immortalized the Tuscan dialect, which eventually led to its adoption as the prestigious and standard written form of the Italian language."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seniors will receive their stimulus payments the same way they receive their Social Security funds. Tens of millions of Social Security recipients will see their bank accounts jump by 250 starting Thursday, when the government began sending out checks and transferring funds for a one-time boost coming from the stimulus bill passed in February. The payments are flowing to nearly 55 million seniors and retirees between now and June 4, with a huge batch of checks hitting the mail this week. \\"Approximately half of them will be out in the next day or two,\\" Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told CNN Thursday. The money will arrive in the same way that each person receives regular Social Security or Supplemental Security Income funds. If a person receives a Social Security check in the mail, the 250 stimulus payment will also appear in his or her mailbox. An increasing number of people use direct deposit, so many seniors and SSI recipients could see the 250 boost in their accounts immediately. Social Security and SSI recipients make up the largest groups to get the stimulus money, but it will also go out to railroad retirees and disabled veterans. Agencies serving those groups will release the funds separately. All told, the government estimates some 64 million Americans will receive the one-time stimulus checks this year, at a cost of 13 billion to the federal budget. This comes as the Obama administration continues a public relations push to show that the 787 billion stimulus act is warming up the economy. Astrue noted that these 250 payments are going out weeks before the deadline and are, by far, the largest single stimulus payment to individual Americans. \\"This is a point in time where some of the first big chunks of stimulus money is actually going into the economy,\\" Astrue said. Meanwhile, there is vigorous debate over how stimulus payments will be spent in tough times. Will the checks do anything for the overall economy? Astrue's agency has asked seniors to e-mail and tell what they plan to do with the 250. He admits that some have said they expect to save the money or pay off debts, but he insists that many responses listed hands-on spending. \\"We get people who say they'll buy paint, we get people who say they'll buy furniture,\\" he said. \\"Quite a few of our recipients say they'll buy clothes or school supplies for their grandkids.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The U.S. government began sending out 250 stimulus payments to nearly 55 million seniors, retirees, and struggling Social Security recipients starting Thursday.

The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, only to be killed himself by an unidentified creature.Dr. Robert Verne is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people.Dr. Verne's wife Maggie accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\".As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks Armand Assante and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a double-bit axe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw nearly at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident.While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon....

Here is a hypothesis: Long cables were tied around huge slabs of rock. Here are the options: Choices: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"If the premise is true, then it is indeed possible that the hypothesis is also true. Let us examine the premise and hypothesis in detail to understand if both statements are interconnected and whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the given premise. Premise: Long ropes were looped around enormous slabs of quarried rock. The premise states that there are long ropes. These ropes are used to form loops around enormous slabs of quarried rock. It means that the ropes are used to manage, move, or secure the large rocks that were mined from a quarry. Hypothesis: Long cables were tied around huge slabs of rock. The hypothesis proposes that long cables were used. These cables are tied around huge slabs of rock. Like the premise, it suggests that the cables were used to manage, move, or secure large rocks, but it does not specify the origin of the rocks (whether they are from a quarry or not). Now let's compare the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Ropes vs. Cables: In the premise, ropes are used, while in the hypothesis, cables are used. Ropes are generally made from fibers, while cables can be made from either metal or fibers. It is important to note that cables are usually stronger and more durable than ropes. However, both can serve a similar purpose in handling heavy loads. 2. Enormous vs. Huge: Both adjectives imply that the size of the rocks is large. Additionally, these words are subjective and could vary in interpretation. Therefore, we could consider both adjectives to describe similar-sized rocks. 3. Quarried vs. Not specified: The premise explicitly mentions that the rocks are quarried, while the hypothesis does not specify the origin of the rocks. It is possible that the rocks in the hypothesis come from a quarry, but it's not confirmed in the statement. Despite these differences, the premise's core idea coincides with the hypothesis‚Äîusing a long, flexible material to manage, move, or secure substantial slabs of rock. While the type of material used (rope or cable) and the origin of the rocks slightly differ, the purpose and context remain similar. Considering the similarities and connections between the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. While they are not identical statements, the truth of the premise supports the plausibility and allows the hypothesis's core idea to be true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next‚Ä¶ to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour‚Äôs drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn‚Äôt just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees ‚Äî little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona‚Äôs new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources ‚Äî Pellegrino Artusi‚Äôs 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice‚Äôs Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns.

Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today. However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. The term is also applied to non-human populations like ants and bees. - The Pasi are one of the untouchable communities ( or dalits ) who are now classified as a Scheduled Caste under modern India 's system of positive discrimination . As untouchables , they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna . They live in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh . - Social stratification is a society's categorization of people into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, social stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship or caste, or both. - The caste system in India is the paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste. It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and, modern India, especially the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. It is today the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists of two different concepts, \\"varna\\" and \\"jti\\", which may be regarded as different levels of analysis of this system. - Affirmative action (known as reservation in India and Nepal and positive discrimination in the UK; also known in a narrower context as employment equity in Canada and South Africa) is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances. The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. Some countries, such as India, use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group. In some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man whose men are not allowed to arm themselves? ? Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.

Use evidence from the fact that the moon reflects sunlight towards the Earth to answer this question: \\"What best describes the relationship with the moon, Earth, and the sun?\\"","completion":"To answer the question \\"What best describes the relationship with the moon, Earth, and the sun?\\" based on the fact that the moon reflects sunlight towards the Earth, let's think step-by-step: Step 1: Observe the evidence - The moon reflects sunlight towards Earth. Step 2: Reflect on the positions of the sun, moon, and Earth - In order for the moon to reflect sunlight towards Earth, it must be positioned between the sun and the Earth. - However, the moon orbits Earth, and these positions change constantly. Therefore, the moon is not always in the same position relative to the sun and Earth. Step 3: Consider the properties of the objects involved - The sun emits light, which is the source of the light that the moon reflects. - The moon does not emit light; it only reflects the sunlight that reaches it. - The Earth receives and is illuminated by the reflected sunlight from the moon. Step 4: Identify the relationship between the sun, moon, and Earth - The sun is the light source. - The moon serves as a reflective object which redirects sunlight towards Earth. - The Earth is the receiver of both direct sunlight and reflected sunlight from the moon. Based on these steps, the best description of the relationship between the moon, Earth, and the sun is: The sun, moon, and Earth have an interdependent relationship that involves sunlight emission, reflection, and reception. The sun emits light, the moon reflects this light towards Earth, and the Earth receives illumination from both direct sunlight and reflected sunlight from the moon. The positions of these celestial bodies in relation to one another change constantly due to the moon's orbit around Earth and the Earth's orbit around the sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Diese Pr√ºfungen decken sowohl theoretische als auch praktische Aspekte ab, um sicherzustellen, dass die jeweilige Person √ºber die erforderlichen Fachkenntnisse verf√ºgt, um in ihrem jeweiligen Bereich erfolgreich zu sein. Um eine solche Qualifikation zu erlangen, muss man in der Regel eine Berufsausbildung absolvieren, die normalerweise zwischen zwei und dreieinhalb Jahren dauert, abh√§ngig von der Art der Ausbildung und dem jeweiligen Beruf. Ausbildungen werden sowohl von staatlichen als auch von privaten Bildungseinrichtungen angeboten und erm√∂glichen es den Auszubildenden, die notwendigen Fertigkeiten und Kenntnisse in ihrer gew√§hlten Branche zu erlernen. Ein wichtiger Bestandteil der beruflichen Qualifikation und der Erreichung eines Handwerks- oder Gesellenbriefs ist die erfolgreiche Absolvierung von Pr√ºfungen in spezifischen theoretischen F√§chern. Diese Pr√ºfungen stellen sicher, dass die Auszubildenden nicht nur √ºber praktisches K√∂nnen und Fachwissen verf√ºgen, sondern auch die theoretischen Grundlagen ihres Berufs verstehen. Die Pr√ºfungen k√∂nnen schriftlich, m√ºndlich oder praktisch sein und behandeln je nach Berufszweig unterschiedliche Themengebiete. Daher besteht die grundlegende Anforderung f√ºr eine anerkannte berufliche Qualifikation oder einen Handwerks- oder Gesellenbrief in Deutschland in erster Linie aus der Absolvierung einer Ausbildung und dem Bestehen von Pr√ºfungen in spezifischen theoretischen F√§chern, die f√ºr den jeweiligen Beruf relevant sind. Diese Qualifikationen sind ein deutliches Zeichen f√ºr die Kompetenz und Fachkenntnisse der Person und werden von potenziellen Arbeitgebern und Kunden bei der Auswahl geeigneter Fachkr√§fte gesch√§tzt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's analyze the premise. The statement expresses concern and sympathy about a negative situation involving a nursing home. The speaker wonders if the people involved had checked into the nursing homes before putting their loved one in it, acknowledging that it might be difficult to get a spot in such facilities. However, this premise does not provide any concrete information about the exact procedure or the waiting period required for securing a spot in a nursing home. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. It states that people have to book years in advance for spots in nursing homes. While it is true that nursing homes can be in high demand and may have long waiting lists, this hypothesis simplifies the situation by making a blanket statement about all nursing homes. It is crucial to note that waiting times for nursing homes can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, reputation, quality of care, and availability of resources. Some nursing homes may have shorter waiting lists, while others may require booking much further in advance. In conclusion, although there might be some correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, the connection between them is not concrete enough to confirm that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. To establish such a conclusion, more data and information about the specific nursing home and the possible factors that influenced the decision-making process in this case would be needed. While it may be challenging to find appropriate nursing homes with available spots, the given premise and hypothesis do not conclusively prove that booking years in advance is a requirement for all nursing homes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception ‚Äî the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

(CNN) -- Bayern Munich look simply unstoppable and uncatchable in the Bundesliga as Eintracht Frankfurt were the latest team to be swept aside Sunday with a 5-0 rout re-opening a 13-point advantage at the top. It was Bayern's record 44th unbeaten game in the German championship and their third since returning from the midwinter break.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

(CNN) -- Relations between the Vatican and Ireland deteriorated sharply as the Holy See appeared to ignore a commission looking into complaints of physical and sexual abuse of children by Irish priests, according to U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. One cable from earlier this year says the Vatican was angered by the way the Murphy Commission -- which was looking into the how complaints of abuse had been handled by the Church and Irish government -- sidestepped normal diplomatic channels. The commission had written directly to the Vatican to seek information and requested a meeting with the Vatican's representative in Ireland.

Also, given the context of the paragraph, it would be the Irish opposition politicians who would have a vested interest in challenging or criticizing their government's interactions with the Vatican especially on an issue as sensitive as child abuse by clergy.

Here is an article: Tomorrow morning the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will mark the winter solstice by taking an unprecedented step to expand government's reach into the Internet by attempting to regulate its inner workings. In doing so, the agency will circumvent Congress and disregard a recent court ruling. How did the FCC get here? For years, proponents of so-called \\"net neutrality\\" have been calling for strong regulation of broadband \\"on-ramps\\" to the Internet, like those provided by your local cable or phone companies. Rules are needed, the argument goes, to ensure that the Internet remains open and free, and to discourage broadband providers from thwarting consumer demand. That sounds good if you say it fast. Nothing is broken that needs fixing, however. The Internet has been open and freedom-enhancing since it was spun off from a government research project in the early 1990s. Its nature as a diffuse and dynamic global network of networks defies top-down authority. Ample laws to protect consumers already exist. Furthermore, the Obama Justice Department and the European Commission both decided this year that net-neutrality regulation was unnecessary and might deter investment in next-generation Internet technology and infrastructure. Analysts and broadband companies of all sizes have told the FCC that new rules are likely to have the perverse effect of inhibiting capital investment, deterring innovation, raising operating costs, and ultimately increasing consumer prices. Others maintain that the new rules will kill jobs. By moving forward with Internet rules anyway, the FCC is not living up to its promise of being \\"data driven\\" in its pursuit of mandates‚Äîi.e., listening to the needs of the market. It wasn't long ago that bipartisan and international consensus centered on insulating the Internet from regulation. This policy was a bright hallmark of the Clinton administration, which oversaw the Internet's privatization. Over time, however, the call for more Internet regulation became imbedded into a 2008 presidential campaign promise by then-Sen. Barack Obama. So here we are. Last year, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski started to fulfill this promise by proposing rules using a legal theory from an earlier commission decision (from which I had dissented in 2008) that was under court review. So confident were they in their case, FCC lawyers told the federal court of appeals in Washington, D.C., that their theory gave the agency the authority to regulate broadband rates, even though Congress has never given the FCC the power to regulate the Internet. FCC leaders seemed caught off guard by the extent of the court's April 6 rebuke of the commission's regulatory overreach. In May, the FCC leadership floated the idea of deeming complex and dynamic Internet services equivalent to old-fashioned monopoly phone services, thereby triggering price-and-terms regulations that originated in the 1880s. The announcement produced what has become a rare event in Washington: A large, bipartisan majority of Congress agreeing on something. More than 300 members of Congress, including 86 Democrats, contacted the FCC to implore it to stop pursuing Internet regulation and to defer to Capitol Hill. Facing a powerful congressional backlash, the FCC temporarily changed tack and convened negotiations over the summer with a select group of industry representatives and proponents of Internet regulation. Curiously, the commission abruptly dissolved the talks after Google and Verizon, former Internet-policy rivals, announced their own side agreement for a legislative blueprint. Yes, the effort to reach consensus was derailed by . . . consensus. After a long August silence, it appeared that the FCC would defer to Congress after all. Agency officials began working with House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman on a draft bill codifying network management rules. No Republican members endorsed the measure. Later, proponents abandoned the congressional effort to regulate the Net. Still feeling quixotic pressure to fight an imaginary problem, the FCC leadership this fall pushed a small group of hand-picked industry players toward a \\"choice\\" between a bad option (broad regulation already struck down in April by the D.C. federal appeals court) or a worse option (phone monopoly-style regulation). Experiencing more coercion than consensus or compromise, a smaller industry group on Dec. 1 gave qualified support for the bad option. The FCC's action will spark a billable-hours bonanza as lawyers litigate the meaning of \\"reasonable\\" network management for years to come. How's that for regulatory certainty? To date, the FCC hasn't ruled out increasing its power further by using the phone monopoly laws, directly or indirectly regulating rates someday, or expanding its reach deeper into mobile broadband services. The most expansive regulatory regimes frequently started out modest and innocuous before incrementally growing into heavy-handed behemoths. On this winter solstice, we will witness jaw-dropping interventionist chutzpah as the FCC bypasses branches of our government in the dogged pursuit of needless and harmful regulation. The darkest day of the year may end up marking the beginning of a long winter's night for Internet freedom. Mr. McDowell is a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device The 45-year-old is among those being considered as a replacement for David Moyes after the Black Cats' relegation. \\"It just doesn't play a part to be honest,\\" he said before Saturday's game. \\"There's loads of speculation at this stage of the season.\\" McInnes would not be drawn on whether he would welcome an approach. \\"All my interest is on tomorrow's game and preparing the team,\\" he said. Aberdeen, who finished runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Scottish Premiership and lost to the Glasgow side in the League Cup, stand between Celtic and a fourth domestic treble. McInnes insisted that denying them their first such feat since 2001 was no extra incentive for him and his side. But he stated: \\"I think the level of player they have and the performances they've produced, anything other than a treble would be disappointing for them. \\"I think more Celtic teams should have won the treble in the last few years and, for whatever reason, they haven't.\\" \\"So, while we put ourselves under pressure to win, we've still had a very good season even if we lose tomorrow. \\"But we can have a brilliant season - a season to remember - and a special season by winning this tomorrow.\\" \\"The players are really relaxed and we are going into the game taking confidence from the performances we've had of late,\\" he said of a side that have won their last six games away from Pittodrie. \\"I feel we couldn't be more ready.\\" However, McInnes recognised the task ahead of his players if they are to end Celtic's season-long unbeaten domestic run. \\"We probably need a near-perfect performance from the majority,\\" he said.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the character who gives Wayne and Garth tickets to see Alice Cooper?, using the article: In Aurora, Illinois, rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, Wayne's World, from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for 10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted. Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records. While filming the revamped Wayne's World under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust. Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive.

Write a question about the article There I was outside a popular local bar with a friend on a Saturday night for a good conversation over the few drinks and our entry was denied . Well groomed , well dressed and with proper footwear yet our entry was denied and I was puzzled . when I asked them why and they slapped the door on my face and answered in two words \\" Only couples \\" .","completion":"Based on the provided information from the article, several questions can be asked. Here are a few: 1. What are some of the key societal norms and expectations that might lead to a bar's policy of only allowing couples to enter? This question asks the reader to think more deeply about the social context in which policies like \\"only couples\\" may arise. It invites reflection not only on bar policies, but also on broader social norms concerning public spaces and social interaction. It encourages the reader to consider how various societal expectations and conventions might lead to such rules, and to ask whether these rules are fair or unjust. 2. Can the 'Only couples' policy of the bar be viewed as discrimination and could it have legal implications in different jurisdictions? This question examines the potential legal implications of the bar's policy. Although the rights and freedoms of private establishments to enforce admission policies can vary widely by jurisdiction, the fact that the author and their friend were denied entry despite being well groomed and well dressed raises potential questions of discrimination. The question encourages the reader to consider how such policies might be viewed under different legal regimes, including whether they might be considered discriminatory or constitutionally problematic. 3. What effect could having a policy of only allowing couples to enter have on the atmosphere and clientele of a bar? This question invites the reader to think about how the \\"only couples\\" policy might affect the bar's atmosphere and clientele. It could lead to a deeper discussion on how such policies might influence the bar's demographic, whether it might limit diversity, and how it might impact the broader culture and social dynamics of the bar. It also opens up a discussion on whether such policies could potentially be used as a means to consciously shape and control a bar's clientele and atmosphere. 4. How can bars balance the need to create a specific atmosphere, for example, by having an 'Only couples' admission policy, with the need to avoid potentially discriminatory practices? This question takes a more pragmatic approach, examining how bars might balance the desire to create a particular atmosphere with the need to avoid practices that could potentially be seen as discriminatory. It suggests that the issue is not black-and-white, and encourages the reader to consider potential solutions or compromises that might allow bars to achieve their desired atmosphere while also respecting individual rights and freedoms. For example, it might lead to a discussion on potential alternative admission policies that could achieve similar results without excluding single individuals or non-couples. 5. What message does the 'Only couples' admission policy send to individuals, and how might it impact their perception of the bar or their desire to patronize it in the future? Finally, this question asks the reader to consider the policy from the perspective of individuals who are denied entry. It might lead to a discussion about how such experiences of rejection can impact individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards the bar, and may affect their decision to patronize the bar in the future. It might also invite reflections on the broader message that the policy sends about who is valued and welcomed in such spaces, and the impacts this may have on individuals' feelings of inclusivity and belonging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No","completion":"To determine the right answer, let's examine the two options more closely: 1). Yes - If we consider that humans can teach animals how to behave through training, discipline, and positive reinforcement, it's reasonable to say that humans can play a significant role in shaping animal behavior. However, this option does not account for the exercise aspect mentioned in the question. 2). No - If we focus on the fact that exercise is emphasized as a factor that can teach animals how to behave, then choosing \\"humans\\" as the sole answer might not be entirely accurate. Animals can also learn behavior through other means, such as socialization with other animals, instinct, and environmental factors. Given the context, the answer to the question \\"what can teach animals how to behave?\\" with an emphasis on exercise is: Option 2). No This is because exercise can indeed teach animals how to behave, but it is not solely dependent on humans.

Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions ‚Äì primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation ‚Äì have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.

There were frequent debates between the two countries on this matter. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country caused more deforestation? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the correlation between fossil fuel usage, deforestation, and carbon dioxide emissions can be drawn. However, with the given information about China using alternative fuels and Mongolia burning lots of fossil fuels, there is no direct evidence to conclude which country caused more deforestation. It is important to note that deforestation contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, as trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. When trees are cut down or burned, this stored carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. While Mongolia burning fossil fuels does lead to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, this information alone cannot definitively indicate its impact on deforestation. Similarly, China using alternative fuels for electricity generation implies a lower carbon dioxide emission from its energy sector, but it doesn't necessarily reflect its actions regarding deforestation. To accurately determine which country caused more deforestation, additional information on each country's forestry management practices, land-use changes, and other relevant factors would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: In addition to diversity sessions, many campuses train students on exactly what constitutes sexual consent as well as how to intervene when they see fellow students drinking excessively or poised to engage in nonconsensual sexual behavior. A bystander intervention presentation for arriving freshmen at Wesleyan University last Thursday ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe Speak We Stand‚Äù ‚Äî featured students acting out fictional episodes of campus sexual violence, harassment and problematic drinking, with examples of how to intervene. ‚ÄúEach of you has the power to bring to light sexual violence in our community,‚Äù one student told the group. Fresh on the minds of university officials are last year‚Äôs highly publicized episodes involving racist taunts at the University of Missouri ‚Äî which appear to have contributed to a precipitous decline in enrollment there this fall. ‚ÄúThat closes your doors,‚Äù said Archie Ervin, the vice president for institute diversity at Georgia Institute of Technology and president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. ‚ÄúIf you have sustained enrollment drops and disproportionately full-paying students such as out-of-state, the state legislature can‚Äôt make up the gap.‚Äù At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, officials have put together a diversity presentation as a pilot program this year for 1,000 freshmen ‚Äî whom some colleges refer to with the gender-neutral term first-year students. That program, expected to cost 150,000 to 200,000, follows incidents on campus last year. In one, a racist note was slipped under a black student‚Äôs door, prompting Patrick Sims, the university‚Äôs vice provost for diversity and climate, to post an emotional video on YouTube titled ‚ÄúEnough Is Enough.‚Äù Lori Berquam, the university‚Äôs dean of students, said in an interview that the sessions would try to address the fact that some students in Wisconsin, a predominantly white state, had little exposure to people of other races until they got to Madison. ‚ÄúIt would not be unheard-of for a student to join us from the state of Wisconsin having had zero people of color in their high school,‚Äù Dr. Berquam said. In August, the University of Wisconsin system, which includes the Madison flagship and 25 other campuses, said it would ask the State Legislature for 6 million in funding to improve what it called the ‚Äúuniversity experience‚Äù for students. The request includes money for Fluent, a program described as a systemwide cultural training for faculty and staff members and students. But that budget request has provoked controversy. ‚ÄúIf only the taxpayers and tuition-paying families had a safe space that might protect them from wasteful U.W. System spending on political correctness,‚Äù State Senator Stephen L. Nass, a Republican, said in a statement issued by his office, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote against the appropriation. Mr. Nass‚Äôs objection to spending money on diversity training reflects a rising resistance to what is considered campus political correctness. At some universities, alumni and students have objected to a variety of campus measures, including diversity training; ‚Äúsafe spaces,‚Äù places where students from marginalized groups can gather to discuss their experiences; and ‚Äútrigger warnings,‚Äù disclaimers about possibly upsetting material in lesson plans. Some graduates have curtailed donations, and students have suggested that diversity training smacks of some sort of Communist re-education program. The backlash was exemplified recently in a widely publicized letter sent to new freshmen at the University of Chicago by the dean of students, John Ellison. He warned that the university did not ‚Äúsupport so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.‚Äù Still, the push to respond to complaints about subtle cultural insensitivity, as well as more overt racist behavior, continues on campuses across the country. About 75 chief diversity officers have been hired by colleges and universities in the past 18 months, according to Dr. Ervin‚Äôs organization. Ms. Marlowe, a lawyer who most recently was diversity officer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was also recruited by two other colleges this year before settling at Clark, a manicured campus of about 3,000 students an hour west of Boston in this heavily working-class city. Her two-hour presentation on Aug. 27 aimed to help students identify microaggressions and to teach them how to intervene when they observe one. Microaggressions can be verbal, nonverbal or environmental, she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an environmental microaggression?‚Äù Ms. Marlowe asked the auditorium of about 525 new students. She gave an example. ‚ÄúOn your first day of class, you enter the chemistry building and all of the pictures on the wall are scientists who are white and male,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a female, or you just don‚Äôt identify as a white male, that space automatically shows that you‚Äôre not represented.‚Äù A nonverbal microaggression could be when a white woman clutches her purse as a black or Latino person approaches. Another subset of microaggression is known as the microinvalidation, which includes comments suggesting that race plays a minor role in life‚Äôs outcomes, like ‚ÄúEveryone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough.‚Äù For Clark students like Noelia Martinez, a Massachusetts resident who was born in Puerto Rico to Dominican parents, the session was an epiphany. ‚ÄúIt helped me understand what I‚Äôve been going through all of my life, basically,‚Äù she said, describing how she had endured stinging comments such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a really good student for a Hispanic.‚Äù But Ms. Martinez, a sophomore transfer student, also realized that she, too, was guilty of microaggressions, because she frequently uses the phrase ‚Äúyou guys,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis helped me see that I‚Äôm a microaggressor, too.‚Äù The presentation elicited a lively question-and-answer session, during which students asked about the N word, discrimination against white people and men, and the definition of ‚ÄúAsian.‚Äù Ms. Marlowe said she questioned the validity of the concept of reverse racism, arguing that racism is a system in which a dominant race benefits from the oppression of others. But some students appeared slightly confused. ‚ÄúWhen you use the term ‚Äòself-identify‚Äô as a white woman, are you saying that you can choose your race?‚Äù one white male student asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you an example,‚Äù Ms. Marlowe said. ‚ÄúI went to a conference. I was talking to this man. I thought he was black. I was talking about diversity and social justice.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Cuban,‚Äô‚Äù Ms. Marlowe told the crowd. ‚ÄúI assumed he was black because he was the same skin complexion as me, and the same type of hair.‚Äù But, Ms. Marlowe said, while it is sometimes difficult to identify a person‚Äôs racial or ethnic background based on appearance, she does not believe that gives license to people like Rachel A. Dolezal, the white woman who claimed to be African-American while working for the N.A.A.C.P. in Spokane, Wash. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say you‚Äôre black if you‚Äôre not, historically.‚Äù The student still seemed confused. ‚ÄúMaybe we can unpack it afterward,‚Äù Ms. Marlowe told the student. ‚ÄúYou want to come see me afterward?‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on September 7, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Campus 101: Learning How Not to Offend.

Answer:","completion":"Sir Ernest Shackleton, a notable British polar explorer, was born on February 15, 1874, in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland. In 1884, when Shackleton was just ten years old, his family moved to London, England. The decision to relocate was largely attributed to his father Henry's decision to study medicine, which eventually resulted in him becoming a qualified doctor. Shackleton remained in England for a significant portion of his life. It was in London that he completed his education, attending Dulwich College from 1887 to 1890. He then started his maritime career in 1890, initially working in the merchant navy and then progressively making a name for himself in polar exploration. Being a polar explorer, Shackleton spent substantial time away from traditional residences. He made several attempts to reach the South Pole, in a series of expeditions known collectively as the Nimrod Expedition (1907-1909), the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1917) and the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition (1921-1922). These polar journeys saw him spending extended periods in the harsh environs of Antarctica. Despite these arduous expeditions, Shackleton maintained links to England. For instance, during the preparatory and recovery periods of his journeys, he operated out of London. Some records point to specific residences, such as his 1908 residence at 14 Milnthorpe Road, Eastbourne, towards the end of Nimrod Expedition. Shackleton also bought a home in Sydenham, South-East London, where his wife Emily and their three children lived. However, due to his often extended absences and financial strains, Shackleton didn't spend much time there. These financial problems eventually forced Shackleton to sell the house. In his later years, Shackleton was planning another expedition to Antarctica but suffered a heart attack and died while his ship was moored in South Georgia, a British Overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean. He was buried there, following the wish of his wife, Emily, who felt it was appropriate for him to be laid to rest in the region he had dedicated so much of his life to exploring. Therefore, his final residence is, essentially, the Grytviken cemetery in South Georgia. In conclusion, though Sir Ernest Shackleton was born in Ireland and died in South Georgia, he spent most of his residential life in England, particularly in London. However, as an explorer, he also spent considerable time in the polar regions of Antarctica, which became an important part of his existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Olaf Stapledon wrote a book called First and Last Men, in which he looked millions of years ahead. He told of different men and of strange civilizations, broken up by long 'dark ages' in between. In his view, what is called the present time is no more than a moment in human history and we are just the First Men. In 2,000 million years from now there will be the Eighteenth or Last Men. However, most of our ideas about the future are really very short-sighted. Perhaps we can see some possibilities for the next fifty years. But the next hundred? The next thousand? The next million? That's much more difficult. When men and women lived by hunting 50,000 years ago, how could they even begin to picture modern life? Yet to men of 50,000 years from now, we may seem as primitive in our ideas as the Stone-Age hunters do to us. Perhaps they will spend their days goallocking to make new spundles, or struggling with their ballalators through the cribe. These words, which I have just made up, have to stand for things and ideas that we simply can't think of. So why bother even to try imagining life far in the future? Here are two reasons. First, unless we remember how short our own lives are compared with the whole human history, we are likely to think our own interests are much more important than they really are. If we make the earth a poor place to live on, because we are careless or greedy or quarrelsome, our grandchildren will not bother to think of excuses for us. Second, by trying to escape from present interests and imagine life far in the future, we may arrive at quite fresh ideas that we can use ourselves. For example, if we imagine that in the future men may give up farming, we can think of trying it now. So set your imagination free when you think about the future. Question: The text discusses men and women 50,000 years ago and 50,000 years from now in order to show that _ .

To do this, subtract 118 from both sides of the equation. -1478 - 118 = -84*k + 118 - 118 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. -1596 = -84*k Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by -84. k = (-1596) / (-84) Step 4: Simplify the expression to find the value of k. k ‚âà 19 So the solution to the equation -1478 = -84*k + 118 is k ‚âà 19."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea.\\" the correct answer? Choose from: [-] yes [-] no","completion":"No, your statement doesn't directly answer the question about who the Chinese premier was that called the actions of the US and the United Nations an act of aggression. The Chinese premier who referred to the actions of the US and the United Nations as an act of aggression was Zhou Enlai. Zhou was the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. As the main diplomat and policy maker of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhou played significant roles in Chinese history, including the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Korean War, and China‚Äôs opening to the West. The statement you've mentioned refers to President Harry S. Truman's response to North Korea's invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which marked the beginning of the Korean War. Truman's decision to intervene in Korea was due to his commitment to containment ‚Äì the Cold War strategy designed to resist the global spread of communism. He sent the Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan (the Republic of China), a move which was also aimed at preventing the conflict from escalating and spreading across the region. However, China viewed these actions as aggressive. When the US and its United Nations allies crossed the 38th parallel while chasing the retreating North Korean forces, Zhou Enlai interpreted it as potential threat against China. As a result, Chinese troops began entering North Korea in October 1950, marking a turning point in the Korean War. It's also worth noting that, at the time, China was not a member of the United Nations due to Cold War tensions, the question of recognizing the People's Republic of China's government, and the USA's support for Taiwan, which continued to hold China's seat at the UN. So, from the perspective of Chinese leaders, the UN and US actions were seen as unfair and aggressive, expressing interests that were contrary to Chinese sovereignty and regional security."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a new situation: Stephanie and Barb are two friends that belong to a sailing club. They are having a lunch at the cafe in the club and discussing their latest boat purchases. Stephanie mentions that her latest boat she has been using has cavitation. Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation. But I can use this background: Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar. What is an answer for this question: Would you be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Stephanie's boat or Barb's boat? The answer to this question is:","completion":"You would be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Barb's boat. The reason behind this lies in the fact that Stephanie's boat has cavitation, which is an undesirable occurrence in many cases, as mentioned in the background information provided. Cavitation can cause various issues, such as a significant amount of noise, damage to the boat's components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. When cavitation bubbles collapse, they create spots of high temperature, shock waves, and noise, all of which can lead to instability in the boat's performance and potentially affect the overall stability of the vessel. On the other hand, Barb's boat does not have any cavitation issues, which means that it is likely to provide a more stable and smooth ride. The absence of cavitation problems in Barb's boat suggests that there would be fewer vibrations, less noise, and a more efficient performance, which would contribute to a smoother and more stable experience onboard the boat. Considering the various challenges and issues that cavitation can cause for the boat's performance and stability, it is reasonable to conclude that you would be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Barb's boat compared to Stephanie's boat. This is because the absence of cavitation in Barb's boat would provide a smoother and more stable ride, reducing the chances of instability or sudden movements that could cause you to spill the soup."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ideally, you want at least 6 players per team for a competitive game. However, if you're playing with a group of friends, keep the same number of players on each side. You should have 2 rows of players, with the first row closest to the net and the back row closest to the rear boundary of the court. The player in the back right corner will serve the ball. You can rotate players around the court so that you will have a new server for each service game. If you are rotating players out, rotate clockwise -- looking at the net, the player closest to it on the right side would rotate out, allowing for many players to play. Toss a coin or form an agreement to find out who will begin the game. If you serve from in front of the line it will be a point for the other team. This is known as a foot fault. The ball has to go over the net (but it can touch), and it has to land within the court for the serve to be good. The player on the right-hand side at the back of the court serves. Each player will only receive one service attempt per serve rotation; you may serve as many times as you can get the ball in the other teams court. The ball is good even if it lands on a line. Thus the rally has begun! A typical play will be bump, set, spike -- but as long as it goes over within three hits, it's good. Technically, you can hit the ball with any part of your body so long as the ball does not come to a rest. Players may go over the lines, but the ball may not. If a player on your team hits it out of bounds, you may run to retrieve it -- successfully so if it doesn't touch the ground. This could be because of any one of the following: The ball hits the ground. This can cause the serving team to score 1 point for their team. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the serving team, then the other team has the opportunity to serve. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the receiving team, then the serving team can serve again. The point is awarded to the team that did not allow the ball to hit the ground. The ball goes out of bounds. The team that hits the ball out of bounds loses the point. Someone touches the net. If a player on one team touches the net, then the opposing team picks up a point. Someone's foot goes under the net. When this happens, the opposing team receives the point. Someone hits the ball 2 consecutive times. Players can't strike the ball twice in a row, unless a strike is in the block. A block does not count as a touch. A team hits the ball 4 or more times without sending it over. 3 is the maximum. Catching the ball without bumping it on the acceptance from play. Letting the recipient team receive the ball bump from anything besides their arms or hands can cause the serving team to pick up a point. Returning the ball without allowing the ball to cross over the top of the net will score one point for the serving team. The team that won the last point gets to serve the ball. If you're rotating, rotate now. If your team has the ball, it's common for the rows to back up a bit. The idea here is to get ready for an attack. If you don't have the ball, move forward. The idea instead here is to make the attack. Teams who produce an error or send the ball out-of-play will automatically send the ball over to the other team to serve. No extra score must be added to the \\"new\\" serving team. NO penalty may be given in any situation where the ball touches the net then goes over to the other side to be played. The ball continues to be live and playable (unless it comes back towards the recipient team on the volley). You can decide how many points you will allow for each game. For instance, you can start a new game when a team earns 15 points. Recent rules state that regulation games go to 25 points, with the third game (in a set of three) going to 15. Sometimes, games may take the form of ending with a certain time limit but this must be agreed upon - generally, this time limit will be eight minutes, but may be longer or shorter dependent on situation for the game. A standard match is three games long. Each team should switch sides at the start of a new game. The loosing team during each service should have the chance to serve in the next game of the match. A game must be won by two points. 25-26 will not cut it; it must be 25-27. Because of this, close games can go on much longer.","completion":"This article explains how to play a fun volleyball game with friends, including setting up teams, serving the ball, and scoring points by following certain rules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose a person has a bigger lung capacity happens, how will it affect \\"a persons breathing is more shallow\\". - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less Step 1: Understand the user's question The user is asking how bigger lung capacity will affect a person's shallow breathing. There are three possible answers: more, less, or no effect. Step 2: Analyze the information given - A person breathes in oxygen - Oxygen passes through bronchial tubes to lungs - Oxygen is moved into the bloodstream, circulates the body, and exchanges with carbon dioxide in cells - Bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Lungs expel carbon dioxide through nose and mouth Step 3: Consider bigger lung capacity A person with a larger lung capacity has more space in their lungs for air exchange. This means that their lungs can store more oxygen and release more carbon dioxide. Step 4: Determine the effect on shallow breathing Shallow breathing refers to taking smaller breaths and not using the full lung capacity. With a larger lung capacity, a person may have more efficient gas exchange, and it will take more time to fill the lungs with air. Thus, they may not need to take as deep breaths, which would result in shallower breathing. Step 5: Choose the correct answer Based on the analysis done above, having a bigger lung capacity would make a person's breathing more shallow. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s).

I tried to call you all night.","completion":"No, the word \\"call\\" is not used in the same way in these two sentences. In the English language, the word \\"call\\" can have multiple meanings and can be used as different parts of speech ‚Äì usually as a verb, but occasionally as a noun as well. Let's examine the usage of \\"call\\" in each sentence. 1. Call a football game. In this sentence, \\"call\\" is used as a verb. It has the meaning of officiating, overseeing, or narrating a football game ‚Äì which generally refers to the role of a referee, an announcer, or a commentator. For example, a referee would \\"call\\" a football game by enforcing the rules, observing the players' actions, and making decisions such as calling penalties, declaring fouls, or ruling a play out-of-bounds. An announcer or commentator would \\"call\\" a game by describing or analyzing the events, providing insights, and sharing information with the viewers or listeners. Therefore, in this context, \\"call\\" is not related to making a phone call or communication but rather to the act of overseeing or narrating an event. 2. I tried to call you all night. In this sentence, \\"call\\" is again used as a verb. However, its meaning is different from the first sentence. Here, \\"call\\" refers to the act of attempting to communicate through a phone call. The speaker is conveying that they tried to reach the other person via telephone throughout the night, but were unable to establish contact. This can imply that the person didn't answer the phone or that technical issues, such as poor network connection or a dead battery, prevented a successful phone call. In summary, the word \\"call\\" is used differently in these two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to officiating, overseeing, or narrating a football game, while in the second sentence, it means attempting to make a phone call in order to communicate with someone. The variety of meanings that the word \\"call\\" can have demonstrates the flexibility of the English language and highlights the importance of context in understanding the intended meaning of a word."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, despite slight differences in their structure and wording. Both sentences report an increase in revenue in the total external disk storage system market. Let's analyze the two sentences for further clarification. Sentence 1: In the total external disk storage system market, revenue increased 1.5 percent year over year in the third quarter, to 3.2 billion. Sentence 2: In the total external disk storage system market, McArthur said revenue increased 1.5 percent year-over-year in Q3 to 3.2 billion. The core information in both sentences is the same: the total external disk storage system market experienced a 1.5 percent increase in revenue year over year, and the total revenue in the third quarter (Q3) was 3.2 billion. The main difference between the sentences lies in the following details: 1. In the first sentence, year over year is written as separate words, while in the second sentence, it appears as a hyphenated compound word (year-over-year). However, both phrases express the same idea; they compare the revenue figures between the same quarters in consecutive years. 2. The second sentence includes a source, McArthur, who provided the information about the revenue increase. Apart from attributing the statement to a specific person, this addition does not change the overall meaning of the sentence. 3. The second sentence uses 'Q3' as an abbreviation for 'third quarter.' This change in phrasing also does not impact the overall meaning of the sentence. In conclusion, despite these minor variations in structure and wording, both sentences convey the same core meaning. Therefore, the answer is [ii] yes, the sentences have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution.

Write an article with the title: \\"IT Is From Venus, Non-IT Is From Mars\\" Article:","completion":"Title: IT Is From Venus, Non-IT Is From Mars Introduction From the dawn of time, humans have always been intrigued by the concept of differences ‚Äì whether it pertains to cultures, genders, or professions. Such distinctions have permeated our daily lives, sometimes quite subtly, creating an environment where certain stereotypes and misconceptions abound. In this spirit, it appears that the IT (Information Technology) sector and the non-IT industry seem to hail from two distinct planets ‚Äì much like Venus and Mars ‚Äì in terms of mindsets, cultures, and work styles. Given this backdrop, one might be tempted to ask ‚Äì why such a distinction? In the world of business and technology, each sector thrives by catering to unique goals, objectives, and standards. This article explores the reasons underlying the contrast between IT and non-IT industries, delving into the fundamental elements that set them apart. Mindset - Logic vs. Creativity Focusing on cognitive processes can shed light on the first layer of distinction. IT professionals are often governed by logic and analytical thinking. Their primary objectives revolve around creating and maintaining systems, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the seamless functioning of digital infrastructure. This requires a mindset that can effortlessly dissect complex issues, code, and design systems with a high degree of precision. On the other hand, the non-IT sector is typified by a more creative and visionary approach. Professions such as marketing, sales, and business development demand constant innovation, adaptability, and imaginative thinking. These individuals need to form strong interpersonal connections and think outside the box to achieve their goals. This does not, however, imply that IT professionals lack creative flair or problem-solving abilities. Rather, the primary distinction lies in the predominant mindset governing each domain. Culture - Geek Chic vs. Corporate Suave Evolving from the mindset, we arrive at the shared culture and workspace design. IT professionals tend to have more relaxed office environments, often designed to fuel creativity and provide a sense of comfort. Casual attire, flexible schedules, and open-space layouts exemplify a sector that embraces the \\"geek chic\\" culture, as opposed to a buttoned-down corporate aesthetic. The non-IT sector leans towards traditional corporate structures. Rigid scheduling, hierarchical workflows, and formal dress codes are persistently widespread in many non-IT industries. These aspects may be attributed to valuing time-tested policies, stability, and formality, which is not to say that every non-IT office is a corporate maze. The difference primarily lies in the emphasis on corporate norms and values. Work Styles - Process vs. Outcome Another crucial differentiator is the approach to work, which is closely linked to the aforementioned mindset factor. IT professionals thrive on building, modifying, and maintaining various technology frameworks. They inherently value process-oriented work and revel in the technical complexities of their tasks. On the contrary, non-IT professionals are results-driven and largely concerned with achieving targets or securing clients. They worry less about the intricacies of their field ‚Äì drawing greater satisfaction from the successful completion of tasks. The non-IT industry generally emphasizes quick wins, communication skills, and networking, with evolving targets and goals. Career Progression - Expertise vs. Generalization Last but not least, career progression offers yet another interesting angle to this dichotomy. IT professionals often progress by honing their skills and gaining expertise in various programming languages, software solutions, or systems management. The IT landscape places a high premium on in-depth knowledge and specialization, making continuous learning an essential aspect of an IT professional's career growth. In comparison, non-IT professionals might focus more on mastering skills to become effective leaders or managers while climbing the corporate ladder. Frequently, exposure to diverse industry experiences and problem-solving capabilities takes precedence over specialization. This trajectory ultimately carves a path for upper management or cross-sector exploration for career development. Conclusion The IT and non-IT realms might appear to inhabit entirely different planets, but in truth, they complement each other perfectly. In today's world, the integration of both sectors plays a pivotal role in enhancing technological advancements and achieving groundbreaking accomplishments. Cherishing these distinctions allows the right talent to thrive by aligning individuals' talents and passions with the appropriate environment, while fostering harmony in expectations and deliverables. After all, both Venus and Mars are known for their unique attributes and characteristics ‚Äì making them integral parts of the cosmic tapestry that is our vast hinterland."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this task, you are given two questions about a domain. Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \\"this national park\\", \\"this dog breed\\", and \\"this president\\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog.

REPORTING FROM BEIRUT ‚Äî The macabre and divisive drama about the decomposing remains of Moammar Kadafi appears to have come to a conclusion. Reports out of Libya indicate that Kadafi‚Äôs body was buried at dawn Tuesday in a secret location. Also reportedly buried were the remains of his son, Mutassim, and a former chief military aide, Abu Bakr Yunis. According to international news reports, the bodies were washed and an Islamic ceremony was conducted in front of relatives and local political and military authorities. [Updated, 7:48 a.m., Oct. 25: The burials came amid reports that another of Kadafi‚Äôs sons ‚Äî his one-time heir apparent, Seif Islam Kadafi ‚Äî was heading for the nation of Niger just south of Libya. Rissa ag Boula, an advisor to Niger's president and an elected official in the northern Niger town of Agadez, told Associated Press that he was in touch with ethnic Tuaregs who are helping guide the younger Kadafi through southern Libya to Niger. ‚ÄúIf he comes here, the government will accept him, but the government will also need to respect its international obligations,‚Äù Boula said, noting that Seif Islam is wanted by the International Criminal Court. Niger has said it will turn over members of Kadafi‚Äôs regime wanted by the court. The body of the senior Kadafi had been on public display inside a vegetable cold-storage locker in the coastal city of Misurata. The bodies of Mutassim and the leader‚Äôs former aide were later laid down next to Kadafi‚Äôs.] Images of the gruesome spectacle of Libyans posing alongside the gradually decomposing bodies were broadcast worldwide, drawing both morbid interest and revulsion. Many Libyans came from miles to view the remains and record the moment with photos and video of the corpse of the man who ruled Libya for more than four decades. Delaying the decision on the ultimate disposal of the corpses were reported disagreements between officials in Misurata and authorities of Libya‚Äôs transitional leadership in Tripoli, the capital. Libya‚Äôs new rulers didn‚Äôt want Kadafi's burial place to become a shrine for ex-supporters or a rallying point for potential pro-Kadafi insurgents. Kadafi‚Äôs family demanded that the remains be turned over to tribal kin in his hometown, Surt. All three were reported captured alive Thursday in Surt as the city was overrun by revolutionary fighters after weeks of intense battles. How the three died remains a matter of controversy. Libyan authorities in Tripoli say Kadafi likely died in crossfire during the heated last morning of the battle for Surt. Others say the evidence indicates Kadafi was executed with a bullet to the his head while he was a prisoner. Amateur video showed fighters manhandling and shouting at the bloodied, dazed Kadafi after his capture. Succumbing to international pressure, authorities have vowed to investigate the matter.

Good Charlotte is an American rock band from Waldorf, Maryland, that formed in 1996. Since 1998, the band's constant members have been vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: Good Charlotte (2000), The Young and the Hopeless (2002), The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004), Good Morning Revival (2007), Cardiology (2010) and Youth Authority (2016), as well as two compilations: Greatest Remixes (2008) and Greatest Hits (2010). Good Charlotte's third album, The Chronicles of Life and Death, was released by Epic Records in 2004. The album received mixed reactions from both the music press and Good Charlotte's fan base. The album sold 2.2 million copies. The album has been widely considered a departure from the band's previous two albums, mixing new elements such as lyrical topics into Good Charlotte's youthful sound. Singles released from the album include the two hits \\"Predictable\\" and \\"I Just Wanna Live\\", as well as \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\" and \\"We Believe\\". The only single from The Chronicles of Life and Death which managed to chart on the U.S. Hot 100 was the hit \\"I Just Wanna Live\\". All of the singles released from the album went top 30 in the UK, except for \\"We Believe\\". The band would then go on tour with Sum 41. In May 2005, after much speculation from fans, it was officially confirmed that Chris Wilson had left the band citing personal health reasons. Benji also told Kerrang! magazine that, for him, \\"Chris leaving the band was the worst part of 2005.\\" Chris then joined the pop/punk band The Summer Obsession until 2011. He currently plays drums for JMSN. On Good Charlotte's \\"Noise to the World\\" Tour, performing with Simple Plan and Relient K, the band recruited Dean Butterworth (who had previously played for Morrissey) as the band's temporary drummer. Later, in March 2007, Butterworth was confirmed as the band's permanent drummer. Benji Madden has claimed in interviews that he feels this record was not as successful as the previous record due to it being \\"too selfish.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: were there any singles?","completion":"Yes, there were singles.

Unfortunately for him, it was overshadowed by Reddit users who noticed his extensive and weird Reddit comment history, which included commenting on the death of Trayvon Martin. Bone, as GQ, Gizmodo and others have noted, tried to do an AMA a day ago but shut it down after users realized he was posting from his regular Reddit account‚Äîa.k.a., the account he has used to discuss such subjects as Jennifer Lawrence's right to privacy (‚ÄúMaybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it.‚Äù), his thoughts on pregnant women (‚Äúbeautiful human submarines‚Äù), and left this comment on a thread about Martin's fatal shooting in Florida at the hands of George Zimmerman: \\"It doesn't have to be a one or the other view here. From what I read about the case, the shooting of Trayvon Martin was justified, but from what I've learned of Zimmerman through statements, interview, and behavior he is a big ole shit bird. Bad guy legally kills kid in self defense. Sucks for everybody, including us due to the media fuckery.\\" Ugh, no. We're not the only ones who thought Bone would be the meme-making treasure that America needed at first: even Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted about \\"impeccably dressed\\" Bone this week, and Bone's unique combination of red sweater, aggressive mustache, and je ne sais quoi spawned a thousand think pieces. Ken \\"I mustache you a question\\" Bone, rose to his current status as king of memes Sunday night after he asked Clinton and Donald Trump a question about energy policy during the second debate. He went back on Reddit Thursday night to weigh in on less controversial matters, including Halloween costumes and whether he would announce how he plans to vote on Nov. 8. He also bragged about his \\"hot wife\\" (um...) got an invitation to smoke from Snoop Dogg himself, and pimped his new T-shirt campaign, which he will use in part to raise money for a St. Louis organization that helps the homeless. He curiously did not pimp his new relationship with Uber: Hello Reddit, I‚Äôm just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn‚Äôt see any of this coming, it‚Äôs been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I‚Äôm donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis. Reddit users were all over the most recent AMA, which started shortly after 7 p.m. Central Time, quickly identifying the 34-year-old Bone as \\"one of us, one of us...\\" for his quick-witted, instant-meme-generator replies. On the phenomenon of Sexy Ken Bone Halloween costumes, Bone replied that he was already a Sexy Ken Bone, thank you very much, and would more likely be going as \\"Obi Wan Kenboni\\" this year for Halloween: When asked whether he would run as an Independent in the next presidential election, Bone did not rule it out. However, \\"I don't even go to HOA meetings,\\" he wrote, so don't count on it. He said he is getting closer to deciding how to vote, but will not be announcing his vote because \\"I want you all to make up your own minds.\\" Bone also showed he wasn't above self-parody: Read on to learn more about meme-master Ken Bone, why he reps '60s-era St. Louis Cardinal Mike Shannon, and how he plans to hook his dad up with Snoop Dogg in L.A. ||||| Talk about building them up to knock them down. With his red sweater and earnest questions about energy policy at the Clinton/Trump town hall debate, Kenneth Bone quickly became a shorthand for all that is right about American democracy: mutual respect, caring about the issues, and the truly unifying power of a pun on the word ‚Äúbone.‚Äù While cable news networks quibbled about whether Clinton or Trump had won the debate, the internet knew who the true winner was, and everyone wanted to be in the #bonezone. Kenneth spent most of this week touring TV studios, packing in a schedule of public appearances of which any political commentator would be envious. He‚Äôs even slated to be one of the guests on a special live edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live! airing after the third presidential debate. Now that guest slot‚Äîand his reputation overall‚Äîmay be in jeopardy. The first rumblings of discontent came when Ken started cashing in on his newfound fame (as any of us would, really), posting an illegal ad for Uber‚Äôs luxury car service Uber Select on Twitter on Thursday (his following on the social-media network has skyrocketed from seven, two of which were his grandma, to 237,000 and climbing.) Ken‚Äôs de-beatification was made complete, however, after he was invited to host an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit. The wheels fell off the Bone-mobile as Ken unwisely used the same alias in the AMA that he had used to make a variety of decidedly less than wholesome remarks over the past few years. Here, for example, is Ken weighing in on the hacked nude Jennifer Lawrence pictures: ‚ÄúMaybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it.‚Äù That‚Äôs so gross that you can almost imagine Donald Trump saying it. Lawrence herself has said of the stolen images, ‚ÄúAnybody who looked at those pictures, you‚Äôre perpetuating a sexual offense. You should cower with shame.‚Äù It turns out that Bone was a regular participant in several NSFW forums, including one devoted to pregnant women in swimsuits, who he referred to as ‚Äúbeautiful human submarines.‚Äù Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Considering my less than glowing feelings about the \\"Immortal\\" show, I wanted to see if anything could be salvaged out of this rush of new MJ related entertainment. So in order to try to find some sort of balance and sense out of this experience, I tried this \\"Fan Fest\\". Was this truly \\"for the fans\\"? I'd have to say \\"Yes\\". It's striking how a bunch of inanimate objects and some livelier selections in music tracks could provide a much more entertaining event. This event focused on costumes, props and sets from his music videos and live performances, numerous awards, and a glittering wardrobe and attention to lavishness that would give even Liberace pause. Best of all, it was far more interactive than your average self-guided tour. The staff encouraged you to sit on some of the prop items, and were all too happy to take photos. The room was alive with Jackson's more pop and rock driven tunes, and while it played a slow song every once in awhile, it wasn't as heavy as the Cirque show was. This seemed more like a celebration than the actual \\"tribute\\". But how could one not be charmed by a recreation of his study with bookshelves and giant chess set, or the popcorn and ice cream trolleys from the Neverland estate, or a sampling of his arcade games, or the massively huge castle, or the Disney created dioramas that used to be in his movie theater? There were also the lavish interiors of his numerous cars, or the collection of fan art, or people playing the Wii version of \\"Michael Jackson: The Experience\\". Seriously, for someone who mourned the loss of his childhood, he had an amazing adulthood. Or at the very least, he had some REALLY cool things to play with. I was excited for the chance to play with the few items offered. But the Fan Fest wasn't as large as I would have hoped (I know, we're never really satisfied, are we?). After seeing online catalogs of an auction that would have taken place to sell his things years back, this almost felt like the tip of the iceberg of what could have been seen. Don't believe me? Here: http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/michael-jackson/catalog-list.html Some of these things were at the Fan Fest, but you just wanted to experience more. Regardless, I had fun at this Fest. To see these things up close, and in select cases, touch them, made for a very personal, informative, and entertaining tour. It makes me wish that they would just turn Hacienda Palomino (his old stomping grounds here) into a museum, because I think THAT would just be awesome....Available choices: --negative; --positive; I think the answer is","completion":"--positive The review seems to be positive because the person enjoyed the \\"Fan Fest\\" and found it entertaining and interactive. They also mentioned that it felt like a celebration, and they had fun. The negative aspects mentioned, such as wishing for a bigger event, are minor compared to the overall positive experience.

What is the answer for the question: What song has mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo? from the following article ? \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the title of R.E.M.'s fourth album?, using the article: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number..., what would be the answer ?

Catch one's breath.","completion":"No, the word \\"catch\\" does not have the same definition in these two sentences. In fact, the word \\"catch\\" demonstrates polysemy, which means it has multiple related meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, \\"I have to catch a train at 7 o'clock,\\" the word \\"catch\\" refers to getting on or boarding the train before it departs. In this context, \\"catch\\" is used to express the action of reaching a vehicle (like a train, bus, or plane) in time to travel with it from one place to another. It implies a sense of urgency because there is a specific departure time, and if you do not arrive in time, you will miss the opportunity to catch, board, or travel on that specific train. In the second sentence, \\"Catch one's breath,\\" the word \\"catch\\" is used idiomatically and has a different meaning. In this context, \\"catch\\" means regaining or recovering one's normal breathing rhythm after it has been disturbed or disrupted, usually due to exertion, stress, or surprise. When you \\"catch your breath,\\" you're essentially allowing your body to settle back into a comfortable, steady breathing rate after it has been altered. It also implies taking a brief pause or moment of respite to do so. In summary, although the word \\"catch\\" is present in both sentences, its meaning changes based on the context. In the first sentence, it refers to boarding a train in time for departure, while in the second, it signifies the action of regaining one's breath. These variations demonstrate the polysemy of the word \\"catch\\" in the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Recently a research was carried out in London,Birmingham and Leeds among teachers from different schools about student behavior management. The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers. Teachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? - A teacher risks losing the job if he/she manages student behavior improperly. - Teachers in England are not willing to manage student behaviors. - English laws forbid teachers punishing their students for their behaviors. - The laws to protect children in England are going to be changed.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Refried beans (Spanish: \\"frijoles refritos\\") is a dish of cooked and mashed beans and is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish. Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. Hypothesis: Refried beans are unhealthy.","completion":"The hypothesis that refried beans are unhealthy is not directly addressed in the provided paragraph. The paragraph discusses what refried beans are and where they are traditionally consumed, but it does not provide any information on the nutritional or health aspects of the dish. However, generally speaking, the healthiness of refried beans can vary widely depending on how they are prepared. Traditional refried beans are made by soaking and cooking pinto or black beans, then mashing and frying them in lard or oil, optionally with added ingredients like onions, garlic, and seasoning. Beans themselves are a good source of dietary fiber and protein and contain many essential vitamins and minerals like potassium, iron, and folate. They are low in fat and have been linked to various health benefits, such as improving digestion, reducing the risk of heart disease, managing diabetes, and aiding weight loss. The potentially \\"unhealthy\\" aspect of refried beans could come from the preparation method. Frying the beans in lard or a lot of oil can add a significant amount of saturated fat and calories to the meal. Similarly, adding a lot of salt or cheese can make the dish high in sodium and unnecessary fats. But it's also possible to make refried beans in a healthier way. For instance, using a minimal amount of healthier oils, like olive oil, and cutting back on added salts and high-fat ingredients can create a version that's lower in unhealthy fats and sodium, but still high in protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients. So, it's important to note that while some ways of making refried beans could potentially lead to a less healthy dish, others can result in a nutritious food that can be a healthy part of a balanced diet. Therefore, the categorization of all refried beans as unhealthy would be overly general and ultimately inaccurate. In conclusion, the health value of refried beans depends on the ingredients and preparation methods used. Therefore, it's not accurate to categorize it as simply healthy or unhealthy. More context would be needed as to how the refried beans are prepared to accurately assess their healthiness. Thus, with the information provided in the paragraph, we can't definitively say whether the hypothesis that refried beans are unhealthy is true or false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It suggests that a faulty battery is being considered as one of the primary reasons for the probe's failure. After crash-landing at high speed into the Utah desert, the probe sustained significant damage, and dirt and mud became lodged in the canister. Scientists have been working on removing these foreign materials, in order to better analyze the events leading to the crash and gain a clearer understanding of the underlying causes. Genesis, a space probe launched by NASA, had a mission to collect solar wind particles and return them to Earth for further analysis. The spacecraft was equipped with sample collectors in the form of wafers, composed of silicon, sapphire, gold, and diamond. The probe's purpose was to provide insights into solar processes and the formation of our solar system by studying these samples. The mission, unfortunately, ended with the crash-landing of the canister in the Utah desert. Due to the absence of a parachute deployment, Genesis smashed into the ground at an incredibly high speed, damaging the canister and causing it to become contaminated with debris from the crash site. This has complicated the work of scientists further, as they now have to delicately clean and extract the samples to minimize any impact from the debris on their analysis. Despite the crash, some valuable solar wind samples were retrieved from the damaged canister. These samples hold important information on the compositions of the solar wind and can help us to better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system, as well as the processes that govern the sun. In conclusion, the text is about the ongoing investigation into the crash-landing of the Genesis space probe, with a faulty battery being a major probable cause. The incident has impacted scientists' ability to study the collected solar wind samples, but work is being done to clean and extract the samples for analysis. This event emphasizes the importance of reliable technologies and systems in space exploration and the retrieval of vital information that enhances our understanding of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a title for this article: Philadelphia, PA ‚Äì Based on his performance in Sunday's STP Gas Booster 500, Jimmie Johnson certainly hasn't lost his touch at Martinsville Speedway. Johnson collected his eighth win at Martinsville, which is the oldest and shortest racetrack on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series schedule. He led 346 of 500 laps and beat Clint Bowyer to the finish line by 0.6 seconds to move up to third on the track's all-time race winners list. Richard Petty has the most victories there with 15, followed by Darrell Waltrip with 11. Johnson not only gave Hendrick Motorsports its 212th win in NASCAR's premier series but its 20th victory at Martinsville as well, which is now more than any other team there. Hendrick had been tied with Petty Enterprises for most wins with 19. Just how good has Johnson been at Martinsville throughout his career? Since his 35th-place finish in April 2002 -- his rookie season in Cup -- Johnson has placed no worse than 12th at this track. The five-time series champion also has led laps in 13 of the last 15 races there. Johnson won the pole position on Friday, which allowed him to select the first pit stall at this 0.525-mile, paperclip-shaped track. He also started on the pole and won there last October. If one thing is true about Martinsville, having that coveted pit stall can be very beneficial. \\"You make your day so much easier when you qualify up front, qualify on pole and get that first pit stall,\\" Johnson said. \\"(Teammate) Jeff (Gordon) sent me a funny text Friday. You're tough enough to beat when you qualify 15th, but on the pole, it's going to be impossible to beat you. I got a good laugh out of that.\\" Gordon, who has won at Martinsville seven times, finished third. \\"(Johnson) is so impressive here, but the thing that impresses me the most are those darn poles,\\" Gordon said. \\"He used to at least give us a shot when he would qualify like 15th. So when those guys get that number one pit stall, they're almost impossible to beat.\\" Johnson, Bowyer and Gordon were running in the top three just before the 12th and final caution set up an eight-lap shootout to the finish. The front end of Kurt Busch's car erupted into flames after he hit the wall, which forced the caution and briefly halted the race for cleanup efforts. Johnson was hoping the end of this race wouldn't be a repeat of last year's spring event at Martinsville. He was denied a victory in that race after he was involved in a crash with Bowyer and Gordon while all three drivers were battling for the lead following a restart in the closing laps. Ryan Newman benefited from the wreck by taking the lead and then picking up the win. \\"I was looking at the scoreboard wondering where Clint was,\\" Johnson said. \\"I expected him to roll right up there with how awesome he was (in Saturday's final practice). And Jeff on the longer run probably had the car to beat. Jeff has a really good line here on the long run, and he started catching me before the last caution, and I was thinking, 'Man, if this stays green, this could be a Jeff Gordon day.' But when the caution came out, I knew it was swinging back my direction, because we had such a good car on the short run.\\" All in all, it was a good day for team owner Rick Hendrick at Martinsville. Hendrick had three of his drivers in the top four, with Kasey Kahne taking the fourth spot. Dale Earnhardt Jr. had been running among the top 10 for most of the race until Danica Patrick made contact with Earnhardt and spun him out with 35 laps to go. Earnhardt entered this race with the points lead, but after his 24th-place run, he fell 12 points behind new leader Johnson. \\"We've been very fortunate to have some great drivers, and this track has been awful good to us,\\" Hendrick said. \\"I'm really proud of these guys and proud of the organization, because they all ran good. \\"(Dale Earnhardt) Junior had some trouble, but I was worried that we were going to end up like we did this race last year when that caution came out, because I didn't know who was going to take tires and who was going to stay out. But it played out, and it's been a great day for us.\\" Martinsville has been a special place for Hendrick. On April 29, 1984, Geoff Bodine gave Hendrick his first win as a car owner in Cup. The victory came in just the team's eighth start. Hendrick founded his racing organization in '84, which was then known as All- Star Racing. There were just five employees, including driver Bodine and crew chief Harry Hyde, at the time. Twenty-nine years ago, Hendrick would've never imagined he would be the all-time winning car owner at Martinsville. \\"I'm guessing Hendrick has got something figured out pretty good here,\\" Gordon said. \\"There's just certain tracks where the drivers that Hendrick has had over the past as well as now and just our race cars, it just really suits that.\\" The series returns to Martinsville the last weekend in October for the seventh race in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.","completion":"\\"Jimmie Johnson Secures Eighth Martinsville Victory and Boosts Hendrick Motorsports to Top Team Status\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford‚Äôs lab in England. Because Rutherford‚Äôs model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . Paragraph: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B?

Write a text based on this summary: roadside bombs in baghdad kill four us soldiers including one new arrival Text:","completion":"Title: Tragic Roadside Bombing in Baghdad Takes the Lives of Four US Soldiers, Including a New Arrival Date: [Insert Date] Location: Baghdad, Iraq In a harrowing incident earlier today, four US soldiers tragically lost their lives after a roadside bomb detonated in Baghdad, according to military officials. The attack, which took place in the heart of the Iraqi capital, targeted a military convoy. Among the fallen heroes was a young soldier who had just arrived at his first deployment in the region. The sudden loss of these brave soldiers underscores the prevailing dangers that military personnel face every day during their service, even as the security situation in Iraq continues to evolve. According to official reports, the US military convoy was en route to a local base when the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) was triggered. These devastating roadside bombs have been a persistent concern for coalition forces in Iraq. The explosion caused extensive damage to the vehicle, fatally wounding four soldiers and injuring several others. One of the fallen soldiers, a young man who was barely 19 years old, had arrived in Baghdad just days before the tragic incident. After enlisting in the military, he was eager to serve his country and contribute to ongoing efforts to stabilize the region. This bright-eyed youth, whose dreams were sadly cut short by the horrific attack, now leaves behind a grieving family and loved ones. The other three victims were seasoned soldiers who had spent several years serving their country on multiple deployments. Having forged strong bonds over time, they remained committed to their mission despite the ever-present danger. These dedicated individuals, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, exemplify the spirit of camaraderie and bravery that defines the US armed forces. In the aftermath of the incident, US military officials are working closely with Iraqi security forces to investigate the appalling attack and to identify those responsible for the cowardly act. As both nations join hands to destabilize terror outfits that continue to plague the region, they remain dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the people of Iraq. While this tragic event reminds us of the ongoing threats and risks faced by military personnel in conflict-ridden regions, it also highlights the unwavering commitment of US soldiers to serve and protect. The heartbreaking loss of these four brave individuals has undoubtedly left a profound void in the lives of their families, friends, and fellow soldiers. As we mourn the deaths of these courageous servicemen, we must remember to honor their sacrifice and pay tribute to their memories. Their selflessness and dedication to upholding the values of their country serve as an inspiration to all who are called upon to defend the freedoms that we hold dear. In these trying times, it is up to us to support the families of the fallen and do our part in ensuring that the legacy of these brave soldiers continues to be acknowledged and celebrated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
