Answer the following question: Q: Surface tension forces between moleculse cause the surface of liquid to contract to what? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces, reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all sides. Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Making Connections: Surface Tension Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon. The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they dent the surface as shown in Figure 11.28(a). Figure 11.28(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would sink. Choices: - typically surface area - Weak Surface area - strongest surface area - smallest surface area A: Answer:","completion":"smallest possible surface area"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father (Jude Law), a widowed, but kind clockmaker who also works at a museum. One day his father finds a broken automaton, a mechanical man designed to write with a pen, at the museum, and he and Hugo try to repair it, his father documenting the automaton in a notebook. When his father is killed by a fire at the museum, Hugo is forced to live with his resentful, alcoholic uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), and made to learn how to maintain the clocks at the railway station of Gare Montparnasse. When Claude goes missing for several days, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks, fearing that he would be sent away as an orphan by the vindictive Station Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) if Claude's absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine still requires a heart-shaped key that his father could not find.Hugo is caught when stealing from the toy store owner Georges (Ben Kingsley), who looks through his father's notebook and threatens to destroy it. Hugo encounters Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) who offers to help get the notebook back. Hugo learns Georges has forbidden Isabelle from going to the cinema, and introduces the medium to her as his father had done for him. As their friendship grows, he shows her the automaton, and is surprised when Isabelle reveals she wears the key as a necklace given to her by Georges. When started, the machine draws out a scene that Hugo recognizes from his father's description of the film A Trip to the Moon. Isabelle identifies the signature, that of a \\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s\\", as her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of more imaginative drawings of MÃ©liÃ¨s, but are caught by Georges, who banishes Hugo from his home.Hugo and Isabelle go to the Film Academy Library and find a book about the history of cinema that praises MÃ©liÃ¨s' contributions. They meet the book's author, RenÃ© Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), a film expert who is surprised to hear that MÃ©liÃ¨s may still be alive, as he had disappeared after World War I along with nearly all copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet him, RenÃ© agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges' home to show his copy of A Trip to the Moon, hoping it will invigorate Georges. On the scheduled night, Georges' wife Jeanne (Helen McCrory) tries to turn them away, but RenÃ© compliments Jeanne as Jeanne d'Alcy, an actress in many of MÃ©liÃ¨s' films, and she allows them to continue. As the film plays, Georges threatens to send them away, but Jeanne convinces him to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dream. Georges recounts that as a stage magician, he had been fascinated by motion pictures and used the medium to create imaginative works through his Star Film Company, but was forced into bankruptcy following the War, closing his studio and selling his films to be turned into raw materials. He laments that even an automaton he made that he donated to a museum was lost. Hugo recognizes this is the same automaton he has, and races to the station to retrieve it. He is caught by Gustave, who has learned that Claude's body was found some time ago, and threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Georges arrives and tells Gustave that he will now see to Hugo, adopting him as his son.Some time later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by RenÃ©.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. They noted that Lamb, 33, a handsome (and clean-shaven) military veteran, was straight from central casting and had no extensive political record to contradict stances so moderate and squishy that he could be mistaken, well, for a Republican. They said that Democrats would be hard-pressed to find many more Lambs with which to slaughter the G.O.P. in November. “When your message is simply I am for new leadership and cleaning up Washington, and you look like you just walked out of an Orvis catalog, you are going to connect with voters on both sides of the aisle,” wrote Salena Zito in The Washington Examiner late last week. “Lamb never slams Trump,” she observed. “He is not part of the resistance.” He further blunted Republicans’ favorite weapon against Democratic candidates for the House — they’re just would-be pawns of the dreaded Nancy Pelosi! — by running an ad that made clear that he would not support her as his party’s leader in that chamber. The point that Zito was correctly making was that many of the Democrats who will vie to unseat Republican incumbents in House races in November won’t be able to follow Lamb’s playbook. To get through their party’s primaries, they’ll have to stake out more progressive ground than he did, and adopt a more combative, fiery tone. That could undercut their chances of replicating his success. Indeed, Democrats’ euphoria over how he fared on Tuesday will give way to sharp internal tensions and sustained quarreling over which sorts of candidates — soft-spoken or bold, centrist or liberal, eclectic or pure — the party would be wisest, from a pragmatic standpoint, to promote. Many Democratic voters want someone less mild and muddled than Lamb. But if the Pennsylvania results put Democrats in an awkward position, they leave Republicans in an even worse place. What exactly is their best strategy for the midterms? Not all of their candidates will be leagues better than Saccone, who is no Roy Moore and is himself a military veteran. Sending President Trump into districts that supposedly smile on him isn’t looking like such a hot proposition. The mantra of “tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts” is obviously no panacea. And with each passing week — each passing day — the Trump administration’s turbulence intensifies and the scandals and scandal-ettes pile up. Yes, it’s a long way from now until November, and much about the national mood and the playing field can change. But in that yawning stretch of time, Trump can also render himself and his enablers even less attractive. I have faith. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

(Associated Press) MT. LEBANON, Pa. (AP) — A razor's edge separated Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone early Wednesday in their closely watched special election in Pennsylvania, where a surprisingly strong bid by first-time candidate Lamb severely tested Donald Trump's sway in a GOP stronghold. Lamb claimed victory before exuberant supporters after midnight, though many absentee ballots were still to be counted in the contest that has drawn national attention as a bellwether for the midterm elections in November when the Republican Party's House and Senate majorities are at risk. Lamb, a Marine veteran, told his crowd that voters had directed him to \\"do your job\\" in Washington. \\"Mission accepted,\\" he declared. Earlier, Saccone told his own supporters, \\"It's not over yet, we're going to fight all the way, all the way to the end, we'll never give up.\\" Regardless of the outcome — and a recount was possible — Lamb's showing in a district Trump won by 20 points in the presidential race was sure to stoke anxiety among Republicans nationwide and renewed enthusiasm among Democrats. After midnight with all precincts reporting, unofficial results had Lamb leading Republican state Rep. Saccone by fewer than 600 votes. More than 1,000 absentee ballots were still being tabulated as the count carried into Wednesday. In a race this close, either candidate's supporters can ask for a recount. However there are stiff requirements, including requiring three voters in the same precinct who can attest that error or fraud was committed. The stakes in the high-profile special election were more political than practical. The ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months, and the congressional district as currently shaped will likely vanish next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state's district maps. Yet President Trump and his chief allies invested tremendous time and resources in keeping the seat in Republican hands, mindful the contest could be used to measure Trump's lasting appeal among white, working-class voters and Democrats' anti-Trump fervor. The White House scrambled to rally voters behind Saccone, who cast himself as the president's \\"wingman,\\" but he struggled at times to connect with the blue-collar coalition that fueled Trump's victory little more than a year ago. Lamb, a 33-year old former federal prosecutor, asserted his independence from the Democratic Party, courted labor backing and focused on local issues. He studiously downplayed his opposition to the Republican president in the district where Trump's support has slipped by not plummeted. \\"This didn't have much to do with President Trump,\\" Lamb said Tuesday after casting his vote in suburban Pittsburgh. The president has campaigned in the district twice and sent several tweets on Saccone's behalf. Other recent visitors include the vice president, the president's eldest son, the president's daughter and the president's chief counselor. Outside groups aligned with Republicans poured more than 10 million of dollars into the contest. For Democrats, a win would reverberate nationwide, while even a narrow loss would be viewed as a sign of increased Democratic enthusiasm just as the midterm season begins. Lamb's excited supporters included his middle school football and basketball coach, Joe DelSardo, who recalled him as \\"a leader from the beginning.\\" The former coach described the district as having \\"a lot of suit-and-tie people and people who dig in the dirt.\\" Lamb, he said, \\"can talk to all of them, and that's why he can win.\\" Registered Republican Brett Gelb said he voted for Saccone, largely because the Republican candidate promised to support the president. \\"Saccone backs a lot of President Trump's plans for the country,\\" said Gelb, a 48-year-old fire technician who lives in Mt. Lebanon. He added, \\"I do think Trump is doing a good job. I think he needs backup.\\" Democrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on the district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years. It was open now only because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion. With polls showing a tight race for months, Saccone tried to persuade the GOP-leaning electorate that their choice was about \\"making America great again,\\" as the president repeatedly says. Saccone, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran turned state lawmaker and college instructor, enjoyed enthusiastic backing from the social conservatives who've anchored his state career. He's been perhaps at his most animated when emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights. Yet Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one-on-one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the Legislature should make voters' choice a no-brainer. Lamb, meanwhile, excited core Democrats and aimed for independents and moderate Republicans. \\"We worked really hard for it,\\" Lamb said after voting. National Republican groups filled airwaves and social media with depictions of the first-time candidate as little more than a lemming for Nancy Pelosi — the Democratic House leader that Republicans love to hate. Lamb answered the criticism by saying he wouldn't support Pelosi as floor leader, much less as speaker if the Democrats should retake control of the House. He also said he opposes major new gun restrictions — though he backs expanded background checks — and declared himself personally opposed to abortion, despite his support for its legality. Besides bruising the president, a Lamb defeat also could shake Republican self-assurance that their new tax law can shield them from other political woes. Lamb embraced Democratic orthodoxy on the new GOP tax law, hammering it as a giveaway to corporations at the future expense of Social Security, Medicare and the nation's fiscal security. And he embraces unions, highlighting Saccone's anti-labor record at the statehouse, which was a notable deviation from the retiring Murphy's status as a union-friendly Republican. The AFL-CIO counts 87,000 voters from union households — around a fifth of the electorate. ___ Peoples reported from New York. ___ Follow Barrow and Levy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarowAP and https://twitter.com/timelywriter . ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The recent special election in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Conor Lamb claimed victory by a razor-thin margin, has raised questions about the ideal strategy for both Democrats and Republicans leading up to the November midterms.

The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest.

While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life.

They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The art of public speaking began in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago. Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh. Great speaking ability is not something we're born with. Even Barack Obama works hard to perfect every speech. Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Options: A: Tips of great speeches B: The history of the speech C: Functions of the speech D: The language of the speech The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Functions of the speech This is the best title because the passage discusses various purposes and functions of speeches, such as persuading, inspiring, informing, paying tribute, and entertaining.

The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region).

It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

Steven and Linda Kologi, their 18-year-old daughter Brittany, and a 70-year-old family friend were gunned down in a Long Branch home shortly before midnight. The Kologis' 16-year-old son now stands accused of the killings. No motive has been revealed by authorities. Friends and neighbors were at a loss for answers Monday. \\"I just can't understand why,\\" said family friend Veronica Mass, 69, of Union Beach. \\"What happened? I just have no idea.\\" The teen, who faces a court hearing Tuesday on the charges, has not been named by authorities because he is a juvenile. Prosecutors said Monday they intended to seek that he be tried as an adult. He is being held at the Middlesex Youth Detention Facility. The 16-year-old's brother and grandfather were also inside the home, a multifamily house on the 600 block of Wall Street, but were able to escape unharmed, officials said. A 911 call reporting the shooting was made at 11:43 p.m. from inside the home. The teen's parents, Steven, 44, and Linda Kologi, 42, his sister Brittany Kologi, 18, and family friend, Mary Schulz, 70, of Ocean Township, were pronounced dead at the scene. Police said there was no history of violence at the home. The Century Arms semi-automatic rifle used in the killings was legally obtained and owned by a resident of the house. Mass said she was \\"stunned\\" when she heard the news of the shooting. Linda Kologi and Mass' daughter were close friends growing up together in Jersey City. \\"They were a close-knit family,\\" Mass said. \\"No drugs, no alcohol.\\" Mass said the 16-year-old was home-schooled since fourth or fifth grade because he had emotional problems. Other kids made fun of him, and he wasn't keeping up academically, she said, adding that a teacher told his mother he was learning disabled. \\"He improved dramatically after being home-schooled,\\" Mass said. \\"He learned to read, did his math. He got up to where he was supposed to be.\\" Socially she said he was \\"outgoing, very friendly. He would tell jokes.\\" Mass was also surprised to learn there was a gun in the home. \\"Big Steve, he did not like any guns in the house,\\" she said. \\"If they owned a gun, I had no knowledge of it.\\" Mass said Linda's sister and her husband live in another unit of the multifamily home, and were home when the shooting happened. Jalen Walls, a neighbor who went to high school with Brittany Kologi, also said her brother required special assistance and was cared for by his mother. \\"But he was fully functional and comprehended what we were saying,\\" said Walls, 18. Brittany Kologi was a freshman at Stockton University and was studying health sciences. \\"We are shocked and saddened by the reports of the death of freshman Brittany Kologi under such tragic circumstances,\\" the school said in a statement, adding that counseling is available for her friends and classmates at Stockton.

(CBSNewYork/AP) — New details were released Tuesday in a quadruple homicide in Long Branch. A 16-year-old New Jersey boy accused of fatally shooting his parents, sister and a family friend on New Year’s Eve. Monmouth County prosecutors say the teen would not be in the courtroom for the Family Court hearing on Tuesday. He was due to appear via video conference and the arraignment proceedings were to be closed to the public. The suspect’s name is being withheld because he is a minor. The teen faces four counts of murder and a weapons offense stemming from the shooting that occurred late Sunday night in Long Branch. Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the slayings but have said they may seek to move the case to adult court. On Tuesday, the court heard arguments from a local newspaper to make the case public even if the suspect was tried as a juvenile. A hearing planned for Wednesday, will determine if the boy will be held during the trial, and another hearing will determine if he will be tried as an adult. Investigators say the teen used a semi-automatic rifle, legally owned by a family member, to kill his parents, 44-year-old Steven Kologi and 42-year-old Linda Kologi, his 18-year-old sister Brittany and his grandfather’s girlfriend, 70-year-old Mary Schultz, who lived with the family. The shooting happened just minutes before midnight during a New Year’s Eve party at the family’s home on Wall Street in Long Branch. The teen’s grandfather and brother were not targeted and left the home unharmed. Authorities say the gun used in the killings was owned by one of the survivors. Authorities also said a third person — an acquaintance of one of the relatives — escaped the home after hearing shots fired. Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni described the shooting as an isolated domestic incident and said the teen was taken into custody without issue. “It’s a terribly tragic incident,” he said Monday. Friends and relatives are overcome by the enormous loss. “He always had your back no matter what. He always had your back,” said Steven Kologi’s childhood friend Ronnie Pacheco. “He loved his kids to death, he loved all his kids to death.” “Always smiling, not a violent kid or anything like that,” said family friend Joe Rios. “Why’d he do that to my cousin? Why would he kill his own mother? She was so good to that boy,” relative Walter Montelione said. Relatives describe Linda as a doting mother. Brittany was a freshman at Stockton University and they say Steven worked multiple jobs to support his family. “He loved his kids to death,” said Pacheco. Investigators say the teen did not have a criminal history. “He was a good kid, he was a little you know slow with learning disabilities but he knows right from wrong,” Montelione said. A family friend has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the family’s funeral expenses. Friends and family members were also planning a vigil in Long Branch at the Franklin Lake gazebo on Tuesday night. (© Copyright 2018 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done.

By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.

This is a long distance relationship. I’ve known this girl for awhile, 3 years, and about 6 months ago, we became romantically interested in one another. But she recently got out of a bad relationship, and said she wasn’t ready to jump into another one. Which I respected. She said she wanted to explore her options a little first as well. Which I also respected. About 3 months in, things were going great. She told me she was interested in this other girl who was nearby and it was the reason we technically weren’t dating. She also promised that’d she’d be all mine and soon. Well she started getting a little distant, talked to me less, which granted she’s busy with school and I am with work. But it became less and less and she seemed disinterested in even talking to me. I asked her if she still wanted me and she finally said that things were going really well for her and that girl and that she wanted to see where it went. It’s been 6 months. And this was getting frustrated, so I finally told her she needs to choose between the two of us, because I’ve had my heart played with for too long. I want a relationship, not these games.

In her annual report on the state of health, Dame Sally Davies said this was concerning, pointing out many people did not recognise they had a problem. Parents of overweight children were also failing to spot the signs too, she said. Dame Sally blamed the way weight was being portrayed by the media and clothes industry. Calculate your BMI \\"I have long been concerned that being underweight is often portrayed as the ideal weight, particularly in the fashion industry. \\"Yet I am increasingly concerned that society may be normalising being overweight. \\"Larger mannequins are being introduced into clothes shops and \\"size inflation\\" means that clothes with the same size label have become larger in recent decades. \\"And news stories about weight often feature pictures of severely obese people, which are unrepresentative of the majority of overweight people.\\" Dame Sally also reiterated her belief that a sugar tax may be necessary to combat obesity. At the start of March she told the Health Select Committee it may be needed, although she hoped not. This caused some controversy as the government's approach has been characterised by working with industry to get them to make food and drink products healthier. In her report she says this should continue, but if it fails to deliver a tax should be \\"considered\\". She said children and adults of all ages are consuming too much sugar. Nearly two thirds of adults and a third of children are overweight or obese - classed as a body mass index of above 25. This is about double the numbers in the early 1990s. But research shows that half of men, a third of women and over three quarters of parents do not recognise weight problems. Professor Kevin Fenton, of Public Health England, said he agreed with Dame Sally's comments. \\"We share her concerns. Overweight and obesity costs the NHS over Â£5bn each year and is entirely preventable.\\" But Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said he would have liked Dame Sally to take a tougher approach to sugar. \\"The report lets the food and beverage industries off the hook. It gives industry no deadline by which to show improvement with the likely result that her words will be quite ignored.

Article:The Paisley side need one point from their final game against Hibernian on Saturday to achieve safety. St Mirren's form since the turn of the year has seen them climb off the bottom of the table, and Ross is hopeful he can retain the majority of his squad. \\"I believe [this] group would challenge at the right end of the table, where the club should be,\\" Ross said. \\"When you look back over the last 20 games, we would be a point off second - that is evidence to suggest that they would [challenge for the Championship title].\\" Ross succeeded Alex Rae as manager in October last year, with St Mirren two points adrift of Dumbarton at the bottom of the table and yet to register a win in the league. It was December before they won their first Championship match of the season, but later that month they were still nine points behind second bottom Dunfermline. Following a busy January transfer window - with 10 players arriving and 10 players departing - Ross began to turn St Mirren's fortunes around and based on the last eight games, they are the form side in the Championship, sitting two points clear of Raith Rovers who are in the relegation play-off position. \\"Again the summer will be a testing period for us in terms of retaining players. Because there are a number of young players, their performance levels will mean they attract attention from other clubs and bigger clubs,\\" Ross said. \\"My ambition is to retain as much of the squad as I possibly can. I don't think I have to do an awful lot to it. \\"I don't really want to do what I did in January, I don't want to have to make as many changes as I did.

Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","completion":"No. The questions \\"How harmful could tomatoes be for dogs?\\" and \\"Is butter harmful to dogs?\\" are not the same. They are asking about the potential harmful effects of two different substances -- tomatoes and butter -- on dogs. To provide a comprehensive explanation: Firstly, regarding tomatoes, it is important to note that they belong to the nightshade family of vegetables, which contain substances called solanines that can be toxic to dogs. Green, unripe tomatoes, the plant itself, and especially the leaves and stems contain higher levels of solanine and could be harmful to dogs. Some of the signs of tomato poisoning in dogs can include gastrointestinal upset like diarrhea and vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, an abnormal heart rate, and in severe cases, even seizures. Also, the ingestion of a large amount of tomatoes could lead to solanine toxicity in dogs which could be fatal if not treated promptly. However, ripe tomatoes are usually safe for dogs in small amounts because they have lower solanine levels. But it would still be prudent to keep tomatoes out of your pet's reach, especially small dogs who could easily ingest a considerable amount relative to their body weight. Secondly, addressing the question \\"Is butter harmful to dogs?\\", butter is not inherently toxic to dogs, but it can still pose significant health risks if consumed in large amounts. Butter is high in fat, and excessive amounts can lead to obesity and related health problems such as pancreatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that can occur when a dog consumes fatty foods like butter. Signs can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, and diarrhea. Moreover, butter can also contribute to increased cholesterol levels, potentially harming a dog's cardiovascular health over time. Depending on the individual dog and the amount consumed, butter could also cause gastrointestinal upset resulting in vomiting or diarrhea. For these reasons, it's generally best to avoid giving your dog butter, except in very small amounts. Though these questions pertain to the same general topic (foods that could be harmful to dogs), they deal with different specific foods and thereby involve different considerations. Therefore, the answer is no, these questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"- indirectly impacting a step of the process When a person is very run down, it implies that they are physically exhausted or in a state of weakened immunity. This doesn't directly interfere with the process of viral multiplication or the steps of the virus in the host body, but it can indirectly influence the process. Specifically, it could impact how quickly and efficiently the host body can combat the virus. A run-down or weakened immune system might not be as effective in its initial response to the virus. This could potentially allow the virus to replicate and spread more easily initially. On the other hand, a weakened host could potentially translate to a less robust cellular environment for the virus to multiply - possibly slowing the spread or reducing the total viral load. However, these are indirect impacts. They don't change the mechanism of how the virus enters a cell, uses it like a factory to produce new copies, and leaves to infect other cells.

In 1984, Ray Parker Jr. was signed by the producers of Ghostbusters to develop the film's title song. Later that year, Huey Lewis and the News sued Parker, citing the similarities between the \\"Ghostbusters\\" song and their earlier hit \\"I Want a New Drug.\\" According to Huey Lewis and the News, this was especially damaging to them since \\"Ghostbusters\\" was so popular, rising to number one on the charts for three weeks. The dispute was ultimately settled out of court. Lewis has stated that his experiences with the producers of Ghostbusters were indirectly responsible for getting involved in the 1985 movie Back to the Future. In the 2001 Behind the Music special, Huey Lewis stated: \\"The offensive part was not so much that Ray Parker Jr. had ripped this song off, it was kind of symbolic of an industry that wants something - they wanted our wave, and they wanted to buy it. ... [I]t's not for sale. ... In the end, I suppose they were right. I suppose it was for sale, because, basically, they bought it.\\" As a result of this statement, Parker filed a suit against Lewis, claiming he violated the settlement's confidentiality agreement and sought an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorney's fees. An issue of Premiere magazine would later feature an anniversary article about the movie Ghostbusters. In that article, the filmmakers at Columbia Pictures admit to using the song \\"I Want a New Drug\\" as temporary background music in many scenes. They then said that they had made an offer to Huey Lewis and the News to write the main theme, but the band declined. In a 2001 Behind the Music special, Lewis said that the band declined the filmmakers' offer because the band had a prior contractual obligation to do a long concert tour to promote the hugely successful Sports album, which had just been released at the time, and didn't have time to write a main theme for a movie.

Gabe wanted to bark tan his leather jacket for winter, so he bought the bark and ground it up into a powder. The","completion":"next step was to create a solution that would permeate the leather and preserve it from the elements. Step 1: Preparing the solution Gabe had to mix the ground bark powder with water in a container large enough to submerge his jacket. He considered the ratio of bark powder to water, which was roughly 1:5, so he added 5 litres of water for every 1 litre of bark powder he used. Gabe stirred the mixture well and let it sit for several hours to ensure the tannins were properly extracted from the bark. Step 2: Pre-treating the leather Before submerging the jacket in the solution, Gabe needed to clean it thoroughly to ensure proper penetration of the tannins. He used a mild soap and water to gently scrub the surface of the jacket, removing any dirt or oils. After rinsing it and allowing it to dry, Gabe was ready to move on to the next step. Step 3: Submerging the jacket and agitating Gabe placed his clean and dry jacket in the prepared bark tan solution, ensuring it was fully submerged. He weighed the jacket down with a heavy object to prevent it from floating up. Over the course of a week, Gabe agitated the mixture once a day to promote even distribution of tannins throughout the leather. He kept a close watch on the solution's color and concentration, adding more bark powder if necessary. Step 4: Monitoring the tanning process As the tanning process continued, Gabe frequently checked the jacket for any signs of improper tanning, such as uneven colors or stiff spots. He also looked for any warping or shrinking, adjusting the jacket's position in the solution to achieve the desired result. Step 5: Rinsing and oiling the leather After a week or when Gabe was satisfied with the tanning, he removed the jacket from the solution and rinsed it thoroughly with fresh water. Once the jacket was properly rinsed, Gabe patted it down with a clean towel to remove excess water and allowed it to air dry. Finally, he applied a light coat of leather conditioner to replenish the oils in the leather, keeping it supple and well-protected. With these steps complete, Gabe's leather jacket was now bark tanned and ready for winter. The process had not only preserved the jacket but also added a beautiful, rich color that would increase its aesthetic appeal and durability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: As cyber attacks swell, a move toward improved industry collaboration At the First Conference for computer security in Boston’s Park Plaza Hotel last June, Andre Ludwig listened as Holly Stewart, a product manager for Microsoft’s Malware Protection Center, lectured to a crowd of cyber professionals about a new program that would unite organizations against the growing wave of malware that infects computers across the globe. The Coordinated Malware Eradication program, or CME for short, calls for organizations to pool their resources—from tools to strategies—to fight the onslaught, she explained. Instead of beating malware back when it flares up, a coordinated response can eradicate it altogether. And that’s when Ludwig, a senior technical director at the data analytics company Novetta, had an idea. “We had just started working on some instrumentation against HiKit malware,” he says. “That requires a massive amount of reverse engineering and intelligence. My first thought was, ‘Oh, I’ve got something for you.’” Ludwig cornered Stewart after the presentation and the pair chatted about knocking heads together. In hindsight, the benefits seemed obvious. At a time when Moscow has shown a willingness to wage digital war and Chinese espionage is considered an economic strategy, the U.S. cyber security industry is moving toward more cooperation. In September, at FireEye’s MIRcon 2014 conference in Washington, D.C., Ret. Gen. Keith Alexander implored a swarm of industry veterans—from Microsoft MSFT security experts to the Belgian police’s cyber division—to abolish cyber crime entirely by banding together with each other and the federal government. Distrust of the National Security Agency aside, the sentiment resonates: If gangsters, businesses, and hostile states can team up, why can’t we? In October, Novetta and others announced the beginning stage of Operation SMN, a collaborative battle against the HiKit malware family, a favorite of well-funded and sophisticated hacking groups. Ten days later, the coalition released a report on the effects: 43,000 separate installations of tools related to Axiom, a prominent cyber espionage group allegedly sponsored by the Chinese state, were removed from machines covered by Operation SMN; 180 of those were examples of HiKit. “We’re really pleased with how this played out,” Novetta CEO Peter LaMontagne says. “Since the release, we’ve had significant success in degrading the capabilities of the malware, and the actors relying on it.” Operation SMN marks the first time that computer security players such as Microsoft, Symantec, FireEye FEYE , and Cisco CSCO are bonding without using federal or international law enforcement agencies as glue. In July Symantec, Microsoft, and other firms partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency to take down Operation Zeus and Cryptolocker, both operations committed to criminal financial fraud. In May several firms worked with the FBI and Europol to arrest dozens of users of Blackshades, a remote-access Trojan virus sold to entry-level hackers in online black markets. Groups like Axiom, also known as Hidden Lynx, operate with what LaMontagne calls “extremely impressive” capabilities and resources, focusing on items in China’s stated five-year agenda. In 2012, the group targeted a tech hardware manufacturer contracted with the U.S. government. Unable to breach the security system, which was provided by the Waltham, Mass. security firm Bit9, Hidden Lynx instead broke into Bit9 itself to steal signing certificates and place malicious binaries onto the company’s servers. Operation SMN takes a page from the enemy’s playbook: sharing is caring. Groups like Hidden Lynx operate with massive synergy, says Eric Chien, a senior technical director at Symantec SYMC . Industry is moving to operate the same way, uniting technical experts by a love for problem-solving. “This didn’t come from the top-down, executive level,” LaMontagne says. “This was a personal interaction between really smart, really talented people in each organization who wanted to help each other out with their respective problems. We wanted to get back to that informal, hackathon-style interaction and the open-source ethos that goes with it.” And perhaps make fighting malware a far less slow and irritating process. “This is a prototype for a new methodology that shifts away from just observe and report,” Ludwig says. “This is collaboration for a more proactive approach of observe, analyze, distribute, then report. It’s a shift in the way we can solve problems.” Summary:","completion":"The US cybersecurity industry is moving towards increased cooperation. Novetta, Microsoft, Symantec, FireEye, and Cisco have joined forces for Operation SMN, marking the first time that computer security players are collaborating without using federal or international law enforcement agencies as intermediaries. The operation aims to combat the HiKit malware family, and within ten days, the coalition reported 43,000 instances of tools related to a Chinese state-backed hacking group known as Axiom being removed from various machines. The collaboration is expected to be a shift in the approach to problem-solving related to coordinating malware remediation."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Pay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long is the target of an ongoing Department of Homeland Security inspector general investigation into whether he misused government vehicles during his commutes to North Carolina from Washington, according to three people familiar with the matter, including current and former administration officials. The actions by Long, the U.S. government’s lead disaster official as the country braces for Hurricane Florence, have been called into question by the inspector general over whether taxpayers have inappropriately footed the bill for his travel, an issue that has tripped up a number of current and former top Trump administration officials. Story Continued Below Long’s travel habits triggered a clash between him and his boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, in recent weeks, clouding their relationship just as senior aides close to President Donald Trump prepared for hurricane season — a task that’s attracted extra scrutiny in the wake of the disaster that befell Puerto Rico in the aftermath of last year’s Hurricane Maria.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. The IG is investigating whether Long misused government resources and personnel on trips back home to Hickory, North Carolina, on the weekends, said two of the officials. The IG’s interest was drawn after one of the vehicles — a black Suburban — was involved in an accident, according to one of the officials. Long’s routine absences from the office due to frequent six-hour drives between North Carolina and Washington also drew Nielsen’s attention, this person said. Nielsen had raised the issue of Long’s in-office schedule with him in recent months, this person added. At a meeting in late August, Nielsen confronted Long about his travel, though people familiar with the meeting gave conflicting accounts about whether she took the step of asking him to step down over the issue. One of the officials said Nielsen asked Long to consider resigning, though he declined to do so and remains in his role. The program to support the FEMA administrator “was never intended for this purpose,” said the official. Long did not respond to requests for comment from POLITICO but addressed the IG investigation at a FEMA briefing on Thursday morning, saying his office was working closely with the inspector general’s office “to make improvements to make sure we are running programs and policies according to regulation.” “Bottom line is, we’ll continue to fully cooperate with any investigation that goes on and own up to any mistakes and push forward and keep going,” Long said. “I would never intentionally run a program incorrectly,“ he added. “Doing something unethical is not part of my DNA, and it is not part of my track record in my whole entire career. We will work with the OIG.” Jessica Nalepa, FEMA’s director of external affairs, said questions about specific IG investigations should be directed to DHS’ IG office and that FEMA fully cooperates with all investigations conducted by the IG. The DHS IG’s office and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. “All questions about any potential investigation by the Office of the Inspector General should be directed to the IG. At this time, we are fully focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Florence and the storms in the Pacific,” said DHS press secretary Tyler Houlton. “The secretary is confident in the leadership at FEMA and their proven disaster management ability.” Long started using a staff driver to get him home to North Carolina at the beginning of his tenure at FEMA last year. On the weekends Long spent in North Carolina, aides were put up in a hotel at taxpayer expense, according to one of the current officials. DHS employees must be authorized to access government vehicles for personal use, including travel to a residence outside Washington, according to one of the officials. But a former DHS official said Long, as administrator, is entitled to have a contingency aide accompany him so he can have secure communications in case of a national emergency. The former official added that Long “never asked for it and believed access to secure communications to be part of a presidential directive.” FEMA recently scaled back the use of the contingency team for cost-saving purposes, and Long now drives himself or flies to North Carolina. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, who served under President Barack Obama, said he could remember using government cars for commuting purposes only in seven instances during the eight years he held the job. In those emergency or extreme cases, Fugate said, it was deemed appropriate for a FEMA aide to brief him face-to-face as a driver took him from his home in Gainesville, Florida, to the Jacksonville airport for outbound flights to Washington, where his presence was required. Long previously worked at an emergency management consulting firm and also served as director of Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency. The Trump administration has come under intense criticism for its response to the damage Hurricane Maria did to Puerto Rico. Almost 3,000 people died in the natural disaster, many more than the earlier official tally of 64 people. Trump said this week that his government’s response to the disaster in Puerto Rico “was an incredible, unsung success.” Marc Caputo and Rebecca Morin contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the government's disaster relief agency says he has no intention of stepping aside, especially during Florence, despite being under investigation by a federal watchdog. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long says, \\"I'm here to serve my country every day. That's all I do. And when it's over, whenever it ends, I'm ready to go back home, love my family.\\" Long says Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen (KEER'-sten) Nielsen \\"has never asked me to resign\\" from FEMA. He says the two have a \\"very functional and professional relationship.\\" On Thursday, Long said he never intentionally misused federal vehicles after news broke that DHS' inspector general was investigating him.

Long spoke Sunday on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" and CBS' \\"Face the Nation.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Brock Long, who is in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is being investigated for possibly misusing government cars.

Here are possible answers to this question: - make love - get married - gone to jail - have children - learning I believe the correct choice is \\"get married\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"\\"Get married\\" is the most fitting answer among the given options because it signifies the beginning of a lifelong partnership and commitment to living life with another person. Marriage is a formal union that allows the couple to start building a future together, making joint decisions, and truly sharing their lives. While the other options may also involve living life with someone else, they do not capture the essence of forming a partnership and sharing a life together in the same way that marriage does. For example: - Making love: While making love can certainly bring people closer, it does not necessarily imply a decision to live life together or a long-term commitment. - Going to jail: Going to jail and spending time with cellmates does involve living with someone else, but it is an involuntary situation and not comparable to a loving partnership. - Having children: Having children indeed creates a bond with another person for life, but it does not guarantee that the child's parents will live life together or be in a committed relationship. - Learning: Learning can be done with others in various contexts, such as in a school or a job, but it does not inherently involve living life together or forming a partnership. Thus, \\"get married\\" is the correct choice when considering how to start living life with someone else, as it represents a mutual commitment to sharing a life together in a long-term partnership."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trivia question: Polaris is the brightest star in which constellation? And the answer is?","completion":"Polaris, also known as the North Star or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, commonly referred to as the Little Bear. Ursa Minor is a relatively small constellation located in the northern celestial hemisphere, which also contains the famous asterism Little Dipper. This constellation is significant for both observational astronomy and celestial navigation. Polaris, a yellow supergiant, is a Cepheid variable star, meaning it undergoes regular pulsations that cause it to vary in brightness. It is located approximately 323 to 433 light-years away from Earth. Polaris has an apparent magnitude between 1.86 and 2.13, making it one of the brightest stars visible from Earth, although not the brightest overall. Ursa Minor is a circumpolar constellation for many observers in the Northern Hemisphere, meaning it never dips below the horizon, making it visible throughout the year for the latitudes above 40 degrees. Polaris' role as the North Star is of great importance for celestial navigation since it lies very close to the north celestial pole, around which all other stars in the Northern Hemisphere appear to revolve. Thus, when observers in the Northern Hemisphere locate Polaris, they can be confident that they are facing north. In ancient times, Polaris was used extensively by sailors for navigation at sea and played a significant role in the maritime history of several civilizations. To this day, it remains an essential guiding star for amateur stargazers and astronomers alike. In conclusion, Polaris is the brightest star in the Ursa Minor constellation. Its unique position and brightness make it a cornerstone in astronomy and celestial navigation for observers in the Northern Hemisphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\"? Choices: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic,\\" it appears that the speaker is expressing a reluctance or desire to avoid engaging in activities or situations they perceive to be drastic. The term \\"drastic\\" here can be interpreted as something severe, extreme, or requiring significant effort or consequences. Now, let us examine the hypothesis, \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\" This statement also showcases the speaker's wish to abstain from participating in situations or actions that carry a significant level of seriousness or gravity. On comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they share a similarity in expressing the desire or hope to avoid extremely serious circumstances. The difference between the two statements lies in the choice of words—\\"drastic\\" in the premise and \\"serious\\" in the hypothesis. While \\"drastic\\" implies extreme or severe actions or situations, \\"serious\\" emphasizes the gravity or importance of the circumstances. Although the words \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" carry slightly different nuances, they both convey an overall sense of extremity, severity, or importance. In this context, the premise of hoping to never venture into something drastic can be reasonably related to the hypothesis of hoping not to engage in anything too serious. While the premise does not explicitly prove the hypothesis, it is suggestive of a similar wish on the part of the speaker. Considering this analysis, the most suitable answer from the given options would be, \\"it is not possible to tell\\" if the premise explicitly entails the hypothesis. Nevertheless, the premise does indicate a similar sentiment, making it reasonable to assume that the speaker may share the hope expressed in the hypothesis as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All these plants and bushes work together to make a happy place for insects, birds, and many other animals to live. Now, let's say we take away all the grasses and shrubs from this playground. Uh-oh!

The roots from the plants used to hold the soil together like glue, but now, rain and wind might wash or blow the soil away more easily. This is called erosion. 3. Without all these little plants, other bigger plants and trees might have a harder time growing because they could also lose soil and important things in the soil they need to grow big and strong.

James was born in Holton, Kansas; his mother, died in 1954 when he was five. His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. In his Baseball Book 1990, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.) James expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book The New Historical Baseball Abstract, with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote \\"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\\" This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \\"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\\" In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did. Why did he want to defend Rose?","completion":"James wanted to defend Rose because he believed that the evidence against Rose was weak and not enough to prove that he had really bet on baseball. He felt that the Dowd Report's investigation wasn't thorough and reliable, so he tried to put forward his own analysis in support of Rose, even though many people didn't agree with him.

To protect his clients' intellectual property and himself, Jennings, with the aid of his friend Shorty (Giamatti), undertakes a memory wipe to remove knowledge of his engineering. Jennings is approached by his old college roommate, James Rethrick (Eckhart), the CEO of the successful Seattle technology company Allcom. Rethrick proposes a lengthy three-year reverse engineering job to Jennings, requiring him to live on Allcom's secured campus until its conclusion but rewarding him handsomely with company stock. Jennings agrees and, after arranging for his long-term absence, arrives at Allcom, turns in his personal possessions, and is given a brief tour of the facility where he meets and flirts with botanist Dr. Rachel Porter (Thurman). He is injected with a long-term memory marker for the post-job memory wipe. Three years later (June 2007), at the conclusion of the memory wipe, Jennings is sitting in Rethrick's office, being thanked for a successful job. On returning home, Jennings finds that, although his Allcom shares would have been worth around 92 million, he had signed them away near the end of his tenure. Furthermore, he finds that his personal possessions have been replaced with an envelope containing a random assortment of everyday items. Soon after, the FBI captures him; and Agent Dodge (Morton) interrogates him on charges related to the death of physicist William Dekker. Jennings is able to escape custody, finding that the items in the envelope can be used at the right time to evade capture. After warning Shorty of his plight, he finds the items pointing him to a cafÃ© meeting with Porter. Rethrick, who has been watching Jennings' movements, discovers a message to Porter about this meeting and sends a body double to take her place to try to recover the envelope. The real Porter shows up and helps Jennings...

First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. However, in this piece of @*!^ called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with. Now, the acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art!!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. The jackasses playing the Clampets/Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break! Finally, the action. The gunfighting is so-so at BEST, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. I've seen more real-looking fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!

Empiricism The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, \\"Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition.\\" And, Q: What was Hume's nationality?","completion":"Hume was Scottish, which means he came from Scotland.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more? Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, has helped stabilize the soil more than Joe, who has a farm with depleted soil. From the hint, it is evident that depleted soils can benefit from the protection against soil erosion by groundcover plants found in agroforestry systems. Groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses, contribute to stabilizing the soil by providing increased cover as opposed to the cover found in short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a vital factor in preventing erosion. Agroforestry, which Gary has adopted, offers additional advantages such as cleaner water through the reduction of nutrient and soil surface runoff. This can be achieved by slowing down the velocity of runoff and increasing the infiltration of water into the soil. This method proves to be more effective than row-cropped fields, as it facilitates greater nutrient uptake and reduces nutrient loss into streams. In conclusion, Gary's practice of agroforestry and the growth of cover crops has resulted in healthier, more stable soil when compared to Joe's farm with depleted soil. The use of groundcover plants and the various advantages of agroforestry systems overall contribute to better soil stabilization and environmental benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Klinsmann Remains Critical of MLS As the brain trust of U.S. Soccer gathered here for the announcement of this summer’s Concacaf Gold Cup schedule, men’s national-team coach Jurgen Klinsmann took the opportunity to deliver a state-of-the-program presentation as the U.S. begins to focus on the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Much of Klinsmann’s talk here Wednesday evening centered on the challenges America’s top young players can face reaching the highest level when they choose to play in Major League Soccer instead of trying to break into the top leagues abroad. Klinsmann’s views of MLS as a league that doesn’t challenge the best American players sufficiently are well-known. Last fall, they sparked a public tête-à-tête with MLS commissioner Don Garber, who demanded that Klinsmann stop denigrating the U.S. league. That debate, however, centered largely on whether current members of the U.S. national team were taking the easy way out by accepting multimillion-dollar contracts to star in MLS instead of fighting for playing time in England, France and Germany. On Wednesday night in Philadelphia, Klinsmann seemed more concerned about younger players who, because of scheduling conflicts with MLS, might not even get to play in every game with the under-23 and under-20 national teams, since the MLS clubs aren’t required to release the players on days specified for international play, though occasionally they do. The issue is of critical importance this year because the under-23 team is trying to qualify for next year’s Rio Olympics. “Here we are a week or two away from games and Andi doesn’t know the players he will have,” Klinsmann said, referring to the under-23 coach Andreas Herzog, who is also his top assistant on the national team. The U-23 team will play in friendlies in Denmark and Bosnia-Herzegovina later this month. To Klinsmann, giving the younger players the chance to maximize their play on the junior national teams is essential if the U.S. ever wants to improve in the World Cup, where it hasn’t won a game in the knockout round since 2002, especially since some of the MLS players on the junior teams are reserve players for their clubs who struggle to get on the field. Playing for the junior national team at every opportunity would give them valuable competitive experience—as many as 15 extra games as well as practices with U.S. players at the highest level in their age group. This often isn’t an issue for European and South American leagues, where games usually don’t conflict with the FIFA dates. MLS, which Klinsmann recognizes has helped soccer development in the U.S. substantially, has to schedule games on many FIFA dates because many fall on weekends or in the summer months. MLS has learned the hard way that its fans don’t show up for midweek games, and due to the extreme North American winters, it plays a March-November schedule, while most of the rest of the world plays August-May. An MLS spokesman declined to comment. More troubling to Klinsmann though is that even the best MLS teams don’t play nearly as many games as the better European clubs. For instance, a top Premier League team in England will play close to 60 games in a season, counting its domestic and international tournaments. MLS champion LA Galaxy played just over 40 games last year in all competitions. Factor in national team games and a top MLS-based U.S. player may play roughly 80-90 games over the course of a two-year cycle whereas a top international reaches well over 100. To be sure, Klinsmann acknowledged, it does no one any good when a U.S. player signs with a European club then ends up on the bench, but all things being equal, maximizing the most intense competitive opportunities, whether at the club or junior national levels, is essential for improvement. “The most important thing is that the kid gets the chance to play,” Klinsmann said. To Klinsmann, the issue strikes at the heart of what ails U.S. soccer, which is what the public and U.S. Soccer demand of their very best players. What frustrates him the most he says, is that the players on the under-17 team can occasionally hold their own against some very good soccer nations. They beat England 3-1 in Florida in November. He said coaches rave to him about the quality of the teenage players then ask him what goes wrong as they become adults. “We don’t bridge the gap from 18-22,” he said, insisting that U.S. soccer needs to do a better job of getting players to understand how they need to live and train and work to reach the game’s highest level. Klinsmann said that he saw direct evidence of this in January when he convened a camp of 30 national team players from MLS, many of whom had been on vacation since their MLS seasons ended in November. In fitness tests, few met the national team’s standards, especially in the famed “beep test” which has players run back and forth between lines in a set period. They are expected to cover 3,200 meters. MLS players, notably Matt Besler, defended themselves saying they couldn’t be expected to be in peak condition in the middle of the off-season and were using the camp to get in shape for the March start of MLS. Klinsmann said Wednesday top international players play an 11-month season and continue to do light workouts during a four-week summer break. They don’t sit on a beach with a drink in hand. “If you take a month off it’s going to take you two months to get it back,” he said. Klinsmann, who is now also in charge of player development for U.S. Soccer, said he is in close contact with the best U.S. prospects and he expects plenty of new faces on his 2018 squad. He spoke with Jordan Morris, a talented sophomore at Stanford he called in for the recent match against the Czech Republic, about how he can get enough competition in 2015 to continue his development. He intervened in Hamburg, where Julian Green, the 19-year-old German-American who scored in the World Cup, became embroiled in a dispute with the club’s manager, who put Green on the reserve squad and asked him to prove his value to the top team. He has his sights set on Gedion Zelalem, the 18-year-old with Arsenal born in Germany to Ethiopian parents who immigrated to the U.S. as a child and is in the process of becoming eligible play for the men’s national team. Klinsmann said Zelalem is already good enough to play for the U.S. Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com","completion":"Men's national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann voiced concerns about young American soccer players choosing to play in Major League Soccer instead of top leagues abroad, stating that it doesn't challenge the best players enough.

Article: After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era, and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country, more people are openly forming interracial unions. In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \\"pass\\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American. Question: What is the effect of there no longer being a stigma on interracial marriage?","completion":"The effect of there no longer being a stigma on interracial marriage includes an increase in the number of people openly forming interracial unions and the development of a diverse society reflecting a broad range of ethno-racial backgrounds. The elimination of this stigma has also contributed to a growing multiracial identity movement since the 1980s, with more people recognizing and embracing their mixed racial origins. This change in societal attitudes has led to significant milestones, such as the inclusion of multiple ethno-racial identity options in the 2000 U.S. Census and the election of Barack Obama as the first multiracial President of the United States in 2008.

Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive.

You may feel lightheaded, weak, have a stomach cramp, or a headache. Take deep breaths, do a little stretching, and make sure you stay hydrated. As time passes, these symptoms will fade, along with your embarrassment. If the issue is the result of a group message gone awry, staying a member of the group may only make the situation worse. If a conversation gets heated or inappropriate, it's best to leave it before sending a message you might later regret.

Click the wheel icon (desktop) or the arrow icon (Messenger) at the top right corner of the message. Select “Leave Conversation” (on all platform). A notification will be sent to the others that you have left the conversation, and you won't receive any further messages. Having to look at something hurtful over and over again isn’t good for anyone. If you wince in pain every time you see the harmful message in your inbox, you can archive the message. This won’t delete it, but it’ll file it away so it’s no longer in your face. You’ll be able to find it at any time by searching for the recipient’s name.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few...

Please answer the following question: Information: - Eric John Wilson ( born February 21 , 1970 ) , is the former bass player for Sublime ( 1988 -- 1996 ) and also bassist for Long Beach Dub Allstars ( 1997 -- 2002 ) . He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Q:Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

I ran home as quickly as possible. Later on, I heard it was a neighbor, an old man who has been living alone at home. He's NOT a sleep walker. He enjoys having a walk at night. So I seldom see him in the neighborhood in the day. It's said that he was a soldier many years ago. He has two children, a son and a daughter. His son has a family in Shanghai.

Step 3: Elaborating on Critical Issues I'll further describe the critical issues that significantly affected my experience at the place. This will provide valuable insights for prospective visitors. Step 4: Acknowledge Any Positive Aspects (Optional) Even if the review is negative, I will acknowledge any positive aspects to provide a more balanced and fair perspective.

Unfortunately, our expectations were far from being met due to several major concerns. Firstly, the customer service was severely lacking - the staff seemed uninterested, and we felt genuinely unwelcome. Secondly, the cleanliness left much to be desired, as the restrooms were unsanitary, and we noticed trash scattered throughout the space. The most critical issue, however, was the uncomfortable atmosphere the place fostered. Rather than feeling like a space where friends and family could relax, we felt on edge and uneasy throughout our visit. Though I feel obligated to mention that the [Place Name] does have some redeeming qualities, such as their diverse selection of food options at their onsite restaurant, the overall experience was negatively overshadowed by the glaring issues.

Article: When Jane put out the idea of homeschooling to her parents, the first reaction they gave was, \\"You are cutting the child off the world.'' \\"Did the child really get cut off or did the child socialize better?\\" The moment we hear of homeschooling, we think the child will have no opportunities to interact with peers. However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet.

Given the question: Information: - Chronology (from Latin \\"chronologia\\", from Ancient Greek , \\"chrónos\\", \\"time\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time. Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\". - Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light from a surface such that an incident ray is reflected at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An illuminated \\"ideal\\" diffuse reflecting surface will have equal luminance from all directions which lie in the half-space adjacent to the surface (Lambertian reflectance). - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The hexagonal snowflake , a crystalline formation of ice , has intrigued people throughout history . This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes . Artists , philosophers , and scientists have wondered at their shape , recorded them by hand or in photographs , and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes . - A spectrum (plural \\"spectra\\" or \\"spectrums\\") is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. - A snowflake is either a single ice crystal or an aggregation of ice crystals which falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. What is the relationship between 'timeline of snowflake research' and 'timeline'? The answer is:","completion":"The relationship between 'timeline of snowflake research' and 'timeline' is that the 'timeline of snowflake research' is a specific example of a timeline focused on the history and chronology of research and interest regarding snowflakes. A 'timeline', in general, is a visual representation of a chronological sequence of events, used to display and organize information in the order of their occurrence in time.

These elements can be made of various materials like stone, brick, or wood, depending on your preference and budget. Step 6: Add lighting Install outdoor lighting fixtures to highlight key features of your front yard and provide a sense of safety and warmth. Use a combination of strategies like uplighting, downlighting, and path lighting for best results. Step 7: Choose outdoor decor Add decorative features like garden sculptures, bird feeders, or wind chimes to personalize the space and add charm. Be mindful not to over-clutter the space and maintain a cohesive theme throughout. Step 8: Maintenance plan Develop a maintenance schedule for the upkeep of your front yard decorations. This includes watering plants, pruning, cleaning, and replacing any broken or damaged items. Step 9: Execution With the plan in hand, start working on your front yard, either by doing it yourself or hiring professionals. Make sure to follow the layout and stick to the budget to achieve the desired outcome. Step 10: Evaluate and adjust Once the decoration is complete, evaluate the outcome and make any necessary adjustments. As seasons change, you may need to update or swap out elements to maintain the desired appearance. Done correctly, a well-decorated front yard can significantly improve curb appeal and create a welcoming environment for you and your guests alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve 4 = -m + 1 for m. And the answer is...","completion":"Okay, let's solve the problem step by step. We have the equation: 4 = -m + 1 Now, we want to find the value of 'm'. First, we should move the '1' to the other side to isolate 'm'. To move it, we'll do the opposite of addition, which is subtraction. Since '1' is being added, we'll subtract '1' from both sides: 4 - 1 = -m + 1 - 1 This simplifies to: 3 = -m Now, to solve for 'm', we need to get rid of the negative sign in front of it. We'll do the opposite of multiplication, which is division. Since 'm' is being multiplied by '-1', we'll divide both sides by '-1': 3 ÷ -1 = -m ÷ -1 This simplifies to: -3 = m So, the answer is m = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Predestination, in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul. Explanations of predestination often seek to address the \\"paradox of free will\\", whereby God's omniscience seems incompatible with human free will. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism. - The Rhône (; Walliser German: \\"Rotten\\" ) is one of the major rivers of Europe, rising in the Rhône Glacier in the Swiss Alps at the far eastern end of the Swiss canton of Valais, passing through Lake Geneva and running through southeastern France. At Arles, near its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea, the river divides into two branches, known as the Great Rhône (French: \\"Le Grand Rhône\\") and the Little Rhône (\\"Le Petit Rhône\\"). The resulting delta constitutes the Camargue region. - John Calvin (; born : 10 July 150927 May 1564) was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism, aspects of which include the doctrines of predestination and of the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation, in which doctrines Calvin was influenced by and elaborated upon the Augustinian and other early Christian traditions. Various Congregational, Reformed, and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law.

He is most often remembered for having persuaded John Calvin to remain in Geneva in 1536 , and for persuading him to return there in 1541 , after their expulsion in 1538 . They influenced the government of Geneva to the point that it became the \`\` Protestant Rome '' , where Protestants took refuge and non-Protestants were driven out . Together with Calvin , Farel worked to train missionary preachers who spread the Protestant cause to other countries , and especially to France . - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World). - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - Calvinism (also called the Reformed tradition, Reformed Christianity, Reformed Protestantism, or the Reformed faith) is a major branch of Protestantism which follows the theological tradition and the forms of Christian practice that were developed by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

A. not enough information B. he wanted his wife and a good life C. he wanted to build a family D. he believed he could change his orientation","completion":"Based on the details presented in the narrative, the most reasonable inference that could be made about the reason the author's husband married her is D. He believed he could change his orientation. Reading this touching and incredibly personal narrative about the author's experience, we get to know that her husband has been battling same-sex attraction for as long as he could remember. Importantly, it seems that in his teens, he sought help from a church counselor, who advised him that marriage could be a potential fix or \\"cure\\" for his inclinations towards the same sex. As a young man likely desperate for a semblance of normalcy and acceptance during a time that might not have been as supportive or accepting of homosexuality, he likely clung onto this counsel as hope. Under such advice, the husband might have thought marrying a woman would assist him in combating or masking his homosexual tendencies and ultimately believed it could change his orientation. This notion was potentially further motivated by societal norms or expectations depending on their cultural, religious, geographical, or temporal context, which might have viewed homosexuality negatively or even as a disorder that needed to be \\"fixed.\\" It should be noted, however, that this isn't to say that options B. he wanted his wife and a good life, or C. he wanted to build a family, couldn't be true. It is entirely possible that he genuinely wanted a fulfilling life with his wife, and a family just like any other individual. However, the question asked pertains to the primary reason behind the marriage. In that context, the narrative strongly points to D. He believed he could change his orientation, guided by misguided counsel that the marriage could \\"cure\\" him. By laying out these details and inferring from the narrative, it's clear that this was a complex and challenging circumstance. It is also crucial that we understand today that sexuality is not a choice and that it cannot be \\"cured\\" or changed. It is a core aspect of individual self-identity and self-expression, wherein open dialogue, acceptance, and understanding should always be encouraged."},{"prompt":"Question: Who is a father figure for Jim?

Copper is a very efficient conductor of electricity, meaning when a lot of copper is used to make wire, the wire can carry a large amount of electrical current from the source to the piece of metal. This creates a very strong magnetic field. If there is not much copper available, this means a smaller or thinner wire is used. A smaller or thinner wire can carry less electrical current from the source to the metal. This reduces the strength of the magnetic field the current can create. Therefore, if there isn't much copper available, there will be less electric source and subsequently, a weaker magnetic field will be produced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 21 February 1915, Endurance, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \\"dogloos\\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200 miles (320 km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.In February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles (153 km) since 19 January. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \\"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \\"she would be crushed like an eggshell\\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area.

Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds. The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

Given the following passage \\"In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.\\", answer the following question.

Q:- Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process is the utilization or manipulation of the created electromagnet, followed by the ability to switch the magnetic field on or off by controlling the flow of electric current through the wire. This can be done by simply connecting or disconnecting the power source or by regulating the current using a switch or a variable resistor. This versatile control over the generated magnetic field makes electromagnets highly suitable for varied applications across industries and technologies. In this context, the main applications of electromagnets can be categorized into the following areas: 1. Lifting and moving heavy magnetic materials: Electromagnets are widely used in scrapyards, recycling plants, and heavy machine industries for lifting and moving large metal objects such as heavy steel plates, bulky scrap pieces, and cars. 2. Electromagnetic locks: Electromagnets are utilized in electromagnetic locks to secure doors and gates. When current flows through the electromagnet, it creates a strong magnetic field, attracting the armature plate and ensuring secure locking. This system can be easily controlled using an electric switch, offering a high level of security for access control systems. 3. Electric motors: Electromagnets form the core component of electric motors, where the rotating magnetic field interacts with the stationary magnetic field to produce mechanical work. These motors are used in various applications, from small household appliances to large industrial machines. 4. Transformers and inductors: Electromagnets help transfer electrical energy between two or more coils in transformers, enabling voltage conversion to facilitate efficient power transmission, voltage regulation, and control in electrical circuits. 5. Maglev trains: Electromagnets support magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains by creating both lift and propulsion force. These trains hover above the tracks owing to the force of repulsion between the train (magnetic field) and the rail (electromagnet). The lack of friction reduces wear and tear, resulting in lower maintenance and higher speed capabilities. 6. Medical and scientific equipment: Electromagnets have a crucial role in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines that use powerful magnetic fields to obtain detailed images of a patient's body. They are also employed in particle accelerators for manipulating subatomic particles during research. 7. Data storage: Electromagnets are used to read and write magnetic data onto storage devices such as hard disk drives. 8. Magnetic switches and relays: In control systems and electronics, electromagnets serve as the core of magnetic switches and relays, enabling the efficient control of high current or high voltage circuits using small signals as inputs. These applications demonstrate the adaptability and efficacy of electromagnets as a powerful tool, thanks to the controlled generation of a magnetic field upon introducing an electric current. The ability to manipulate the magnetic field by adjusting the current flow makes them a cornerstone technology in various industries and everyday life."},{"prompt":"Given a sentence in Italian, generate a new Italian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Prior to the start of the 2017-18 NBA season season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by moving Kyrie Irving to the 2017-18 Boston Celtics season, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the 2017-18 Washington Wizards season where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; for example, on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double-digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 9.2 assists and 4.2 turnovers per game. In the 2018 NBA Playoffs, he guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the 2017-18 Golden State Warriors season. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the 2017-18 Indiana Pacers season and another against the 2017-18 Toronto Raptors season. In the first game of the 2018 NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime. Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Under House Bill Two (HB2), transgender people must use toilets that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The bill also removed several anti-discrimination measures. North Carolina is under mounting pressure to repeal the bill, which has already led some businesses, entertainers and teams to boycott the state. The NBA moved its high-revenue 2017 All Star game from Charlotte and the NCAA itself moved seven games from the state during the current season. The state stands to lose up to 3.8bn (Â£3bn) over 12 years as a result of the boycott, AP news agency says. However state officials have failed to reach an agreement despite months of negotiations. On Tuesday Republicans in the US Congress and North Carolina's Democratic governor blamed each other for the continuing impasse.

There's no evidence that shows that the child will remain healthy, although complex testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering . If so, it would mark only the world' s second reported cure. Specialists say Sunday's announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to remove HIV infection in children, especially in African countries where too many babies are born with the virus. \\"You could call this about as close to a cure,\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who is familiar with the findings, told The Associated Press. A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than usual, starting a three-drug mixture within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor . \\"I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,\\" Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Next, Persaud's team is planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. \\"Maybe we'll be able to block this reservoir seeding.\\" Persaud said. No one should stop anti-AIDS drugs as a result of this case, Fauci warned.

Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War.

In contrast, fish have a two-chambered heart that is a part of their less efficient single-circulatory system. Oxygen-poor blood is pumped from the heart to the gills for gas exchange, where it becomes oxygen-rich and then flows directly to the rest of the body.

If \\"A woman wearing a hat and clunky high heels is sitting on a park bench under a tree.\\", does this mean that \\"The hat is red.\\"?","completion":"The original statement \\"A woman wearing a hat and clunky high heels is sitting on a park bench under a tree\\" does not provide any explicit information about the color of the hat. It merely describes the woman's attire, stating that she is wearing a hat and clunky high heels while sitting on a park bench under a tree. To infer that \\"The hat is red,\\" one would need additional information or context that specifies the color of the hat. There might be several reasons why one might assume that the hat is red, such as: 1. Personal experience: They may have encountered similar situations where people were wearing red hats, leading them to generalize and assume that the hat in question is also red. 2. Stereotypes or cultural associations: Some people might associate hats with certain colors due to cultural influences, movies, or books. For example, if they have read a story about a woman wearing a red hat while sitting in a park, they might be inclined to think that the hat in the given scenario is red. 3. Context or environment: If the setting of the story or situation is surrounded by red hues or themes, one might assume that the hat could be red. However, this would still be a speculative assumption and not a definite fact. In conclusion, without any additional context or information validating the color of the hat, it would be incorrect to conclude that \\"The hat is red\\" based solely on the original statement.

The premise \\"How about the Ritz?\\" is a simple suggestion, which doesn't provide enough information to accurately compare The Ritz to other available options. In order to holistically evaluate the hypothesis's validity, we must consider several factors and gather more information about the context in which the suggestion has been made. 1. Context: First, we need to establish a context for the suggestion. Is it a hotel, restaurant, or an event venue? Understanding the nature of the establishment will help us in comparing it to the relevant alternatives. 2. Purpose: What is the objective of the suggestion? Are we selecting a place for dining, lodging, or for hosting an event? Knowing the purpose will allow for a more meaningful comparison, as different establishments excel at different aspects. 3. Criteria: We need to identify the specific criteria deemed important, such as luxuriousness, location, price, quality, and customer service. A clear understanding of what is valued will help us adequately evaluate the Ritz against other options. 4. Alternatives: To make a sound judgment, we need to know the available alternatives that are being considered. In order to assert that the Ritz is better, we must gather information about other options and closely compare them based on the established criteria. 5. Personal Preferences: Different people have different preferences, so it's crucial to consider personal opinions and tastes when evaluating an option. While someone may argue that the Ritz is the best option, it may not be the case for someone else who has a different taste or prioritizes different aspects while making a selection. 6. Reviews and Recommendations: In order to validate the hypothesis, we could also gather information from customer reviews, ratings, and recommendations, as these can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the Ritz compared to other available options. 7. Previous Experiences: Personal experiences play a critical role in shaping our preferences; thus, accounting for prior encounters with the Ritz or any other alternatives can also influence the evaluation process. In conclusion, based on the simple premise of \\"How about the Ritz?\\", it is not possible to confirm the hypothesis \\"The Ritz is better than the other options\\" as true. To make a well-informed judgment, we must gather more information and engage in a thorough analysis, considering various factors such as context, purpose, criteria, alternatives, personal preferences, reviews, recommendations, and past experiences.

When this was found out her parents got tested fur the mutation and neither of them had it, As of today she is very concerned because she would like to he children. But I can use this background: For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome. What is an answer for this question: Will a baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia have a higher or lower chance of survival shortly after birth? A:","completion":"A baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia will have a lower chance of survival shortly after birth. This is because when two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance the child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene, which is fatal. In this scenario, the child's chances break down as follows: 1. 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene, leading to homozygous achondroplasia, which is fatal. 2. 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the mutated gene from one parent, resulting in heterozygous achondroplasia, meaning the child will also have achondroplasia. 3. 25% chance of inheriting no mutated genes and having a normal phenotype. Thus, the probability of a baby born to parents with achondroplasia surviving shortly after birth is lower due to the 25% risk of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republicans kills civil unions in U.S. state DENVER (AP) – A last-ditch effort by Colorado's governor to give gay couples in the state rights similar to married couples failed Monday after Republicans rejected the proposal during a special legislative session. Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper had said the special session was needed to address a \\"fundamental question of fairness and civil rights.\\" The bill's demise was expected by Democrats, who have begun using the issue as a rallying cry to topple Republicans in the November elections. Republicans assigned the bill to House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which was likely to reject it. The panel voted 5-4 along party lines to kill the measure. \\"The gay community is being used as a political pawn,\\" said Republican Rep. Don Coram, whose son is gay. Coram voted against the measure. Rep. Mark Ferrandino, the Democrats' leader in the House and gay lawmaker co-sponsoring civil unions, sounded a note of optimism before the committee hearing, even as he braced for the bill's rejection. \\"If it fails this year, we're going to work hard to make sure the public understands what happened, the games that were played, and next we're going to push it again,\\" he said. \\"And as I've said a number of times, it's not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when.' And the 'when' keeps getting sooner and sooner. This will happen.\\" House Republicans hold a 33-32 voting advantage, but there was enough support for civil unions to pass. Last week, Democrats tried to force Republicans who control the calendar to bring up the bill for debate. But it became clear Republicans were filibustering by unnecessarily talking at length about other bills. Republicans then halted work for hours, killing the bill and several others that needed a vote before a key deadline. \\"Transparency, accountability and the virtues of good government are compromised when the legislative clock is used to avoid consideration of important legislation,\\" the governor said in a letter to lawmakers before the special session started. The regular session adjourned Wednesday, the same day an emotional Hickenlooper announced his intent to call a special session over civil unions and other bills that died because of the GOP filibuster. More than a dozen states allow either gay marriage or civil unions, including several that moved to pass such laws this year. The debate in Colorado is playing out at a time when President Obama became the first U.S. president to publicly endorse gay marriage. But North Carolina voters approved a constitutional amendment that bars civil unions and defines marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Earlier Monday, hundreds of supporters wearing red and waving signs greeted lawmakers returning to Denver for the special session. Many of the gay-rights activists predicted the bill's demise. They urged Democrats to make the civil unions failure a rallying point for November. \\"For too long Democrats have let the right corner the market no talking about values. Finally we've claimed the moral high ground, and we can talk about that,\\" said activist Wiley Sherer, who was selling buttons that read, \\"Ignorance is forgivable. Pride in ignorance never is.\\" Undeterred by the civil unions delay, Sherer said, \\"It's going to happen eventually. I mean, there's no way in 10 years we don't have nationwide marriage equality.\\" Conservatives, who argue civil unions undermine traditional marriage, portrayed the special session as a waste of taxpayer money. As they have before, Republicans described the measure as a proposal for gay marriage, rather than civil unions. Civil unions would grant gay couples rights similar to married couples, including letting partners make medical decisions for each other. The protections also would enhance parental and inheritance rights.

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

If you've just spilled bleach on your carpet, there might still be time to save its color if you act quickly. Run a towel or cloth under cold water, squeeze it out, then use it to blot out the affected area.","completion":"Make sure not to rub the stain, as this may worsen the situation or spread the bleach to other areas of the carpet. Instead, gently press the cloth onto the stain, soaking up as much of the bleach as possible. You may need to do this several times until most of the bleach has been absorbed from the carpet. Next, mix together a solution of water and dish soap. One cup of warm water mixed with a few drops of dish soap should be sufficient. Apply this solution to a clean cloth, and gently dab the stained area to help lift any remaining bleach residue from the carpet fibers. Keep in mind that, while dish soap is a mild detergent, it's essential not to use too much, as this can leave a soapy residue in the carpet that attracts dirt. After you've applied the mixture, use another clean, damp cloth to remove the soap and water mix from the carpet by pressing it gently onto the treated area. It may be necessary to repeat this step several times to ensure that all of the soap has been removed from the carpet. For the next step, mix equal parts vinegar and water to create a natural bleaching agent. This will help to neutralize the remaining bleach and mitigate any further damage to your carpet. Apply this vinegar solution to a clean cloth and gently dab it onto the stained area. However, please test this mixture on an inconspicuous area of your carpet before applying it to the stain; some carpet materials may be sensitive to vinegar. Once you've applied the vinegar solution, take another clean, damp cloth to gently blot out any excess liquid from the carpet. If the stain still appears to be visible, repeat this process until you've achieved the desired results. After you've addressed the bleach stain, it's important to properly dry the carpet area. Use clean, dry towels to blot any remaining moisture from the carpet, applying gentle pressure to help speed up the drying process. You can also use a fan or a hairdryer on a cool setting to expedite the process and prevent the risk of mold growth. Lastly, once the carpet is completely dry, consider using a carpet cleaner to further address any lingering discoloration. Choose a carpet cleaner specifically suited to your carpet's material and color, following the manufacturer's instructions for use. Additionally, it is advisable to consult with a professional carpet cleaning service for expert guidance on stain removal and repair techniques. While bleach stains can be disheartening, taking immediate action and following these steps may help mitigate the damage and restore your carpet's appearance as much as possible. Remember to always be cautious when handling bleach products and store them correctly to reduce the chances of accidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: and the situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Answer the following question: Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","completion":"Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth because it is farther from the Sun, and as a result, it has a larger orbit. As mentioned, the farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it must travel. Since Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, it has a much larger orbital path than Earth and therefore travels a longer distance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its translation to English would be: \\"Statistics reveal that annually more than 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed on our roads, and up to 300,000 are injured.\\" To understand the translation process, it might help to break it down: 1. \\"Aus Statistiken geht hervor,\\" - This translates into \\"Statistics reveal,\\". 'Aus' means 'from', 'Statistiken' translates to 'statistics', 'geht hervor' is a phrase that means 'it emerges' or 'revealed'. 2. \\"dass jährlich über 8 000 Fußgänger und Radfahrer auf unseren Straßen ums Leben kommen\\" - This section means: \\"that annually more than 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed on our roads\\". Here, 'dass' translates to 'that', 'jährlich' means 'annually', 'über' means 'more than', '8 000 Fußgänger und Radfahrer' translates to '8,000 pedestrians and cyclists', 'auf unseren Straßen' means 'on our roads'. Finally, 'ums Leben kommen' is a phrase that means 'to get killed' or 'to lose one’s life'. 3. \\"und bis zu 300 000 verletzt werden.\\" - This translates into \\"and up to 300,000 are injured.\\" 'Und' means 'and', 'bis zu' is 'up to', '300 000 verletzt werden' translates to '300,000 are injured'. Please bear in mind, translations may differ slightly based on the context and nuance in the sentence. Furthermore, in some languages like German, larger numbers are often written with spaces instead of commas (e.g., 8 000 instead of 8,000), but in the English-speaking world, it is standard to use commas for this purpose.

Answer:","completion":"The supporting actress featured in the 1935 Hindi-language Indian film \\"Bombay Mail\\" who later became best known for her songs \\"Sun Bairi Baalam Sach Bol Re\\" from \\"Bawre Nain\\" (1950), \\"Ghabrekar Ke Jo Hum Sir Ko Takraayan\\" in \\"Mahal\\" (1949), and \\"Najariya Ki Maari\\" in \\"Pakeezah\\" (1972) is the talented Rajkumari Dubey. Rajkumari Dubey, widely known by only her first name, Rajkumari, was born on 1924 in Benaras (also known as Varanasi), Uttar Pradesh, India. She started her career in the Indian film industry at an early age, and her soulful and melodious voice, along with her ability to sing different genres of music, helped her establish a name for herself in the playback singing sector. During her career, she worked with a number of renowned music directors like Khemchand Prakash, Anil Biswas, Ghulam Haider, and Naushad Ali. Although her role in the 1935 film \\"Bombay Mail\\" was a supporting one, she gained immense recognition for her impeccable singing skills. Her song \\"Sun Bairi Baalam Sach Bol Re,\\" composed by Roshan, became an all-time hit, and even today, it is considered a classic. Rajkumari's songs always had a certain charm and simplicity that captivated the audience. In the 1949 film \\"Mahal,\\" directed by Kamal Amrohi, Rajkumari lent her voice to the iconic song \\"Ghabrekar Ke Jo Hum Sir Ko Takraayan,\\" which was a duet with Mukesh under the music direction of Khemchand Prakash. The haunting melodies made the song an instant classic, and it garnered immense appreciation from critics and listeners alike. Rajkumari's song \\"Najariya Ki Maari\\" in the 1972 film \\"Pakeezah,\\" directed by Kamal Amrohi, is yet another testimony to her remarkable talent. The film starred iconic actors Meena Kumari and Raaj Kumar, and the legendary Ghulam Mohammed composed its music. Rajkumari's charming voice paired with Mohammed's excellent composition created a song that is still remembered fondly by music lovers. Despite facing stiff competition from other legendary singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Geeta Dutt, and others, Rajkumari Dubey managed to carve out her own niche in the world of Indian film music. Her unique voice and versatile singing style will forever be cherished by fans of Hindi film music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson.

Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another.

Answer based on context: at M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Maryland TV Time: CBS 1:00pm eastern The Chargers went to Baltimore for the first time since 2000. The Chargers led down the field first with a 31-yard touchdown pass to WR Malcom Floyd. However, this was followed two drives later by an interception by OLB Bart Scott (who was named September's Defensive Player of the Month recently before the game), which led to a 5-yard touchdown pass from QB Steve McNair to TE Daniel Wilcox. In the second quarter, 2 Chargers field goals from kicker Nate Kaeding put San Diego in the lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Ravens' defense held the Chargers to no points. They were assisted by a loud stadium, which led to a fourth quarter intentional safety by Chargers punter Mike Scifres. The Ravens took the ball at the 40-yard line with 3:12 to go. After Derrick Mason dropped a possible touchdown pass early in the drive, a 10-yard pass to TE Todd Heap won the game with 30 seconds to play. On the touchdown catch, Heap broke a tackle from Shawne Merriman. With the win, the Ravens were 4-0 for the first time in their 11-year history. However, Guard Edwin Mulitalo was injured for the entire season with a triceps injury. How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass over the shortest one?","completion":"In the provided context, there are two touchdown passes mentioned: 1. A 31-yard touchdown pass to WR Malcom Floyd. 2. A 5-yard touchdown pass from QB Steve McNair to TE Daniel Wilcox. To find out how many yards longer the longest touchdown pass was over the shortest one, subtract the yardage of the shortest touchdown pass from the yardage of the longest one: 31 yards (longest) - 5 yards (shortest) = 26 yards So, the longest touchdown pass was 26 yards longer than the shortest one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However the town centre serves a greater area of approximately 60,000. - Telford and Wrekin is a unitary district with borough status in the West Midlands region of England. The district was created in 1974 as The Wrekin, then a non-metropolitan district of Shropshire. In 1998 the district became a unitary authority and was renamed Telford and Wrekin. It remains part of the Shropshire ceremonial county and shares institutions such as the Fire and Rescue Service and Community Health with the rest of Shropshire. - The head teacher, headmaster, headmistress, head, or principal (sometimes another title is used) is the teacher with the greatest responsibility for the management of a College. - Telford is a large new town in the borough of Telford and Wrekin and ceremonial county of Shropshire, England, about east of Shrewsbury, and west of Birmingham.

Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales.

Nice to look at, the film's glum Miami Vice plot is subverted by the jiggy flavour of a film that's nothing more than an excuse for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith to play cops and robbers for two hours. 3.

On one hand, it is criticized for being a disingenuous Hollywood production, filled with flashy explosions, shallow plot, and formulaic action sequences. The movie is also seen as an excuse for its lead actors to engage in on-screen antics, featuring headache-inducing closeups and chaotic camera moves. Furthermore, the screenplay is considered lackluster and follows a commonly used narrative that leads the audience to a predictable dead end. On the other hand, some reviews find the film to be visually appealing and an enjoyable action comedy, despite its apparent over-reliance on action and banter. The shoot'em-up aspect of the movie has been found amusing by some, while others acknowledge the film's potential if only it had a better screenplay. In summary, the movie has its fair share of shortcomings, but it might cater to the taste of audiences who can overlook the formulaic action and focus on its visual appeal and banter between the lead actors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His aim is to extract the powerful resources hidden beneath the surface, hoping to solve the energy crisis and pave the way for a more sustainable future. Little does he know that this well-intentioned ambition will ultimately lead to his tragic death. The story begins with Karl successfully creating the most powerful drilling machine the world has ever seen, capable of generating enough heat to penetrate the Earth's crust easily. With his core team consisting of his daughter, Anna, a specialized geologist; his assistant, Peter, an explosives expert; and four other reputable scientists, Karl embarks on an adventure that takes them to the deep reaches of the Earth's core. As they progress, they make remarkable discoveries about the Earth's composition and the unimaginable treasures it holds. However, they also find that they are not alone: deep in the Earth's bowels exists a formidable and hostile alien race known as the Horologians. These beings possess time-manipulation abilities and have been dormant for millennia, waiting for the right moment to return to the surface and reclaim their territory. Though tempted to retreat, Karl and his team decide that they must now find a way to stop the Horologians from reaching the surface. Anna, with her geological prowess, discovers that some of the minerals they've collected can disrupt the Horologians' time-manipulating abilities. Peter deduces that with the right combination of these minerals and explosives strategically placed, they can eliminate the Horologians once and for all. As Karl and his team prepare the counterattack, the Horologians learn of their plans and ambush them. In the ensuing battle, Peter is gravely wounded, and it falls to Karl to complete the mission. With the weight of the Earth's fate on his shoulders, Karl finds the courage to face the alien threat head-on. In a thrilling, underground showdown, Karl detonates the explosive, eradicating the Horologians and rendering their time manipulation abilities inert. However, the explosion also causes a catastrophic chain reaction of fires that quickly surges toward Karl. Despite his best effort to escape, Karl knows that sacrifices must be made for the greater good and accepts his fate. As Karl sacrifices his life for the survival of the Earth, Anna and the surviving members of the team, though mourning their losses, return to the surface to share their experiences and findings with the world. In a bittersweet ending, the world comes together to celebrate the newfound resources and the fallen heroes who gave everything to protect them. Anna vows to continue her father's work, aimed at creating a more sustainable and unified world, in honor of his memory and sacrifice.

In the first sentence, \\"The old house served as a dwelling for Albert,\\" we see that an old house is being used as a place to live for Albert.

In the second sentence, \\"He built a modest dwelling near the pond,\\" the term \\"dwelling\\" refers to a simple or unpretentious living space that was built by someone near a pond.

Answer:","completion":"The woman in the dialogue is still working because she has to finish her report. In the conversation, the man notices that she looks tired and suggests that she should go and have a good rest. However, the woman responds by expressing her desire to take a break but states that she cannot at the moment due to the urgency of her work.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Where did the president go on to greener fields? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Atlanta - Mars - not enough information - the Moon Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the text, the correct answer is: - not enough information. The text does not provide sufficient details about the president's destination after leaving the company. It only mentions that the president was going on to \\"greener fields,\\" which is a metaphorical expression meaning better opportunities or an improved situation.

Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station.

The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Lord's Prayer A:","completion":"Title: A General's Redemption Step 1: Establish main characters - James MacArthur: A seasoned and respected general who has done multiple tours and has a reputation for being tough yet compassionate. - Private Thomas Griggs: A young, promising soldier, new to the battlefield, and under MacArthur's wing. - Sarah Thompson: A war journalist who is embedded with the troops and develops a close relationship with MacArthur and Griggs. Step 2: Introduce the conflict The story is set in a war-torn country where the U.S. military is fighting to restore peace and stability to the region. MacArthur, a man of faith, who has been struggling with the moral consequences of violence and the loss of lives under his command, is questioned by Sarah Thompson in an interview. This makes him ponder about what he truly believes and what he's fighting for. Step 3: Develop relationships and subplots - As the film progresses, a close bond forms between MacArthur, Griggs, and Thompson, illustrating the human side of war, and MacArthur's fatherly relationship with Griggs unfolds. - Thompson develops a romantic relationship with a local and empathizes with the plight of the civilians caught in the crossfire. - MacArthur reflects on his past experiences, grappling with faith, loss, and guilt for the first time. Step 4: Climax In the climax, the troops are ambushed while attempting a risky rescue mission to save civilians trapped in a war zone. MacArthur, against the odds, and risking his own life, leads a successful mission, but not without significant casualties, including Private Griggs. Step 5: Resolution With the war drawing to an end, MacArthur is awarded honors for his service and his role in saving the civilians. He gives a powerful speech during a memorial service, acknowledging the sacrifices made by those under his command and struggling to reconcile his beliefs with the realities of war. MacArthur, during the speech, becomes emotional and is unable to continue, closing with reciting the Lord's Prayer. A General's Redemption tells a powerful and emotional story of the struggles of war, faith, and redemption.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding. Answer:","completion":"The name of the attack that Terry Nichols helped plan, and for which he is serving life in prison without parole, is the Oklahoma City bombing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try...

And I was wondering How would Tracy feel as a result? A:","completion":"Tracy most likely feels a mix of emotions as a result of Remy following them home and taunting them until they got inside. Undoubtedly, they must feel threatened and disturbed by Remy's actions. Examining the answer options given: a). A mean person: Although this option refers to Remy as a mean person, it is crucial to acknowledge that Tracy may indeed perceive Remy as mean, aggressive, and even malicious. Remy's behavior of following and taunting shows complete disregard for personal boundaries and a lack of empathy towards Tracy. Moreover, this can cause significant emotional stress. b). Like filing a police report: This option suggests Tracy may feel the need to involve law enforcement due to Remy's behavior. If they felt seriously threatened, unsafe, or scared, filing a police report would be a reasonable response. Reporting Remy's actions to the police may provide some level of safety and security for Tracy. They could believe that this would deter Remy from causing further harm, hold him accountable, and ensure their protection in the future. c). Hurt by Remy: This option points to the emotional aspect of Tracy's experience. It could mean that Tracy feels hurt, emotionally scarred, or betrayed by Remy, especially if they had a prior relationship or friendship. The mental and emotional trauma caused by this event should not be understated – Tracy may suffer from anxiety, fear, and a constant feeling of vulnerability. To sum up, as a result of Remy's actions, Tracy may feel a wide range of emotions, including feeling threatened, fearful, hurt, and betrayed. While all three answers (a mean person, like filing a police report, and hurt by Remy) can play a part in Tracy's responses, it's essential to view the situation with empathy and understanding for the depth of emotions Tracy likely experiences. The answer encompassing these feelings would be a combination of options: Tracy might perceive Remy as a mean person (a) while also feeling hurt by Remy's actions (c) and considering filing a police report as a necessary step to protect themselves (b)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we want to isolate the term 5*s. To do this, we need to get rid of the 9 on the same side of the equation as 5*s. We can achieve this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation: 5*s + 9 - 9 = 34 - 9 This simplifies to: 5*s = 25 Step 2: Solve for the variable (s). Now that we have isolated the term containing the variable s (5*s = 25), we need to get s by itself. Since 5 is multiplied by s, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: (5*s)/5 = 25/5 This simplifies to: s = 5 So, the value of s that satisfies the equation 5*s + 9 = 34 is s = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Curiosity brought me to this establishment, lured by their intriguing menu, and the desire for a memorable dining experience. Unfortunately, the night was anything but enjoyable. Upon arrival, the ambiance was sub-par. It was apparent that a cramped layout forced customers to be packed in like sardines. Conversations were difficult to maintain due to the constant noise and interruption from neighboring tables. The lighting, while seemingly intended to provide a romantic setting, created a dismal atmosphere that made menu selection a challenge. After being seated for nearly 15 minutes without a word from any staff member, a disheveled server begrudgingly took our drink orders, completely lacking in warmth or sincerity. As minutes turned into a half-hour, we were left parched and increasing concerned about the state of our appetizers. When we finally caught the attention of our server for an update, they brushed us off, saying the kitchen was quite busy and our food would be out shortly. This proved to be a recurring theme throughout the evening, as we repeatedly had to flag down the server to address our concerns and request essentials such as water or extra plates. Speaking of the food, it too left much to be desired. We began with the appetizer sampler platter, which I regret to say was a rather unappetizing mess. The calamari was rubbery, and the potato skins looked as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The only redeeming dish was the bruschetta; however, the proportions were paltry, bordering on ridiculous. As for our entrees, the steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked the medium-rare request I had explicitly made. The accompanying garlic mashed potatoes tasted like they came from an instant box mix – a true offense considering the price of the meal. My partner, who had ordered the seafood pasta, was disheartened at the small portion size and minimal seafood offering, which was merely a few unimpressive shrimp and a couple of sad, shriveled mussels. Despite our lukewarm feelings about the main dishes, we optimistically attempted dessert, hoping a sweet ending would salvage the experience. Alas, we were sorely mistaken. The chocolate lava cake arrived not warm and gooey but cold and hard. The “molten” center was nonexistent, completely solidified. Ultimately, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend XYZ Restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable night out. Between the long wait times, inattentive service, unpalatable food, and high prices, there is little left to justify giving this establishment even one star. Unfortunately, our time and resources were wasted on a dining experience that instilled little more than regret and disillusionment. A positive review may have been possible with better service and quality food, but as it stands, I encourage would-be patrons to look elsewhere for an upscale dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Marines, also known as a marine corps or naval infantry, are an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land, as well as the execution of their own operations. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army like the \\"Troupes de marine\\" (French Marines) and \\"Givati Brigade\\" (Israeli Marines), or form an independent armed service branch like the United States Marine Corps. - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines. - Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816 September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War. - The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also known as Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, took place on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia Campaign. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. - Charles Sidney Winder ( October 18 , 1829 -- August 9 , 1862 ) , was a career United States Army officer and a Confederate general officer in the American Civil War . He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain . - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed.

It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast. When small, the sac cannot be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy, as there may be a yolk sac, though a fetal pole is not seen. For diagnosis, the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established. The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed. A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac, or an MGD >25 mm with no embryo. Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown--rump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -226*l + 81*l - 474 = 541 for l, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. -226*l and 81*l are like terms because they both have the variable l. Add them together. -226*l + 81*l = -145*l The equation now becomes: -145*l - 474 = 541 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable. Add 474 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (l) on one side of the equation. -145*l - 474 + 474 = 541 + 474 This simplifies to: -145*l = 1015 Step 3: Solve for l. Now, divide both sides of the equation by -145 to find the value of l. -145*l / -145 = 1015 / -145 This simplifies to: l = -7 So the answer is l = -7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Movie title: A Few Good Men Context: Late one evening, at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, two Marines, Private First Class Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) are arrested for assaulting and killing a fellow Marine of their unit, PFC William Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo).At first it is assumed that they attacked Santiago because he reported Dawson to the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) for illegally firing his gun at a guard on the Cuban side of the island. However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \\"Code Red\\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt.

This option best aligns with the context since Kai has demonstrated initiative and interest in pursuing job opportunities. By calling the employers to set up an interview, Kai can further explore each potential job, ask any additional questions, and gauge whether the positions are suitable for him. It also allows the employers to evaluate Kai as a potential candidate and assess his qualifications, skills, and fit for the role. Option A (Call the employers to cancel their interview) does not align with the context since there is no mention of interviews being scheduled in the first place. Furthermore, it contradicts Kai's efforts to explore potential jobs and actively gather information about them.

He and a small group of people sail to the Bay of Bengal after learning that his oil rig had been sunk by a band of pirates. The boat becomes trapped in a waterspout and Sinbad refuses to go back, ignoring the pleas of his crew. The boat gets abducted above the sea and he is marooned ashore. Sinbad battles a Hatzegopterx and meets up with his surviving crew, Gemma, Whitaker, Mehrak the pirate captain, and Atash the oil tanker captain and his crew member. Sinbad also encounters Loa, a native warrior living on the island. Loa tells Sinbad that he must fulfill a long-forgotten pledge to become a warrior and save the island from an El Nino made by Elmec Ishu, a supernatural force that is angered by the oil spill after Sinbad's rig is sunk. The island suddenly experiences a violent earthquake, and the group then jumps on a log, which is actually the back of a large but harmless sea creature. They are later bombarded by a flock of large flying reptiles (called Rocs in the film), which think they're intruders. Meanwhile, Simon, the headmaster of Sinbad's company, takes over while Sinbad is missing. The group manage to fight off a Roc and flee the swarm, but a crew member is injured by another Roc.

Summarize this article: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reaped a gain of nearly 2.3 billion last year when he exercised 60 million stock options just before the online social networking leader's initial public offering. The windfall detailed in regulatory documents filed Friday saddled Zuckerberg, 28, with a massive tax bill. He raised the money to pay it by selling 30.2 million Facebook Inc. shares for 38 apiece, or 1.1 billion, in the IPO. Facebook's stock hasn't closed above 38 since the IPO was completed last May. The shares gained 71 cents Friday to close at 26.85. The 29 percent decline from Facebook's IPO price has cost Zuckerberg nearly 7 billion on paper, based on the 609.5 million shares of company stock that he owned as of March 31, according to the regulatory filing. His current stake is still worth 16.4 billion. Zuckerberg, who started Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room in 2004, has indicated he has no immediate plans to sell more stock. The exercise of Zuckerberg's stock options and his subsequent sale of shares in the IPO had been previously disclosed. The proxy statement filed to announce Facebook's June 11 shareholder meeting is the first time that the magnitude of Zuckerberg's stock option gain had been quantified. The proxy also revealed that Zuckerberg's pay package last year rose 16 percent because of increased personal usage of jets chartered by the company as part of his security program. Zuckerberg's compensation last year totaled nearly 2 million, up from 1.7 million last year. Of those amounts, 1.2 million covered the costs of Zuckerberg's personal air travel last year, up from 692,679 in 2011. If not for the spike in travel costs, Zuckerberg's pay would have declined by 17 percent. His salary and bonus totaled 769,306 last year versus 928,833 in 2011. Zuckerberg will take a big pay cut this year. His annual salary has been reduced to 1 and he will no longer receive a bonus, according to Facebook's filing. That puts Zuckerberg's current cash compensation on the same level as Google CEO and co-founder Larry Page, whose stake in his company is worth about 20 billion. The Associated Press formula for determining an executive's total compensation calculates salary, bonuses, perquisites, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. The AP formula does not count changes in the present value of pension benefits or stock option gains such as those recognized by Zuckerberg did last year. ||||| It was 2005. Mark Zuckerberg had started what eventually became Facebook while attending Harvard, and a year later took up 60 million share options at 6 cents each. Last year the 28-year-old Facebook CEO, exercised his options - for a gain of nearly 2.3 billion, the company said in a late Friday proxy filing with the US Securities & Exchange Commission. Facebook 's Initial Public Offering last May was at 38 a share. It went to 45 but fell to 17.55 within weeks. Friday's close: 26.85. Zuckerberg also received 503,000 in salary last year, a 266,000 bonus, plus perks valued at 1.2 million, mostly for personal use of company aircraft. Zuckerberg's scooped up another 60 million shares when he took the social network public last year . According to CNN, the tax bill for that will be more than 1 billion. Zuckerberg should have \\"no trouble clearing his tax bill,\\" says USA Today. According to Forbes' billionaires list, he's worth 13.3 billion. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, gained nearly 2.3 billion in 2012 when he exercised 60 million stock options just before the company's initial public offering (IPO). This caused him to incur a massive tax bill, which he paid by selling 30.2 million Facebook shares for 38 each, raising 1.1 billion.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut 1978's More Songs About Buildings and Food brought about the band's long-term collaboration with producer Brian Eno, who had previously worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie, John Cale and Robert Fripp; the title of Eno's 1977 song \\"King's Lead Hat\\" is an anagram of the band's name. Eno's unusual style meshed well with the group's artistic sensibilities, and they began to explore an increasingly diverse range of musical directions, from post-punk to psychedelic funk to African music. This recording also established the band's long-term recording studio relationship with the famous Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. More Songs... cover of Al Green's \\"Take Me to the River\\" broke Talking Heads into general public consciousness and gave the band their first Billboard Top 30 hit. The Eno-Talking Heads experimentation continued with 1979's Fear of Music, which flirted with the darker stylings of post-punk rock, mixed with white funkadelia and subliminal references to the geopolitical instability of the late 1970s. Music journalist Simon Reynolds cited Fear of Music as representing the Eno-Talking Heads collaboration \\"at its most mutually fruitful and equitable\\". The single \\"Life During Wartime\\" produced the catchphrase \\"This ain't no party, this ain't no disco.\\" The song refers to the Mudd Club and CBGB, two popular New York nightclubs of the time. 1980's Remain in Light was heavily influenced by the afrobeat of Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti, whose music Eno had introduced to the band. It explored West African polyrhythms, weaving these together with Arabic music from North Africa, disco funk, and \\"found\\" voices. These combinations foreshadowed Byrne's later interest in world music. In order to perform these more complex arrangements, the band toured with an expanded group that included Adrian Belew and Bernie Worrell, among others, first at the Heatwave festival in August, and later in their concert film Stop Making Sense. During this period, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz also formed a commercially successful splinter group, Tom Tom Club, influenced by the foundational elements of hip hop, and Harrison released his first solo album, The Red and the Black. Likewise, Byrne--in collaboration with Eno--released My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, which incorporated world music and found sounds, as well as including a number of other prominent international and post-punk musicians. All were released by Sire. Remain in Light's lead single, \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", became a Top 20 hit in the UK, but initially failed to make an impression upon its release in the band's own country. But it grew into a popular standard over the next few years on the strength of its music video, which was named one of Time magazine's All-TIME Best Music Videos.

Which friend had less unused energy in food? Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","completion":"Paul, who ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs, had more unused energy in food. This is because he consistently consumed more food energy than he needed, which got stored in his body as fat, leading to his obesity. On the other hand, Mike followed a vegan diet and stayed healthy and thin, indicating that he likely had less unused energy in food. Obesity and related health problems are generally caused by consuming more energy than the body needs and can utilize, which was the case for Paul."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

His remarkably candid images of some of the most violent conflicts of the first half of the 20th century were unlike any seen in the world of photojournalism before and led to him being labelled the 'greatest war photographer in the world'. But Robert Capa is said to have hated the subject that he made his name shooting with his trusty 35mm camera. The photographer, who would have been 100 this week, was there when Allied troops stormed the beach at Omaha in 1944, and witnessed the brutal civil war that ripped apart Spain for much of the later 1930s. Iconic: Perhaps Robert Capa's most famous photograph - Death of a Loyalist Soldier - which was taken in Cordoba, Spain in 1936. Capa would have been 100 this week. Welcoming: This picture of civilians lining the streets of Monreale just outside Palermo, Italy, was taken in July 1943. Joint effort: In Paris in 1944 following the entry of the French 2nd Armored Division, numerous pockets of German snipers had to be rooted out - many civilians joined troops in the fighting. POW: A German soldier after he had been captured by American troops near Nicosia in July 1943. He was on hand to chronicle some of the most important moments in world history in the last century and his photos of the D Day landings in particular offer the most vivid depiction of the bloody but crucial invasion of France. Capa was born Andre Friedmann in Hungarian capital Budapest in 1913 but moved to Berlin when he was 17 enrolling in the Deutsche Hochschule Fur Politik where he studied journalism and political science while working part time in a dark room. He remained in Berlin until Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the rise of the Nazis gained pace, moving to Paris. Along with his companion Gerda Jaro, Capa made regular trips to Spain between 1936 and 1939 to photograph the Spanish Civil War. During that time he took arguably his most famous photograph - Death of a Loyalist Soldier - which graphically depicted the death of anarchist Federico Borrell García. Poignant: An American soldier pictured smiling and walking hand in hand with three British orphans who were adopted by his unit. Faithful companion: An American soldier pictured petting a puppy during the Second World War. Goodbye: Spanish soldiers bid farewell to their loved ones before the departure of a military train to the Aragon front. Musical: This picture was taken on a train between Memphis and Hot Springs in the U.S in 1940. He also travelled to China in 1938 to document resistance to the Japanese invasion there. The Picture Post described him as the 'greatest war photographer in the world' later the same year. Capa fled to America when the Second World War started and began working as a freelance photographer for LIFE, Time and several other publications. From 1941 until 1946, Capa was war correspondent for LIFE and Collier's and travelled with the U.S Army. He captured Allied victories in North Africa, the Normandy landings in 1944 and the capture of Leipzig, Nuremberg and Berlin. Famous face: Negatives showing Leon Trotsky lecturing in Copenhagen in November 1932. Funny men: Capa took this image of members of the Laurel and Hardy fan club in Paris in 1937. Famous subject: Writer Ernest Hemmingway pictured in Sun Valley, Idaho, in 1940. Following the war, he co-founded the Magnum photo agency before heading to Israel to capture the turmoil surrounding the country's declaration of independence between 1948 and 1950. Not just a war photographer, Capa also met and photographed the likes of Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemmingway and Leon Trotsky. The photographer became a casualty of war himself in 1954. Capa travelled to Hanoi to cover the French war in Indochina but was killed when he stepped on a landmine shortly after arriving. He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French and the Robert Capa Gold Medal Award for excellence in the field of photojournalism was established the year after his death. Robert Capa's 11 surviving close up photographs. of the Omaha beach landings on June 6 1944 earned the nickname the. 'Magnificent Eleven' but he had in fact taken 106 photographs while. wading through the water. The images were sent to Life. magazine's office in Britain where picture editor John Morris told staff. in the dark room to 'rush!' as they did the developing. In their haste, worker Dennis Banks. shut the doors on a wooden locker where the film was drying and 95 of. the images melted as the negatives were destroyed. Iconic: One of Capa's 11 surviving photos of Allied troops invading Normandy in June 1944. Three whole rolls were lost, and more. than half of the fourth.The useless film was tossed in a dustbin that. same night and lost forever. There were no other pictures taken. from so close to the frontline landings on D-Day so The Magnificent. Eleven provide the only enduring images from Normandy. He later wrote in his book, called. Slightly out of Focus: 'The men from my barge waded in the water. Waist-deep, with rifles ready to shoot, with the invasion obstacles and. the smoking beach in the background gangplank to take my first real. picture of the invasion. 'The boatswain, who was in an. understandable hurry to get the hell out of there, mistook my. picture-taking attitude for explicable hesitation, and helped me make up. my mind with a well-aimed kick in the rear. The water was cold, and the. beach still more than a hundred yards away.' He dived for cover behind a steel. object before heading onward in the water for a disabled American tank. as he snapped away furiously. The photographer held his camera high. above his head to stop his precious film being damaged and later ran. towards an incoming landing craft. He was hauled aboard and spirited. away to England where most of his shots were inadvertently destroyed in. the developing room.

Math Problem Solve -493*y - 31079 = 99*y + 143*y + 10081 for y.","completion":"To solve the given equation, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation The given equation is -493*y - 31079 = 99*y + 143*y + 10081. First, combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. 99*y and 143*y are like terms, as they both have the variable y. Add them together: 99*y + 143*y = (99 + 143)*y = 242*y Now the equation becomes: -493*y - 31079 = 242*y + 10081 Step 2: Isolate the variable y To do this, move the term with the variable y from the right side of the equation to the left side. Add 493*y to both sides of the equation: -493*y + 493*y - 31079 = 242*y + 493*y + 10081 This simplifies to: -31079 = 735*y + 10081 Now, move the constant term from the left side of the equation to the right side. To achieve this, subtract 10081 from both sides: -31079 - 10081 = 735*y + 10081 - 10081 -41160 = 735*y Step 3: Solve for y Now, to isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by 735: -41160 / 735 = 735*y / 735 -56 = y So the solution to the equation -493*y - 31079 = 99*y + 143*y + 10081 is y = -56."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. Question: What can we learn from Viry-Babel?

As Dallas Archer was being booked into the Kingsport jail, a female corrections officer alerted to an “unknown object” in the teenager’s crotch during a search. The jailer and a female cop then accompanied Archer to a bathroom for further examination, a review that led to the recovery of a “North American Arms 22 LR revolver (loaded) which Ms. Dallas had concealed in her vagina,” according to a Kingsport Police Department report first obtained by the Kingsport Times-News. A subsequent check revealed that the five-shot mini-revolver--which is four inches in length--had been “stolen from an auto burglary in 2013.” The handgun, which police valued at 250, is owned by a 70-year-old Kingsport man. In a TSG interview, John Souther said that the gun was taken from his 1994 Mustang, which was “ransacked” last year while parked in his Kingsport carport. Souther said that police told him that the revolver had been recovered, but offered no further details. When told where the gun had been stashed, Souther said, “Oh, gosh.” He noted that he would eventually like “the little fellow” returned, but added that the weapon would require “a bath in bleach.” Archer, seen in the above mug shot, was charged with gun possession and introducing contraband into a penal facility. According to a jail official, Archer was released from custody after posting 6000 bond. Something like this has, of course, happened before. And before.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which BEST explains why green marine algae are most often restricted to the top 100 meters of the ocean?","completion":"Green marine algae are most often restricted to the top 100 meters of the ocean due to several interrelated factors, primarily revolving around the availability of sunlight, the presence and diversity of essential nutrients, and water temperature. 1. Availability of sunlight: Green marine algae, like all photosynthetic organisms, require sunlight to carry out the process of photosynthesis - the process through which they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds and oxygen. In the ocean, sunlight penetration decreases with depth. The top 100 meters of the ocean is known as the euphotic zone or lighted zone, which is where a majority of sunlight penetrates and where photosynthesis can take place most efficiently. Below this zone lies the dysphotic (or twilight) zone, where sunlight penetration is minimal, and the aphotic zone, where it is nearly or entirely absent. 2. Essential nutrients: Nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, are vital for the growth and reproduction of marine algae. These necessary elements often follow a vertical distribution pattern in the ocean, with high concentrations near the surface and lower concentrations in the depths. The main reason for this pattern is that nutrient-rich surface waters receive inputs from the atmosphere, river runoffs, and coastal upwellings, while deeper waters are nutrient-depleted due to limited mixing and lower vertical circulation. The high availability of nutrients in the top 100 meters contributes to the thriving of green marine algae in this zone. 3. Water temperature: Green marine algae are sensitive to water temperature, with different species adapted to specific temperature ranges. In general, these organisms thrive in warmer waters found closer to the surface, where solar energy helps to maintain a relatively stable temperature throughout the year. As depth increases, water temperature drops, creating conditions that are less favorable for green marine algae growth. 4. Grazing pressures: The top 100 meters of the ocean houses a high concentration of zooplankton, small fish, and other primary consumers that feed on green marine algae. Predation on algae helps keep their population in check, maintaining ecosystem balance and preventing overgrowth. Populations below the top 100 meters would experience reduced grazing pressures, but the absence or minimal sunlight negates the advantage this might provide the algae. 5. Competition: Green marine algae face competition with other marine organisms, such as diatoms and cyanobacteria, in their natural environment. The top 100 meters offers an ecological niche where they have adapted to effectively compete for resources. Moving to greater depths would mean facing a different kind of competition, in which they would struggle to adapt and survive. In summary, the top 100 meters of the ocean provide the optimal conditions for green marine algae, making it their preferred habitat. The various factors mentioned above, such as sunlight availability, nutrient distribution, water temperature, grazing pressures, and ecological competition, play a significant role in restricting green marine algae to these shallow depths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

First -born children receive all the attention from their parents. Most families have twice as many photos of a first-born than any other child. Parents usually give first-born more responsibility and depend on them to take care of younger brothers and sisters. As a result, first -born are often responsible, hard-working, and jealous . They often want to do well at school and work. There are more first-born American Presidents, for example, George Bush, George Washington, and Lyndon Baines Johnson than second or last-born children. When a second child arrives, parents are more relaxed. The second child has to compete with the first-born for the parents' attention and love. Their children often choose different sports and hobbies to do well at school and work, but have to be creative to get their family's attention. They are often friendly and cool.

Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft.

Roger Price and his wife became involved in a bitter neighbourhood dispute over noise from a nearby playground which saw them sue the parish council for 'making their lives a misery'. The retired British Airways pilot told a district judge that shrieking children enjoying play facilities erected on a recreation ground next to his million pounds home in Ascot, Berkshire, had spoilt his enjoyment of the upmarket neighbourhood.

Angela was more thankful for the gift than Erin was because Pick from: [+] Angela had high expectations..

Though both friends had eagerly anticipated the gift, their personal experiences and reactions to it differed greatly, leading to a disparity in the amount of gratitude they each expressed. From the moment Angela had gotten wind of the impending gift, her excitement had known no bounds. She had been going through a rough patch, and the thought of receiving something special filled her with an inexplicable sense of joy and anticipation. Angela had spent countless nights lying awake, her mind swirling with the different possibilities of what the gift could be. Each potential item seemed more marvelous and extravagant than the last, driving her expectations higher and higher. Angela's high expectations stemmed not only from her current circumstances but also from her upbringing. Growing up, Angela's family had always placed great importance on meaningful gift-giving, equating such tokens with love and thoughtfulness. This emotional attachment to the concept of gifting resulted in Angela developing a strong appreciation for thoughtful and well-presented gifts. On the other hand, Erin had high expectations as well, but her outlook on the gift differed from Angela's. Though she too looked forward to the gift, Erin had a history of experiencing disappointments when it came to receiving gifts from others. Her past experiences had left her feeling let down on several occasions. This made her more cautious about getting her hopes up too high, so she tempered her enthusiasm with a heavier dose of realism to avoid possible heartache. Furthermore, Erin's upbringing contributed to her distinct perspective on gift-giving. In her family, material presents were not the primary way to express love and affection. Instead, Erin grew up valuing quality time and experiences shared with her loved ones over the exchange of physical items. Consequently, while she appreciated the thought behind the gift, she did not place as much emotional weight on it as Angela did. When the gift finally arrived, it was indeed a grand and beautiful token of love. Angela's eyes shone with gratitude as she carefully unveiled the gift. Every detail of its presentation, from the elaborate wrapping to the sweet scent wafting from within, surpassed her high expectations. Her heart swelled with happiness as she reveled in the feeling of being truly cared for. Erin, though she certainly valued the gift, could not help but compare it to her more grounded expectations. Her appreciation, while genuine, was muted by the subconscious thought that it was just one of many ways people could express their love, and that no material item could fully capture the depth and complexity of their relationships. In conclusion, Angela was more thankful for the gift than Erin was because Angela had high expectations that were surpassed by the reality of the gift. This, coupled with the significance she attached to gift-giving, led Angela to feel a deep sense of gratitude. On the other hand, Erin's tempered expectations, combined with her belief that gifts were not the most important expression of love, resulted in a more measured appreciation of the gift. Their contrasting upbringings and personal experiences shaped their perceptions of gift-giving, and ultimately cultivated different levels of gratitude within each friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inishnee is a small island off the shore of Ireland , in Roundstone Bay near the village of Roundstone in Connemara in County Galway . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, both sentences are paraphrases of each other. They convey the same meaning by providing the same information but using slightly different words, syntax, or structure. In both sentences, you can understand that Inishnee is a small island located off the coast of Ireland, situated in Roundstone Bay, near the village of Roundstone in Connemara, County Galway. Although the sentence structure varies slightly and contains some repetition, the meaning remains the same in both cases. A more rigorous comparative analysis of both sentences is as follows: 1. Inishnee is a small island off the coast of Ireland, in Roundstone Bay, near the village of Roundstone in Connemara in County Galway. 2. Inishnee is a small island off the shore of Ireland, in Roundstone Bay near the village of Roundstone in Connemara in County Galway. Here are the key differences: - In Sentence 1, the term \\"coast\\" is used, while Sentence 2 uses the term \\"shore.\\" However, both words refer to the land beside a body of water and can be used interchangeably in this context. - Both sentences provide the same location details for Inishnee, mentioning it is located in Roundstone Bay, near the village of Roundstone, in Connemara, County Galway. However, the placement of commas in Sentence 1 separates the details for better readability, while Sentence 2 omits the comma between \\"Roundstone Bay\\" and \\"near the village of Roundstone.\\" Despite these variations, both sentences are effectively communicating the same information and can be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not mean the same thing. They appear to be referring to similar events and relationships, but the information is presented differently, leading to a change in the meaning of each sentence. Let's break down each sentence to examine the differences: 1. \\"He has a son (born 2000) from a previous relationship with TV presenter Angela Gessmann. In July 2011, Lanz married Birgit Schrowange.\\" In this sentence, the following information is conveyed: - The subject of the sentence (presumably Markus Lanz) has a son born in 2000. - The son's mother is Angela Gessmann, a TV presenter. - Angela Gessmann was in a previous relationship with the subject, indicating that they are no longer together. - In July 2011, the subject married Birgit Schrowange, who is presented as a separate individual in this context. 2. \\"He has a son (born 2000) from a former relationship with TV presenter Birgit Schrowange, who married Angela Gessmann in July 2011.\\" In this sentence, the following information is conveyed: - The subject of the sentence (presumably Markus Lanz) has a son born in 2000. - The son's mother is Birgit Schrowange, a TV presenter. - Birgit Schrowange was in a former relationship with the subject, indicating that they are no longer together. - In July 2011, Birgit Schrowange married Angela Gessmann, suggesting that Angela Gessmann is now Birgit Schrowange's spouse. Based on the comparison, it is clear that the two sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence presents Angela Gessmann as the subject's former partner with whom he has a son, and Birgit Schrowange as the subject's current spouse. In contrast, the second sentence presents Birgit Schrowange as the subject's former partner with whom he has a son, and Angela Gessmann as Birgit Schrowange's current spouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Radnitz was the producer of the 1974 film adaptation of the novel by whom? Answer:","completion":"Robert B. Radnitz was the producer of the 1974 film adaptation of the novel \\"Where the Lilies Bloom\\" written by Bill and Vera Cleaver. The film, directed by William A. Graham, is a family drama that focuses on the story of four abandoned children living in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Their stories are an intimate portrayal of rural poverty, resilience, and self-sufficiency in the face of adversity. The Cleavers originally published \\"Where the Lilies Bloom\\" in 1969, receiving a warm response from both critics and readers. The novel went on to win numerous awards and accolades, including the \\"Horns\\" award, which recognizes exceptional contribution to children's literature. Critics praised the Cleavers for their ability to capture the authentic voice and resilience of their young characters, as well as the vivid depiction of the rural Appalachian setting. The film adaptation of \\"Where the Lilies Bloom\\" reflects these elements well, with a strong focus on the characters, their challenges, and the strength they derive from their family and community connections. Robert B. Radnitz chose a comparatively unknown cast to create a sense of authenticity. The young actors who played the four siblings were Julie Gholson (Mary Call), Helen Harmon (Devola), Jan Smithers (Ima Dean), and Matthew Burrill (Romey), all delivering compelling and heartfelt performances. The film's sincerity and emotional depth can be credited in part to Radnitz's production and his choice to closely adhere to the original source material. As a producer, Radnitz was known for his dedication to creating high-quality family films that both entertained and educated audiences. He had a long career producing films adapted from children's literature, such as \\"A Dog of Flanders\\" (1960), \\"Misty\\" (1961), \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" (1964), and \\"Sounder\\" (1972), the latter of which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. \\"Where the Lilies Bloom\\" is another successful example of Radnitz's work and his commitment to bringing powerful, engaging stories for young audiences to the silver screen. By adapting Bill and Vera Cleaver's novel, Radnitz allowed the book's themes of family and perseverance to resonate with movie-goers, creating a lasting legacy for the story and its characters that continues to inspire generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.

To correctly answer the question, one might talk about areas of the brain such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area that are primarily involved in language processing. One may also discuss how sentences are usually decoded in terms of their syntax and semantics, the roles of short-term memory and long-term memory in language comprehension, the process of language acquisition in children, and the brain's remarkable plasticity that allows language functions to be taken over by adjacent areas if certain regions were to be damaged due to stroke or injury.

(a). negative (b). positive Short movie review: it does n't take itself so deadly seriously Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, \\"it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously,\\" it seems like the critic is thinking positively (b) of the movie. The critic's statement highlights that the movie doesn't demand a high level of seriousness from both the creators and the viewers. Furthermore, the term \\"deadly seriously\\" is likely used to emphasize an overly dramatic or excessively somber approach that the movie avoids. This could be considered a positive comment because it suggests that the movie brings a lighter or more entertaining atmosphere, making the film potentially more enjoyable or engaging for its audience. The movie may maintain a sense of amusement, which allows the audience a chance to escape from the stress and complexities of daily life into a more thought-provoking, fresh, or simply fun cinematic experience. It also implies that the movie might not be weighed down by excessive intellectualism or heavy-handed themes. Instead, it either focuses on a more balanced approach, incorporating humor, action, adventure, or lighter drama, or it simply gives its audience an entertaining ride without demanding long-lasting moral or philosophical contemplation. In conclusion, the critic's perspective appears to be positive since their choice of words emphasizes a distinctive quality of the movie that avoids taking itself too seriously. This feature most likely added to an enjoyable viewing experience and contributed to an overall positive evaluation of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

How to address a senator Use \\" the honorable \\" on the envelope. \\" the honorable \\" is a title typically given to elected officials. When writing to a senator, start with the title and then type the senator's first and last name. Answer:","completion":"The most natural way to address a senator in a letter is to use their full title, including their middle initial if available. For example, if you were writing to Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, you would address the letter as \\"The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch.\\" This shows respect for the senator's position and acknowledges their role as an elected official. In the first paragraph of your letter, you should restate the senator's full title to address them formally. For instance, you could write, \\"Dear Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\\" as your opening salutation. This not only helps to set a respectful tone for your correspondence but also ensures that your letter is directed to the appropriate person. Using the senator's last name throughout the letter maintains a formal tone, so avoid using their first name unless you have a personal connection with the senator. If you wish to address the senator more uniquely, you could refer to them as \\"Senator John Smith, Senator,\\" for example. This approach highlights the senator's role while demonstrating respect for their position. When addressing an envelope to a senator, using the title \\"The Honorable\\" is appropriate, as it signifies the high level of respect accorded to elected officials. Combine this honorific with the senator's full name, like \\"The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch,\\" when writing the address on the envelope. In summary, when writing a letter to a senator, it is crucial to use their full title to demonstrate respect and acknowledge their role.

Q: Q: About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported where? A: A:","completion":"Approximately 20 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by cellular metabolism in the body is bound by hemoglobin, which is a crucial protein found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is responsible for the transportation of oxygen from our lungs to various tissues and organs, as well as the transportation of carbon dioxide from these tissues back to the lungs for elimination. The binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin forms what is known as carbaminohemoglobin. Carbon dioxide transportation by hemoglobin occurs primarily through the following processes: 1. Dissolution in plasma: Approximately 7 percent of carbon dioxide is dissolved directly in the bloodstream as plasma. This dissolved carbon dioxide is transported in the blood to the lungs, where it is then released and exhaled. 2. Bicarbonate formation: About 70 percent of carbon dioxide in the blood is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells and reacts with water, catalyzed by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase, to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This carbonic acid then dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). The bicarbonate ions are moved out of the red blood cells into plasma in exchange for chloride ions (Cl-) through a process known as the chloride shift, while hydrogen ions bind to hemoglobin, preventing a drop in pH. When the blood reaches the lungs, this process is reversed, and carbon dioxide is released for exhalation. 3. Carbaminohemoglobin formation: The remaining 20-23 percent of carbon dioxide binds directly with the amino groups in hemoglobin, producing carbaminohemoglobin. This process mainly occurs at the terminal amino groups of globin chains, including the alpha and beta chains within hemoglobin molecules. The binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is weak and reversible, allowing for the easy release of carbon dioxide when the blood reaches the lungs. At the same time, oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) releases its oxygen into the tissues. When blood rich in carbon dioxide reaches the lungs, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolar spaces of the lungs due to the exchange of gases between the alveoli and the bloodstream. This causes the dissociation of carbaminohemoglobin, alongside bicarbonate conversion and direct plasma-dissolved carbon dioxide release. As a consequence, the carbon dioxide can diffuse from the bloodstream to the alveolar spaces, where it is eventually exhaled. In summary, about 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and transported in the form of carbaminohemoglobin within the red blood cells. This process is essential for maintaining acid-base balance in the body and ensuring the effective delivery of oxygen to our tissues and organs while removing excess carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of cellular respiration. The carbon dioxide is ultimately transported to the lungs, where it is released and exhaled from the body in a continuous and efficient manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis was able to pronounce Irish names with ease, but Nelson had a hard time, because Gaelic was a foreign language for","completion":"both of them. However, Dennis had put in the effort to learn the nuances and quirks of Gaelic pronunciation through various resources, such as online language courses and informative videos, which greatly improved his comprehension and pronunciation abilities. On the other hand, Nelson's lack of exposure and practice in the language, coupled with his unfamiliarity with the intricacies of Gaelic phonetics, made it challenging for him to accurately pronounce those Irish names. As the two friends continued to engage in conversations involving Irish names and culture, Dennis took it upon himself to help Nelson overcome the language barrier. He would carefully break down the pronunciation of each syllable and guide Nelson through the unique sounds that were often absent in their native language. Simultaneously, Nelson began to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the Gaelic language, as he learned about its rich history and the significance it carries for the Irish people. Dennis suggested various methods for Nelson to improve his Gaelic pronunciation, such as listening to Irish music, watching Irish films, and following podcasts or YouTube channels dedicated to the language. Moreover, he encouraged Nelson to practice speaking Gaelic as much as possible, even if he was unsure about the proper pronunciation, because the more he interacted with the language, the more naturally it would flow. Over time, Nelson's grasp of Gaelic steadily improved. He began to recognize common patterns in the language, which enabled him to better anticipate the pronunciation of unfamiliar Irish names. Furthermore, he developed a finer ear for the distinct sounds and subtle inflections that characterized Gaelic, and his confidence grew as he became increasingly comfortable with speaking the language. As Nelson's proficiency in Gaelic continued to develop, it opened up new doors and opportunities for the two friends. They were able to connect more deeply with Irish culture by engaging in events, exploring literature, and even delving into the world of traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and Gaelic football. Along the way, their friendship also grew stronger, as they shared a mutual sense of accomplishment and discovery through their linguistic and cultural journey. In the end, Dennis and Nelson's pursuit of Gaelic mastery not only helped them overcome a linguistic obstacle but also enriched their lives by fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Irish heritage and tradition. Their diligence, dedication, and teamwork ultimately allowed them to bridge the gap between two distinct cultures, underscoring the power and beauty of language in connecting people and uniting communities."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer. It was a relatively humble selection by Trump, a former Paris runway model who is frequently clad for public appearances in haute couture dresses and coats. What does Trump think about the news media? - Trump loves them - Trump is caring toward them - not enough information - Trump can't stand them The answer is:","completion":"Trump can't stand them. President Donald Trump has often expressed his dislike for the news media, frequently referring to them as \\"Fake News Media\\" and accusing them of being dishonest. In this case, he tweeted that the message on Melania's jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" This statement demonstrates his negative stance towards the news media."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process of producing greenhouse gases, as described in the question, is the production of carbon dioxide by engines. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), and methane (CH4), trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change. To elaborate on this first step, internal combustion engines in vehicles, industrial equipment, and power stations burn fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, coal, and natural gas to generate energy. This burning process, also known as combustion, results in chemical reactions that produce various by-products, one of which is carbon dioxide. During combustion, the carbon atoms in the fuel react with oxygen atoms in the air, producing carbon dioxide gas, which is then released into the atmosphere as an exhaust emission. Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent greenhouse gas produced by human activities, and according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), transportation accounts for nearly 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with road transportation (passenger cars, trucks, buses, etc.) being the largest source within this sector. This first step, the production of carbon dioxide by engines, plays a significant role in the overall process of producing greenhouse gases, which in turn, contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect and poses a threat to global climate stability. To mitigate these emissions, there is a growing emphasis on the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, and improvements in fuel efficiency. Additionally, public policies and international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide to help alleviate the impacts of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The company's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and \\"Colonial\\" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise. Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; – in 1909, Louis Blériot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Blériot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Real-life Hunger Games in America LONDON — Back in The New York Times newsroom on a recent trip to New York, I came across some children’s literature. The slim pamphlets, in bright colors and featuring beloved cartoon characters, were about subjects like teeth brushing and healthy eating, and I immediately thought I had to pick them up for my kids. The little books were in an area where reporters and editors leave material they didn’t solicit. As you can imagine, we receive lots. Whoever had received the little booklets featuring the characters from Sesame Street, an American and now a global children’s television show broadcast in 140 countries, had put them unopened on the discard shelf for anyone to take. Since we had just started teeth-brushing with my 2-year-old twins and I didn’t think we were doing too well, I was ecstatic to see the Sesame Street tooth-brushing book. I grabbed the three other pamphlets on healthy eating, too. When I finally got around to opening the literature what I found shocked me. In the booklet entitled “Food for Thought: Eating Well on a Budget” there was a section called “Family Food Talk.” In it, the writer, Leslie Kimmelman, advised parents: “You may notice big brothers or sisters making sacrifices without being asked. They may choose to skip meals or encourage their younger sibling to eat less food. Reassure them by saying: ‘Our whole family needs to eat and keep our bodies strong. You need to eat, too.’ Offer ideas for positive ways they can help the family. Older children can help make a shopping list, plan menus, and prepare meals.” My happy feelings of having secured yet another learning opportunity for my boys dissolved into a heaviness I could feel in my chest and my stomach. In a section of the book called “Let’s Talk About It,” the writer suggested ways to answer your children’s questions: Why don’t we have enough food? It’s just the way things are right now. But I’m getting help and I’m working hard to make sure we get the food we need. Should I eat less so you can have some food? No, it’s important for you to eat and stay healthy. I’m finding ways to make our food last longer. If I need to, I will ask for more help. Will we have enough to eat? We don’t have a lot of money right now, but I love you and I’m doing everything I can to make sure we have food to eat. It was a cold dose of reality for me. I grew up poor and our family was sometimes on welfare and food stamps, but my own children’s experience was the polar opposite: they had more food than they could eat, and they ate a lot. Organic everything. French cheeses … in France. That Sesame Workshop, the non-profit educational organization behind Sesame Street, and their partners (UnitedHealthcare, an American health insurer, and Merck Company Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the drug giant) had created this literature meant that there was a need for it, a need so great that it had reached the corporate offices of these institutions. There were that many children going hungry in America. Last year Sesame Street aired a one-hour special about a character, Lily, who sometimes went to bed hungry. One of the other pamphlets I picked up featured Big Bird, arguably the most recognizable Sesame Street character (perhaps supplanted by Elmo for my children’s generation). In “A Delicious Day,” Big Bird visits his cousin Natalie and Granny Bird and they take a trip to a food pantry. “What’s a food pantry?” Big Bird asked. “I’ve never heard of that.” Natalie explained, “A food pantry is a place we go to when we need help getting food.” Clearly, “Food for Thought” is meant to help parents (as much as children) who are worried about poverty’s effect on their children’s psychology as well as nutrition. “A Delicious Day” seems to be aimed more at educating children about other children’s lives. Surely, having this literature is better than not having it. But wouldn’t it be better not to need it? Compared with other developed nations, the United States is an abysmal place to be needy, including for children. Almost 1 in 5 American children are at risk of suffering from hunger, according to the foundation of ConAgra Foods, the huge food company. Nearly a third of children in Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital, live in homes without “consistent access to food,” according to the foundation.

Summarize: Fill a glass full of cold water, then slowly drink it until it’s gone. As you drink, try to hold your breath for as long as you can. Additionally, you might plug up your ears. This technique works best if your water is ice cold rather than just chilled. Add water to a glass until it’s half full. Then, lean over your glass and drink from the side farthest away from you, which will simulate drinking upside down. As another option, you can lie upside down off of your bed or couch, then carefully drink the water. Stop every few sips to see if your hiccups have gone away. Be careful that you don’t accidentally breathe in the water or pour it into your nose. Take a spoon and fill it with white or brown sugar. Then, hold the spoon in your mouth for 5-10 seconds. Finally, swallow the sugar and take a big sip of water. If this doesn't work straight away, it's not a good idea to ingest spoonful after spoonful of sugar. Instead, switch to a different technique. Place a lemon wedge into your mouth. Then, either bite into the wedge and drink the juice, or suck on the wedge to get the juice. If the taste is too much for you, it’s okay to add a little sugar to the lemon wedge to sweeten it. The taste of the lemon juice causes a similar reaction to someone scaring you. Vinegar may help combat your hiccups, but you may find its smell and taste to be unpleasant. Since pickle juice contains vinegar, you can drink it instead. Take a few sips of pickle juice or put a few drops of it onto your tongue. Then, repeat as necessary until your hiccups are gone. All pickle juice contains vinegar, no matter the type of pickle. Scoop out a small spoonful of peanut butter, then place it onto your tongue. Hold it in place for 5-10 seconds to let it dissolve some. Then, swallow the peanut butter without chewing. Other nut butters like almond butter or Nutella can be substituted for the peanut butter, if you prefer.","completion":"The provided text offers various techniques to help get rid of hiccups, which involve drinking and eating different items.

He left the band on 13 December 1991 after becoming frustrated with the ever-increasing number of aborted studio sessions, having played essentially the same set of songs since 1986 and emerging as a songwriter in his own right. Power later commented that by that point he was more interested in his own songs \\"than anyone else's\\". Having switched from bass to rhythm guitar whilst residing at Brucklay House - a near derelict squat in Mossley Hill, where the seeds of legendary dance label 3 Beat Records were sown, Power began jamming with friends and with an ever-changing line-up began to form Cast. The first addition to the band was ex-Shack bassist Peter Wilkinson who had seen Power performing acoustically at a free festival in Liverpool, and who Power had seen around town.\\". Embryonic lineups of the band, featuring several guitarists including Ged Malley, ex-La's members Barry Sutton and Cammy and drummer Russell Brady started gigging in mid 1992 and supported the likes of Pele and The Stairs. Power would later state that he was never happy with these lineups. Unhappy with the band and the demos recorded with Who sound engineer Bob Pridden, he split the band up and extricated himself from his Go! Discs contract in Summer 1993, with whom he was still signed to following his departure from The La's and set about forming a new lineup with Wilkinson. The first new member to be recruited was Keith O'Neill who had previously played in The Empty Hours, The Windmills and Tommy Scott's pre-Space band The Australians and who Power had seen playing in local band The Windmills, fronted by Howie Payne later of The Stands and then guitarist Liam 'Skin' Tyson, who Wilkinson knew from college and had previously played in Pyramid Dream. When approached to join the band, Tyson initially declined as he had sold all of his musical equipment to teach canoeing at an outdoor centre in Alston in Cumbria. Tyson, who witnessed one of the band's early London shows and commented that \\"John had these songs, but not the band\\", joined the band in November 1993 and the new lineup played their first gig in Hull in January 1994.

Road police station requesting them to restrict the sister from making deliberate attempts to spoil Ms. Ahmed’s health. In their complaint, Saifee Hospital’s chief security officer Rakesh Singh alleged that Ms. Selim has been forcefully attempting to feed the patient through the mouth even when she is at the risk of aspirating food into the airway. Minister visits hospital On Thursday, Health Minister Deepak Sawant visited the hospital to get the real picture. “I saw her reports and met her. I don’t think the doctors have left any scope of complaints,” said Dr. Sawant, adding that the ongoing spar has put doctors in the bad light. “I wanted to see the reality with my own eyes and I feel very disappointed by whatever the patient’s relative has done,” he said. He added that he had conveyed his thoughts to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who had facilitated visas for Ms. Ahmed and her sister so that she could be brought to Mumbai for a bariatric surgery. Ms. Swaraj also took updates on Ms. Ahmed’s health from Dr. Mufazzal Lakdawala and hospital COO Huzaifa Sehabi. Inspiration to millions Ms. Ahmed weighed 500 kg before she was started on treatment by Dr. Lakdawala and his team. She now weighs 176 kg. A statement issued by the doctor on Thursday said, “As the treatment here concludes she is being shifted to Burjeel Hospital (a hospital initially introduced to the family by Dr. Lakdawala) in U.A.E . Secondary physiotherapy will continue over there as it is closer to home for Ms. Ahmed and her family. Ms. Ahmed is an inspiration to millions of critical and obese patients world over that someone as serious as she can get better with expert medical care and advances in medical science.” Dr. Shamsheer Vayalil, managing director of VPS Healthcare that runs Burjeel Hospital, visited her early on Thursday. Ms. Selim said, “I don’t know how much time they will take to shift her. Probably, two more days.” She said no one told her that she is not supposed to feed water to her sister. “I gave her water with wet cotton. What is the problem with that? If there is a problem, no one told me that.” “I am extremely scared now. I am taking care of my sister all alone. These people called the police for such a small issue,” she said, adding Dr. Lakdawala told her that he gave a piece of chocolate a few days ago. “So why would I think that water is not allowed to her?” Hospital unaffected Mr. Sehabi said the entire episode has not affected the functioning of the hospital. “We are carrying out our regular work. We are seeing our patients the same way. All this has not affected us,” he said, adding that the Saifee doctors have managed the most crucial part of her treatment. “Now there is only physiotherapy for her. We were anyway in the process of arranging someone to visit her home in Alexandria before she sent out the video.” Early this week, Ms. Selim had circulated a video stating that her sister’s condition is bad and that everything was done for propaganda. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

Ms. Eman Ahmed who currently weighs 340 kgs. has been under the care of a team of super specialists at Saifee Hospital lead by Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala. A high-risk patient with myriad medical conditions, she has recently successfully undergone a Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery at Saifee Hospital. This special gene study for the 91 different types of genes isolated with obesity related syndrome has been carried out gratis on Ms. Eman Ahmed, by CORE Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd. details of which are being shared in view of public interest in the case. The gene identified as the cause of Obesity in Ms Eman Ahmed is a homozygous missense variant c.1055G>A, p.(Cys352Tyr) in the LEPR gene. This variant has been previously detected in one individual in research setting by Personalized Diabetes Medicine Program, University of Maryland School of Medicine, and has been classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). However, in Eman’s case this has assumed pathologic consequences leading to her obesity. Ms. Eman Ahmed happens to be the only one in the world with this gene defect causing obesity. She also has another gene defect SDCCAG8 associated with PHENOTYPE Bardet‐Biedl syndrome, Senior‐ Loken syndrome but we believe that it may not be as significant the cause of obesity in her case as the LEPR Gene. Leptin receptor is involved in the regulation of body weight. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body, including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, mood, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an autosomal recessive disorder causing obesity and pituitary dysfunction. Leptin receptor deficiency caused by the LEPR gene mutations leads to a disorder, which is associated with excessive hunger, massive weight gain, and reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Mutations result in less receptor protein getting to the cell surface where leptin binding takes place. The receptors that get to the cell surface may bind to leptin, but their signalling function is impaired. The resulting shortage of leptin signalling disrupts normal feelings of hunger and satiety. In a collective statement the Team of Doctors, treating Ms. Eman Ahmed at Saifee Hospital lead by Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala, said “ There is a hormone called leptin which comes from fat tissue and tells the brain when fat stores are being depleted. In this unfortunate person, the docking station in the brain that leptin plugs into seems to be very defective so leptin doesn’t send its signal. Because of this. from early life., this patient’s brain has perceived that she is constantly starving. That has led her to constantly seek food, store it avidly in her body as fat and conserve energy. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific treatment for this condition. The operation that she has had may have some beneficial effects but does not deal with the underlying problem. New drugs are being developed which may be able, at least partially, to \\"bypass” the signalling block in the brain may have some promise in this situation but it is very early days for these drugs. So if she has access to these drugs and they are effective then we have a solution for her obesity. If not, then she may need a more radical surgery which causes malabsorption a little later in life.” The Doctors consulted for these studies were: Dr. David Cummings, M.D. Professor of Medicine Senior Investigator, Diabetes & Obesity Centre of Excellence University of Washington .

Ms. Eman Ahmed is considered to be the heaviest living woman in the world. The doctors submitted their letters to the Saifee Hospital authorities on Tuesday, stating that Shaaima Selim’s backlash is the worst kind of assault that a patient’s family can do to a doctor. “We will not see her on a daily basis and only go when the patient needs us. Whatever has happened is extremely disappointing,” said bariatric surgeon Dr. Aparna Govil Bhasker, who is one of the doctors in Dr. Mufazzal Lakdawala’s team. “The allegations have stemmed out of the fact that Ms. Selim doesn’t want to take her sister home.” To Ms. Selim’s allegations that doctors are not taking proper care, Dr. Bhasker said she even came on holidays to attend to Ms. Eman Ahmed. “It is very hurtful when she claims that the doctors have not been seeing her.” On Tuesday morning, Ms. Eman Ahmed was finally put into a CT scan machine. Doctors claimed that she weighed 171 kg and therefore could get into the machine that has a capacity of 204 kg. The scan report revealed that she did not have fresh brain ailment. “The scan suggested an old vascular insult in the left middle cerebral territory of her brain. There is no appreciable area of fresh infarct or intracranial haemorrhage,” said Dr. Rajiv Mehta, chief consultant and head of imaging sciences at Saifee Hospital, in a statement. ‘My sister will die’ Ms. Selim claimed that her sister is not in a condition to leave Mumbai. “The doctors want to send her back. But her condition is not good at all. The claims of her weight loss are false and just for the media,” she said, adding that Dr. Lakdawala had said that Ms. Eman Ahmed may lose 50 kg in a year after the surgery. “Now suddenly, he claims that she had lost 300 kg. It is not possible. My sister will die.” The hospital authorities, however, felt that her backlash began after Ms. Eman Ahmed was shifted to the main hospital building’s seventh floor from the specially-constructed ward. Ms. Selim also had a fully-equipped room next to her sister’s. Doctors said shifting her was possible only because she can now fit in a regular bed and also that she could be closer to physiotherapy and occupational therapy rooms. On Tuesday, Egyptian consul general Ahmed Khalil had a meeting with the doctors and Ms. Selim, but could not pacify her. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Step 2: Evaluating the possible answers Option 1: Be happy about it Given the context, it seems unlikely that Kai would be happy about this situation. The permanent separation and the fact that Kai looks back to Alex suggests that there's some form of attachment, which does not align with being happy about the situation.

Here is an article: Were the future of one of our brighter politicians not at stake, you'd have to laugh. Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, is in the soup because he shared a hotel bedroom with another chap. The very thought of him wriggling into his pajamas in full view of a man? Yikes! Modern Britain, nation of curtain-twitchers, lethally prurient, a country obsessed with hanky-panky, tuts and clucks and wonders if Mr. Hague is having a hot, steamy \\"pash\\" with the fellow. \\"Pash\\"? Passionate affair, my dears. The room in question was in fact a twin. You know: two beds, invariably separated by a table/telephone/in-built radio that doesn't work. If those obstacles don't cool your ardor, the prominent copy of the Gideon's Bible normally does. Although having been married for 14 happy years, I often find twin bedrooms rather a relief. They offer a chance of a decent night's kip without the wife pinching all the bedclothes. But back to Hague, 49, one of the most important figures in the new Coalition Government. He used to lead the Conservative party. He is one of the few top ministers to have served in the Cabinet before. He has also made a strong start to his time as foreign secretary, in which role he has frequent meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Hague's bedroom partner on the night in question was one of his aides, 25 year-old Christopher Myers. They were on the general election campaign at the time. Hague is a Yorkshireman and Yorkshiremen have, let us say, a certain reputation for parsimony. Tight as dead clams, in other words. But why not? What is wrong with looking after the pennies? A twin room makes economic sense. Given that Hague's Tories are forever lecturing the rest of us about reducing the national deficit, why not try to save a few pounds by sharing a twin bedroom for the night rather than splashing out on two singles? And so the deed was done. But not THAT deed, please! Christopher Myers is handsome lad. Slim. Luscious dark hair. Quite unlike his employer, who is as bald as a billiard ball. Myers' name confused me at first. I mistook it for Sir Christopher Meyer, former British ambassador to Washington, D.C. The thought of sybaritic Sir Christopher sharing a bedroom with the cost-conscious Hague was too delicious for words, but was no more than an erroneous illusion. The story of Hague and the youthful Myers sleeping in the same room was reported by a political blog, Guido Fawkes. There are sober blogs and there are mischievous blogs, and the pseudonymous Guido belongs to the latter. Scandal, gossip, intrigue--these are his specialties, with no quarter given to political correctness. Guido gave the tale plenty of welly and innuendo, and soon it was picked up by national newspapers. They illustrated it with a photograph of Myers and Hague walking down the street, the older man looking a proper idiot in trendy clothes and baseball cap.

The latest government report shows that their share of non-farm jobs nearly reached fifty percent in September, 2009. The job market continues to suffer the effects of last year's financial crash. On the one hand more women have entered the labor market over the years, and on the other hand the economic recession has hit men harder than women. In October the unemployment rate for men was almost 11% compared to 8% for women. Industries that traditionally use lots of men have suffered deep cuts. For example, manufacturing and building lost more jobs last month. But health care and temporary employment services have had job growth. Both of those industries employ high percentages of women. Thirty years ago, women earned sixty-two cents for every dollar that men earned. Now, for those who usually work full time, women earn about eighty percent of what men earn. And a recent study from the University of California, Davis, reveals that women hold fifty-one percent of well-paid management and professional jobs. Yet the study also shows that men still hold about nine out of every ten top positions at most companies. The results have remained largely unchanged for five years. Also, a new research paper in the journalSex Roleslooks at the experiences of women who are the main earners in their families. Rebecca Meisenbach at the University of Missouri in Columbia interviewed fifteen women. She found that they all value their independence and many enjoy having the power of control, though not all want it. But they even feel more pressure and worry. That is partly because of cultural expectations that working women should still take care of the children. Also, men who are not the main earners may feel threatened. Which of the following is a reason why women have a larger share of jobs? A) Women workers are paid less than men. B) More women now have higher education than men. C) The economic recession has affected men more than women. D) Industries that traditionally use lots of men now need more women. The answer is:","completion":"C) The economic recession has affected men more than women."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: Where can a television be stored and hidden? Options: A. apartment B. living room C. bedroom D. kitchen E. cabinet Answer:","completion":"E. Cabinet A television can be stored and hidden effectively in a cabinet. While televisions can indeed be placed in various rooms, such as an apartment, living room, bedroom, or kitchen, these options do not address the aspect of hiding the television when not in use or for specific design purposes. Cabinets, on the other hand, offer multiple advantages while storing and hiding a television. 1. Aesthetic appeal: Cabinets come in various sizes, styles, and materials, which allows homeowners to select one that complements their existing décor and design preferences. By storing a television in a cabinet, you can maintain a clean and organized appearance in the room when the television is not in use. 2. Protection: Cabinets provide protection from dust, accidental spills, and even potential damage due to impact. By keeping the television inside a closed cabinet, the screen and other sensitive components are shielded from external harm. 3. Space-saving: Many cabinets designed for televisions come with built-in storage options like shelves and drawers, which can be used to store additional electronic devices, cables, remote controls, and other related items. This helps declutter the area and make better use of space in the room. 4. Concealment: Cabinets with doors can easily hide the television from plain sight when not in use, giving the room a more formal and streamlined look. It is an ideal solution for homeowners who prefer not to display their television as a focal point in the room and instead wish to showcase other design elements or artwork. 5. Versatility: There are various cabinet styles available in the market to accommodate televisions, ranging from traditional armoires to modern media units with sliding doors or lift mechanisms. Based on individual preferences, homeowners can select a cabinet that best suits their needs and desired level of concealment or accessibility. In conclusion, storing a television in a cabinet not only adheres to common sense but also offers several benefits such as aesthetic appeal, protection, space-saving, concealment, and versatility. The other options mentioned (apartment, living room, bedroom, and kitchen) are locations where a television can be situated, but they do not effectively address the aspect of storing and hiding the television as a cabinet does."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Russian authorities demand a further 1.2bn in back-taxes from stricken oil firm Yukos, the Interfax news agency reports.","completion":"You are referring to a notable event in the early 2000s involving the Russian government and the then oil giant, Yukos Oil Company. Yukos was one of Russia's largest and most successful oil companies, established in 1993 following the privatization phase of state-owned industries in post-Soviet Russia. By the early 2000s, it had become Russia's largest oil producer. In 2003, however, the Russian government accused Yukos and its CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, of fraud and tax evasion. Khodorkovsky was arrested and eventually convicted. The Russian government's charges led to a series of actions meant to dismantle Yukos, which included imposing a series of hefty taxes and penalties on the company. In the context of your statement, it refers to a period when Russian authorities increased their tax demands from Yukos. The Russian authorities claimed that Yukos had not been paying the correct amount of taxes, using complicated internal deals to reduce its tax liability. They demanded a further 1.2 billion in back-taxes in addition to previous demands, as reported by Interfax news agency. This move significantly increased the financial strain on Yukos. Despite its efforts to pay off these tax obligations, the magnitude of the sums involved led to Yukos being declared insolvent in 2006. This sparked a controversial series of events leading to the de facto nationalization of Yukos's assets with many ending up in the hands of state-owned Rosneft. Over the years, the dismantling of Yukos has been interpreted in various ways. Supporters of Khodorkovsky and Yukos argue that this was politically motivated, as Khodorkovsky had started funding opposition parties and openly criticized President Vladimir Putin's administration. Others argue that this was a necessary move by the Russian state to retake control over strategic assets and fight against 'oligarchic' capitalism. In essence, the statement you mentioned is about one of the steps taken by the Russian authorities in their legal and financial battle against Yukos which ultimately led to the company's downfall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His birth name is widely perceived to be Fred Phillips, although on different documents, he is also credited as Fred Demaree or Stewart, while his biological parents were Luther and Olive Phillips (the latter of which was also credited under the Demaree and Stewart surnames). He was adopted, and at the time of his adoption (arranged by the Tennessee Children's Home Society), his father, a physician, was completing a residency in Detroit. Shortly afterward, the family settled in Edina, Minnesota, where the young Fliehr lived throughout his childhood and after ninth grade he attended Wayland Academy, a coeducational boarding school in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, for four years (five years total in high school), during which time he participated in interscholastic wrestling, football and track. Context: On March 31, 2012, while still contracted to TNA, Flair became the first person to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice, the second time as part of the class of 2012 with The Four Horsemen. On December 17, 2012, Flair returned to WWE as a non-wrestling personality on the annual Slammy Awards show to present the Superstar of the Year award to John Cena, who in turn gave the award to Flair. Flair's return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, escalating into a confrontation that ended with him locking Heyman in the figure-four leglock. After clearing the ring, Flair was assaulted by The Shield, until Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) helped Flair fend off the group. Flair appeared on the main roster sporadically throughout 2013, as The Miz's mentor. He also occasionally appeared on NXT in 2013 and 2014, accompanying his daughter Charlotte to the ring. Flair appeared on the April 28, 2014, episode of Raw, alongside the reunited Evolution (minus Flair) and The Shield; Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, Evolution's opponents at Extreme Rules, effectively turning his back on his old teammates. On July 14, John Cena symbolically handed over his World Heavyweight Championship belt to Flair, telling him to \\"take it\\" while promoting his match at Battleground. On the post-SummerSlam Raw in August 2015, Flair interrupted Jon Stewart, who had saved Flair's 16 world title record by preventing Cena's victory the previous night, telling him that the record would be broken eventually and he would rather it would be by someone who he respects. Flair began making more frequent appearances with Charlotte after she won the Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte's Divas Championship and later WWE Women's Championship defenses. This lasted until the May 23, 2016 episode of Raw, when Charlotte turned on him. On the November 28, 2016 episode of Raw, Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title. On the November 14, 2017 edition of SmackDown, Flair returned to congratulate his daughter, after she won the SmackDown Women's title from Natalya, incidentally in Charlotte's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, this being his first appearance for WWE since nearly dying earlier in the year. Question: Has he done anything else since?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Ric Flair has been involved in various activities since his appearances in WWE in 2017. Here are some of the things he has done: 1. ESPN Documentary: On November 7, 2017, ESPN released a documentary on the life and career of Ric Flair, titled \\"Nature Boy,\\" as part of their 30 for 30 series. The documentary featured interviews with fellow wrestlers, family members, and Flair himself, providing an in-depth look at his journey in the wrestling industry. 2. Public appearances and autograph signings: As a wrestling legend, Flair has continued to make appearances at various wrestling conventions, fan events, and autograph signings worldwide. These events serve as opportunities for fans to meet and interact with the iconic wrestler. 3. Podcast: Ric Flair hosted his podcast, \\"WOOOOO! Nation,\\" from May 6, 2015, until it went on hiatus in July 2016. The podcast featured interviews with wrestling personalities and discussions about the professional wrestling industry. In 2018, Flair started a new podcast, \\"The Ric Flair Show,\\" where he continued to talk about wrestling events, shared stories from his career, and interviewed guests from the wrestling world. 4. WWE Network Special: In 2019, WWE Network aired a special titled \\"Ric Flair: The Final Farewell,\\" a documentary that chronicled Flair's legendary career and his impact on the wrestling industry. The program featured interviews with several wrestling superstars who discussed Flair's influence on their careers. 5. Managerial role: Ric Flair has continued to make sporadic appearances on WWE programming, often accompanying his daughter Charlotte Flair during her matches and serving as a mentor to her. He has also occasionally been involved in storylines and segments involving other WWE superstars. 6. Endorsements and partnerships: Flair has been involved in endorsements and partnerships outside the wrestling ring. In 2020, he starred in a series of commercials for the National Car Rental company. He has also endorsed various products and brands in the past. In summary, Ric Flair has remained active in the wrestling industry and beyond since his WWE appearances in 2017. He has participated in documentaries, podcasts, and continued working with WWE in various capacities.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. I am facing a new situation today: Brad and Henry were two old friends in their 70's. Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it can be inferred that Brad, the friend with high levels of cholesterol, is the one most likely to be taking a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This drug is a statin, which helps lower cholesterol levels by increasing the levels of LDL-receptors in the liver, promoting the catabolism of plasma LDL, and ultimately removing cholesterol from the plasma. This process reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, a condition closely associated with high cholesterol levels. It is essential to note that the effectiveness of statin drugs may vary among individuals due to differences in genetic backgrounds and single nucleotide polymorphisms. As a result, Brad may respond differently to a particular statin compared to others with high cholesterol. In his case, trying different types of statins or combinations might help determine the most suitable drug to manage his cholesterol levels effectively. On the other hand, Henry's normal cholesterol levels indicate that he may not need to take a statin drug for cholesterol management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: In 2002, the Jubilee Relay was held before the Manchester Games. The baton visited 23 nations and travelled over 63,000 miles (101,000km) before it reached the UK and was carried by 5,000 runners. As this year's relay for the Glasgow Games arrives in Manchester, four people who took part in 2002 reflect on what it meant to be a baton-bearer. The image of Kirsty Howard and footballer David Beckham handing the baton to the Queen at Manchester's opening ceremony is one of the most memorable moments in Commonwealth Games history. Kirsty was born in 1995 with her heart back to front. Aged four, she was told she had just weeks to live. She defied the odds and, breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank, she joined Beckham on the pitch for an England World Cup qualifier against Greece in 2001. Months later, pictures of the six-year-old and the Manchester United captain passing the baton to Her Majesty were beamed around the world. \\"I didn't know that David was going to be there,\\" she recalls. \\"I was just standing there waiting and he came round the corner. He just gave me a hug and we went towards the Queen. \\"The Queen smiled at me. \\"The reaction from friends and family was amazing. I felt honoured to be there and everyone that I know was very proud. \\"It still feels an honour to have been part of it.\\" After achieving 12 GCSEs and raising about Â£7m for charity, Kirsty is now studying childcare at Manchester College with hopes of one day becoming a teacher. A Falklands War hero and charity fundraiser, Simon Weston is no stranger to public life. When he was asked to take part in the Queen's Baton Relay in 2002, he had no hesitation in saying yes as he \\"thought it would be fun\\". Weston ran in his native Wales and his memories of the event were as much about the attire as the relay itself. He said: \\"There was such a furore going on about the Manchester Games and I thought it would be lovely to take part in it. \\"You don't get to keep the baton. You have to hand it on to somebody else. It is not like the Olympics where everyone gets a torch if you want to buy it,\\" he added. \\"There were a lot of people who were slightly nervous. They had never done anything in the public eye before. \\"I was just treating it as a bit of fun, which it was. It was a good laugh,\\" he said. \\"The weirdest thing about it was the fact that I had to turn up wearing the most hideous tracksuit. It looked like I had been sitting next to an explosion in a paint factory. It provided my family and friends with great mirth.\\" Many people who took part in the 2002 relay were supported by the communities in which they lived. Elizabeth Heathcote was chosen by the Woman's Institute (WI) in Rutland after successfully recovering from a stroke 18 months earlier. Now 67, she reflected: \\"We were supported by lots of WIs. They decided it was nice that I had fully recovered and they asked me if I would represent them. \\"It was a great honour and over so quickly.\\" Elizabeth also has memories of the uniform worn by the baton-bearers. \\"It was a very bright outfit. They could see us all coming,\\" she joked. \\"It was something very different, something that I will probably never do again. I have done a few things in the WI but I think that was one of the highlights. \\"It is all part of life's sweet tapestry.\\" Claire Hewitt, who in 2002 was a 30-year-old living in the Tooting, south London, was nominated in secret by her neighbour Ian Fenn. \\"I got a parcel through the post. It said: 'Congratulations, you are going to be a baton relay runner. Here is your outfit.' \\"I had no idea what was going on at all.\\" Claire was put forward for welcoming Ian to the area. She now lives with her family in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and co-owns a software development company. Claire, like other runners, ran 500 yards (457m) with the 2002 baton. One of the distinctive features of that baton was an LED sensor that detected the pulse of the person who held it. She added: \\"I am not one of life's sporty people. I remember thinking: 'God, can I even run that far.' \\"I went out for a little test-run in a park in Windsor to check I could. It had a light inside that kept pulse with your heartbeat. \\"It is obviously quite exciting and a bit surreal. I am sure there are people who are far worthier than me. It was one of life's experiences - one to tell the grandchildren about. \\"I have kids now, and I think they would be interested to see my uniform in the loft.\\" The Queen's Baton Relay has been the traditional curtain-raiser for the Commonwealth Games since 1958. Every baton is different, and this year's relay began last October in London. It has travelled around the Commonwealth and has been held by thousands of children and athletes who will compete in Glasgow later this summer. Since the baton arrived back on the British Isles earlier this month in the hands of Olympic medallist Tom Daley, it has toured the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Wales. It will travel around England from Saturday until 13 June before it spends 40 days in Scotland. Just like it did in 2002, it will then play a key role in the opening ceremony of the Games. The BBC will be across the relay with rolling live video online every day when the baton is in Scotland.","completion":"In 2002, the Jubilee Relay, held before the Manchester Games, saw the baton travel over 63,000 miles and visit 23 nations before reaching the UK.

The answer is:","completion":"Stephen Gammell illustrated the series of children's books written by Alvin Schwartz, which were known as \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.\\" These books are considered to be the successors to the \\"Tales for the Midnight Hour\\" series, as they both share the common theme of presenting eerie and spine-chilling stories aimed at younger audiences. \\"Tales for the Midnight Hour\\" was first published in 1977 by author J.B. Stamper, and it marked the beginning of the popular horror anthology trend for children and young adults. It was composed of short, spine-chilling horror stories that were meant to be read aloud at sleepovers or during late-night storytelling sessions. This collection managed to captivate the imaginations of many young readers and has now become a classic in the genre of children's horror. Influenced by this approach, Alvin Schwartz's \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" series took these elements to the next level. The three books in this series - \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" (1981), \\"More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" (1984), and \\"Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill Your Bones\\" (1991) - contain a mix of horror, folklore, and urban legends crafted to terrify and entertain children. The collaboration with illustrator Stephen Gammell played a significant role in the success of the \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" series. Gammell's artwork was highly acclaimed for its extremely unsettling and haunting imagery, which often included distorted and grotesque figures that seemed to blur the line between reality and nightmare. His illustrations greatly enhanced the impact of Schwartz's tales, making them a memorable and influential part of young horror literature. Even today, both \\"Tales for the Midnight Hour\\" and Schwartz's \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" series evoke a sense of nostalgia among those who grew up with these tales. They represent a significant aspect of children's horror literature that has not only influenced many contemporary works but also shaped the childhood memories of countless readers. The collaboration between Alvin Schwartz and illustrator Stephen Gammell, in particular, remains an essential milestone in the development of this genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the past 12 years, Deutchman has visited Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta twice a week to hold and comfort babies in the neonatal intensive care unit—earning him the nickname “ICU Grandpa” from staff and parents. Even if he gets vomited on occasionally, the 82-year-old says the experience has been nothing short of rewarding. “It is very gratifying, not just because the babies are crying and you help them to stop crying,” Deutchman, from Atlanta, Georgia, tells PEOPLE. “There are a lot of benefits to that warm connection of being held—when a baby puts their face against your heartbeat, there’s a benefit there. I came to love it, but not just because of the connection with the babies, but the whole atmosphere of the hospital.” Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Deutchman retired from international business marketing about 15 years ago and spent some of his newfound free time giving lectures at local universities. But it wasn’t enough for him, and he wound up walking into Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta to ask if they had any volunteering opportunities available. He helped for a year in the hospital’s pediatric intensive care unit, and was soon asked to help in the NICU. “Before you know it, I was holding little babies,” he says while laughing. “And 12 years have just flown by.” Deutchman, who is married and has two daughters in their 50s and two grandkids, doesn’t just help the little ones, but makes sure worried mothers have a shoulder to lean on when they need it, as well. “I talk with mothers and sometimes I hold their hand, because holding a mom’s hand is just as important as holding a baby,” he says. “There’s a lot of stress for these parents. Having somebody tell them they can go get breakfast and assure them I’ll be there with their baby, it means something to them. It’s important.” Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Deutchman makes his visits to see babies and parents on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and says that though he doesn’t know what will await him behind hospitals doors, he’ll do his best to find a way to offer compassion and warmth to those who need it. “When I drive into that parking lot every other day, I never know what I’m going to see, who I’m going to be meeting, or what challenge will be in front of me,” he says. “It keeps changing, but if there’s anything I can do to make sure people are taken care of, that’s what I’m going to do.” ||||| ... put a new spin on that trend—with an inspirational twist.

Though staff and parents say he's a 'treasure', David Deutchman believes no one gets more out of it than he does. USA TODAY David Deutchman, 'ICU Grandpa', holds a premature baby at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. (Photo: Courtesy MaryBeth Brulotte) ATLANTA — Sometimes, babies need a little extra love when their life first begins. Maybe they came a little earlier than expected, or their bones need a little extra time to heal. Whatever the case may be, \\"ICU Grandpa\\" is there to provide some much-needed TLC. David Deutchman has been a volunteer with Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta for more than 12 years. After retiring from a career in international business, he says he found himself in the NICU and PICU units of the hospital. “It’s been wonderful because it gives me something to do that has meaning to it,” Deutchman says. He doesn’t do it for the fame or recognition; only recently did the world learn his identity when a photo of him holding a preemie went viral. “We live two hours from Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and seeing him all snuggled up when I got there was such a blessing,” says MaryBeth Brulotte, a mother of a premature baby. “Knowing this man is so selfless and donates his time to these babies is such a blessing.” There is no way to count exactly how many babies Deutchman has held over the years, but his quality time with them surely has made an impact. “It definitely helps,” says Elizabeth Mittiga, a Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta NICU Nurse. “Just feeling that comfort, that warmth. It definitely helps them to, I think, grow faster and put more weight on.” Deutchman says although the babies seem to enjoy their time with him, he gets much more out of it than they do. He says it’s something a few of his friends don’t understand. “They just don’t get it. The kind of reward you can get from holding a baby like this.” 'ICU Grandpa' sings 'You Are My Sunshine' to a baby at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. (Photo: Courtesy Children's Healthcare of Atlanta) Nurses say he’s a treasure. “He’s a really special person,” Mittiga says. “We’re so grateful for him to be a part of our unit and be a baby buddy.” Deutchman has two daughters in their 50s and two grandchildren, ages 19 and 21.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite bad(though the new \\"setting traps\\" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). It's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10","completion":"The sentiment of the review can be described as mostly negative with some mixed feelings. The reviewer points out several aspects that contribute to the negative sentiment, including: 1. Lack of originality: The reviewer feels that the movie is repetitive and not much different from the previous films in the series, despite trying to be original to some degree. 2. Disappointing score: The new score is considered quite bad, especially when compared to the first two films, although there's a mention of an interesting and different piece when setting traps. 3. Mediocre plot and acting: The plot is described as fair but still comparable to the previous films, while pointing out worse acting and a less impressive example of a 'scary character turning out to be good'. 4. Unimpressive characters: The characters are mostly caricatures, and the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones, with some tasteless jokes and an unnecessarily complex mission that might not be suitable for a children's film. 5. Weak attempts at improvement: The reviewer feels that the additional traps and characters do not significantly improve the movie. 6. Lack of personality in the sibling characters: There is a missed opportunity to develop the sibling characters, as they end up having less personality than the ones in the first two films. However, there are some slightly positive aspects mentioned as well, such as: 1. Some degree of originality: While the movie is criticized for its repetitiveness, there's an acknowledgement of the film's attempt to be original in some aspects. 2. Use of non-original music: Although the new score is considered bad, the use of non-original music adds some value to the film. Overall, the reviewer's sentiment can be best described as negative, albeit with a few positive remarks.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Many people think that the ideas about right and wrong are only personal ideas. Bennett wrote The Book of Virtue in which he suggested that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett's book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values, just like honesty, courage, loyalty and many others. For Americans, one basic moral value is honesty. The story about George Washington and the cherry tree teaches this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favourite cherry tree. When his father asked him about it, George said, \\"I did it.\\" Instead of punishment, his father spoke highly of him. Sometimes American honesty--being open and direct--can make people angry. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best virtue\\". Another virtue is perseverance . A story tells of a little train climbing a hill. The hill is too high to get over it. But the train just kept pulling, all the while saying, \\"I think I can, I think I can.\\" At last, the train was over the top because he did not give up. Compassion may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man with compassion. On his way home, he found a poor traveler lying on the road. The kind man, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. Compassion can even turn into a good cycle. In 1992, people in Iowa sent plenty of water to help Floridians hit by storms. The next summer, during the Midwest flood, Florida returned. Millions of Americans are quietly passing along the kindness shown to them. In no way can this book cover all the moral values honored (...) by Americans. But moral virtues are priceless, and they are the base of American culture and any culture. Question: The passage implies that _ . Answer: Options: * the story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" tells that a kind man helps a poor traveler; * some people think Americans go back to traditional moral values; * Americans have many other moral virtues such as courage, loyalty, confidence.; * the story about the little train proves Americans perseverant; Answer:","completion":"* some people think Americans go back to traditional moral values;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Obama: Turkey has the right to defend itself But he maintained that Turkey had a right to defend its airspace and charged that Russian air activity near the Turkey-Syria border has contributed to the crisis. \\"This points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations,\\" Obama said. \\"They are operating very close to a Turkish border, and they are going after moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.\\" Turkey said Tuesday it shot down the Russian plane with a missile strike after repeated warnings to the plane that it had flown over its territory. Saying he expected to speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the coming days to discuss the incident, Obama urged Russia and Turkey to communicate about the details of the operation in order to decrease the chance of escalation. The downing of the Russian plane complicated Hollande's visit to the White House, where he pressed Obama for greater global cooperation on battling ISIS, including with Moscow. Obama appeared resistant to forming any new alliances in battling ISIS, saying he'd already convened more than 60 nations in a bid to curb the group's territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. Hollande has openly called for a greater international effort to push back ISIS, whose killing spree in Paris two weeks ago was the worst terror attack on French soil in more than half a century. READ: Putin calls plane's downing by Turkey 'stab in the back' He said Tuesday greater cooperation between the United States and Russia is required in battling ISIS, though persistent U.S. skepticism about Putin's intentions in Syria have until now prevented any significant military coordination between the two countries. \\"We want to gather all countries,\\" Hollande said. \\"We do not want to exclude anyone.\\" But he also said Russia must pledge to target ISIS terrorists instead of moderate Syrian forces opposed to the government of Bashar al-Assad, a requirement Obama also insisted upon during Tuesday's press conference. \\"Russia right now is a coalition of two -- Iran and Russia -- supporting Assad,\\" Obama said. \\"Russia's the outlier,\\" he added, noting that strikes against moderate opposition fighters \\"bolster the Assad regime.\\" Obama also cited the incident with Turkey as a reason for Russia to turn its focus to fighting only ISIS in Syria, saying that \\"some of those conflicts or potential for escalation are less likely to occur\\" if it narrowed its sights. He said the encounter \\"underscores the importance of our moving the political track along as quickly as possible\\" when it comes to resolving the Syrian civil war, which ISIS has exploited to seize territory. After the press conference, Vice President Joe Biden told reporters gathered in the East Room that he believed \\"Putin is coming to the realization that Assad should transition out.\\" Without any major new commitments to announce alongside Hollande, Obama instead touted a new intelligence sharing agreement announced last week that has helped France target ISIS sites in Raqqa, Syria. And he called on Europe to do more to stop the flow of foreign fighters, share passenger lists and exchange information across borders. READ: Obama and Hollande meet: What a différence in U.S.-French relations Calling ISIS a \\"scourge\\" that \\"must be defeated,\\" Obama said the U.S. stood with France after the brutal massacre in Paris. \\"We'll deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them,\\" Obama said. ISIS \\"cannot be tolerated. It must be destroyed. And we must do it together.\\" Hollande's visit to Washington comes amid a spate of jet-set diplomacy for the French leader. He'll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel Wednesday. He met in Paris with British Prime Minister David Cameron Monday. Obama, who returned from a week-long foreign swing on Monday, made clear in the aftermath of the Paris attacks he wasn't considering a change in strategy, saying instead he was planning to intensify the U.S.-led coalition's air campaign in Iraq and Syria. In his first press conference after the attacks, in Antalya, Turkey, Obama argued testily that alternative plans from Republicans ignored realities on the ground, saying that his own interactions with wounded troops instilled a wariness toward war. After coming under intense criticism for his response to the attacks, Obama turned up his rhetoric on ISIS Sunday, saying during a press conference in Malaysia that his efforts to stamp out the group would succeed. But he nonetheless departed Asia insisting the strategy he's utilized against ISIS is working -- and that other options, like sending in ground troops, aren't being considered. The White House signaled Monday that it already believes U.S. contributions to the anti-ISIS effort are sufficient. \\"The United States is certainly pulling more than our own weight when it comes to the contribution behind this coalition,\\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \\"That's something that we're glad to do.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.

Sentence 2: Titus Geganius Macerinus was a Roman statesman who served as a consul with Publius Minucius Augurinus in 492 BCE . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Select from: [1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"[2]. Yes These two sentences convey the same information about the individuals, Publius Minucius Augurinus and Titus Geganius Macerinus, who both served as consuls in 492 BCE in the Roman Republic. Both sentences show the importance of these two figures in Roman politics at the time and stress their collaboration during their consulship. The primary difference between the sentences is the order in which the names of the consuls are presented, but the core information remains consistent in both sentences, emphasizing their joint role in Roman history. The Roman consulship was the highest elected political office during the Roman Republic, and the two consuls who held the position were responsible for the administration of the government, presiding over the Senate, and acting as military commanders in times of war. Having two consuls who shared power was a political system designed to prevent any one individual from gaining too much power, as it ensured a balance of control between the two consuls in office. Thus, these two sentences both acknowledge the relationship and balanced power of Publius Minucius Augurinus and Titus Geganius Macerinus as Roman consuls in 492 BCE. The information provided in the sentences may serve as a starting point for further exploration into the contributions and impact of these historical figures during their consulship, as well as the broader context of the political environment in the Roman Republic at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the word \\"pull\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? Pull the string gently. Pull the handle towards you.","completion":"Yes, the word \\"pull\\" is used in the same way in both sentences, as it acts as a verb that describes the action of applying force to an object in order to move it closer or change its position relative to the person performing the action. However, while the primary function of \\"pull\\" remains the same, the object and context differ in the two sentences, providing nuanced differences in meaning and application. In the first sentence, \\"Pull the string gently,\\" the object being pulled is a \\"string.\\" The adverb \\"gently\\" provides information on the manner in which the string should be pulled. This sentence implies that the force applied to the string should be moderate and careful, in order to avoid causing any damage or undesirable consequences. This sentence might be used in situations where pulling the string triggers some delicate mechanism or lightly held objects are attached to the string, and a more forceful pull may result in breakage or unintended consequences. In the second sentence, \\"Pull the handle towards you,\\" the object being pulled is a \\"handle.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"towards you\\" clarifies the direction in which the handle should be pulled. In this case, the force applied should be in a direction that moves the handle closer to the person performing this action. The absence of any adverb in this case (such as \\"gently\\" in the first sentence) leaves the appropriate force for pulling the handle unspecified, which may suggest that a gentle or a firmer pull is permissible, depending on the context. This sentence might be used when the handle is a part of a door, a lever for a mechanism, or any other object where pulling it towards oneself has a specific function or outcome. To summarize, in both sentences, \\"pull\\" is indeed used in the same way, as it indicates the action of exerting force on an object. However, the nuances of the sentences arise from the different objects and additional information on the manner or direction of pulling provided in each sentence. Understanding these differences can help one use the word \\"pull\\" appropriately in various contexts and with diverse objects."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: What is a child's reaction likely to be when going to play?

To find the value of \\"t\\", we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4 (because 4 multiplied by \\"t\\" gives us \\"t\\" by itself): -12 / 4 = 4*t / 4 -3 = t So, the value of \\"t\\" is -3.

As the two children engage in their playful foosball competition, their infectious laughter fills the room, drawing the attention of nearby adults who watch on with warm, affectionate smiles.

Though their skills may be limited by their age and experience, the toddlers show determination and laughter in equal measure, embodying the true essence of spirited competition. As the game progresses, the male toddler seems to have an edge, possessing a slightly firmer grasp on the mechanics of the game – likely attributed to the countless hours spent watching his older siblings play on a full-sized table.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Massenet was born at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde née Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies. Ambroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \\"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\\" \\"The prize,\\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \\"I have the prize!!!\\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \\"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\\" The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that gave Jules Massenet his first piano lessons?

Why isn't my phone charging? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: + no + yes","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially the same. They are asking for reasons why a phone might not be charging. Now let's proceed to provide a detailed answer to the underlying inquiry. There could be numerous reasons why your phone is not charging, and I will list some of the most common issues, as well as their solutions: 1. Faulty Charging Cable: Charging cables are often the primary culprit when it comes to charging issues. Examine your cable for any fraying, bending, or damage. If you find any problems or notice that your cable is not securely plugging into your phone, it might be time to invest in a new cable. 2. Malfunctioning Charger: Just like charging cables, chargers can also face wear and tear over time which potentially leads to malfunctioning. To test if the charger is the problem, try using a different charger that you know is working. 3. Dirty or Obstructed Charging Port: Debris or dust can accumulate in your phone's charging port, obstructing proper connection between the phone and the charger. Make sure your charging port is clean by using a toothpick, a cotton swab, or a can of compressed air to gently remove any dirt or debris. 4. Outdated or Corrupted Software: Sometimes, software updates or corrupted software can interfere with your phone's charging capabilities. To fix this, try updating your phone's software to the latest version and reset your phone settings if necessary. 5. Problematic Battery: If your phone battery is not charging at all or discharging very quickly, it could be that the battery has reached the end of its life cycle or is malfunctioning. You may need to replace the battery or take your phone to a professional for further diagnosis. 6. Charging with a Computer USB Port: If you are charging your phone using a computer's USB port, it might charge slower than with a wall charger due to the lower power output of USB ports. If you can, try using a wall charger for faster and more efficient charging. 7. Damaged or Loose Internal Connections: The internal connections of your phone can become loose or damaged due to drops or impact. Hardware issues like these may require professional help to diagnose and repair the problem. 8. Defective Phone: In rare cases, the phone itself might have a manufacturing defect that prevents it from charging. If your phone is still under warranty, contact the manufacturer or your carrier for a repair or replacement. To summarize, both questions are the same, and there can be a variety of reasons why your phone is not charging.

Write an article that answers the following question: In which quarter did the teams both score the same number of field goals?","completion":"Title: When Did the Teams Match Field Goals? Analyzing Key Quarters In the rigorous and thrilling universe of sports, particularly team sports like football and basketball, one element that thrills fans and players alike is the competition concerning scoring field goals. Field goals represent the heart of such sports dynamics; they are valuable points scored beyond the domain of touch-downs or three-pointers. However, it's worth noting that this query does not indicate a specific game, team, or even sport. As such, we can only speak generally about when teams may commonly match each other in terms of field goals scored. Before delving into that, let's quickly establish what constitutes a quarter in sport. In American football and many other sports, games are divided into four sections known as quarters. The first and second quarters typically represent the first half of the game before halftime, and the third and fourth quarters make up the second half. The duration of these quarters varies from sport to sport; for instance, in professional National Football League (NFL) games each quarter lasts about 15 minutes, whereas in National Basketball Association (NBA) games, each quarter lasts around 12 minutes. Analyzing the phenomenon of teams scoring the same number of field goals in a quarter, be it basketball, football, or any sport, requires understanding of team strategies, skills, and performance dynamics. That being said, the often high-paced and unpredictable nature of sport means it's challenging to specify a common quarter where teams frequently score equal field goals. Generally, the first quarter often witnesses more balance in scored field goals. The reason for this apparent symmetry could be the fact that both teams start the game with equal momentum, energy, and opportunity. They look to probe each other’s defenses while minimizing errors and mistakes that could lead to conceded points. However, this pattern is by no means a hard and fast rule. For example, in some games, you may find that teams match each other in terms of field goals in the third or fourth quarters. This can happen particularly when the teams are evenly matched in skill, strategy, and stamina. In certain situational conditions, the fourth quarter can frequently be a period where teams score the same number of field goals. This can be attributed to the mounting pressure and urgency where each team can be concentrated on maximizing their scores and minimizing mistakes. In these circumstances, teams might lock into a tit-for-tat scoring flow, leading to matched field goals. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider that this phenomenon of scoring an equal number of field goals can happen in any quarter, depending on the form and strategy of the teams involved. Factors such as the players' physical conditions, weather conditions, the dynamics of home and away games, team morale, and injury situations can all potentially influence the quarter in which teams may tally their field goals. Additionally, while equal field goals might make for a great narrative, it doesn't necessarily translate into an overall match draw. Different aspects, such as free throws in basketball or touchdowns and points-after in American football, play pivotal roles in the final computation of the game's score. In conclusion, the occurrence of teams both scoring the same number of field goals in a particular quarter is a fascinating aspect in competitive team sports, and it can happen in any quarter due to a multitude of reasons. This event tends to add to the suspense and excitement of the game, keeping fans glued to their seats as they anticipate the narrative, strategy, and outcome of the subsequent quarters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: On February 7, 2012, Metallica announced that it would start a new music festival called Orion Music + More, which took place on June 23 and 24, 2012, in Atlantic City. Metallica also confirmed that it would headline the festival on both days and would perform two of its most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: The Black Album on one night, and Ride the Lightning on the other. In a July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Ulrich said Metallica would not release its new album until at least early 2014. In November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases. The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label. Blackened releases will be licensed through Warner subsidiary Rhino Entertainment in North America and internationally through Universal Music. On September 20, 2012, Metallica announced via its official website that a new DVD containing footage of shows it performed in Quebec in 2009 would be released that December; fans would get the chance to vote for two setlists that would appear on the DVD. The film, titled Quebec Magnetic, was released in the U.S. on December 10, 2012.In an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, \\"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation [of Death Magnetic]\\". He also said, \\"I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013.\\" Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimród and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27. In an interview dated July 22, 2013, Ulrich told Ultimate Guitar, \\"2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record\\"; he said the album will most likely be released during 2015.

The reviewer acknowledges the progress in Venezuelan film production as well as the improvements in storytelling, arguments, and budget, which are aspects reflecting the movie in a positive way. The accuracy of the film in portraying the real events that occurred during that time in Venezuela is another positive aspect mentioned by the reviewer. This indicates that the movie effectively captures the political climate and offers an authentic representation of the situation, which can be seen as commendable and flattering. However, there are also unflattering aspects mentioned in the review. The reviewer points out that there is a lot of unnecessary nudity in the movie, which might be off-putting for some viewers and can be perceived as a negative aspect of the film. Additionally, the movie is described as violent, which could potentially dissuade some potential viewers from giving it a chance. The comparison with the violence in US productions is somewhat neutral, as it is used to provide context for the violence in the movie. While it can be interpreted as stating that the violent nature of the film is not out of the ordinary when compared to other productions, it does not necessarily praise the movie for its violent content. In summary, the review offers a balanced perspective on the film, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. While the progress and accuracy of the movie are praised, the unnecessary nudity and violence could be seen as unflattering elements, leading to a mixed overall impression of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Given the temperature stays constant, will the volume of the air inside the compressor increase or decrease? Aaron needs to clean his computer. He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube. Hint: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. The answer is:","completion":"The volume of the air inside the compressor will decrease. This conclusion is based on Boyle's law. According to Boyle's law, under conditions where the temperature is constant, the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure. In simple terms, when the pressure increases, the volume decreases. In the scenario, the air compressor works by compressing the air inside it, which means it is increasing the pressure on the air. Therefore, under the constant temperature condition, the volume of this air will decrease as a result of the increased pressure caused by the compressor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal.

Article: Sitting for too long could be responsible for 4 percent of global deaths After an increasing amount of research has already outlined the negative effects of sitting for long periods of time, a new study has now found that long periods of inactivity are to blame for nearly 4 percent of all deaths worldwide. Published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and carried out by researchers from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and San Jorge University in Zaragoza, Spain, the study looked at 54 countries across the world using data from between 2002 to 2011. The data revealed that over 60% of people worldwide spend more than three hours a day sitting down, with adults spending on average 4.7 hours of their day sat down. According to the study this inactivity is causing 3.8% of deaths across the world -- approximately 433,000 deaths a year. The team found that the highest rates of death were found in the Western Pacific, followed by parts of Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region, America and Southeast Asia. Looking at the results by country, the highest rates were found in Lebanon (11.6%), the Netherlands (7.6%) and Denmark (6.9%), while the lowest rates were in Mexico (0.6%), Myanmar (1.3%) and Bhutan (1.6%). Spain falls within the average range with 3.7% of deaths, with Canada and the USA both above the average with 4.7 percent and 4.2 percent of deaths respectively. Several studies published in 2012 by the journal Lancet already that showed 31% of the global population fails to meet the current recommendations for physical activity, with the authors of the study calculating that increasing active time and reducing sitting time in the countries studied could increase life expectancy by 0.20 years. According to their analysis, reducing sitting time by two hours -- around a 50% reduction on the average sitting time found in the study -- would result in a 2.3% decrease in risk of mortality (three times less). Even a reduction of just 10 percent -- or half an hour a day -- could reduce mortality by 0.6%. The team now advise that sedentary behavior should be minimized in order to prevent premature deaths around the world and suggest that strategic national health campaigns, such as bike-sharing systems, could be rolled out by countries to get the population moving more. ||||| The next time you wrap up your work day and realise you've been sitting in front of the computer for almost eight straight hours, maybe you won't feel so proud of yourself. A new study, conducted in 54 countries around the world, declares that 3.8% of all deaths are due to the fact that society spends more than three hours a day sitting down. Each year people go into September with a number of resolutions. Exercising and not spending so much time on the couch tend to be some of these good intentions. 31% of the worldwide population does not meet the current recommendations for physical activity according to several studies published in 2012 by the journal The Lancet. In addition, a lack of exercise is associated with major noncommunicable diseases and with deaths of any cause -inactivity is the culprit behind 6% to 9% of total worldwide deaths-. Today's lifestyle has an impact on these numbers. In fact, various studies over the last decade have demonstrated how the excessive amount of time we spend sitting down may increase the risk of death, regardless of whether or not we exercise. A new study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and in which San Jorge University in Zaragoza (Spain) participated, now estimates the proportion of deaths attributable to that 'chair effect' in the population of 54 countries, using data from 2002 to 2011. \\"It is important to minimise sedentary behaviour in order to prevent premature deaths around the world,\\" Leandro Rezende, lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) explains. He also highlights that \\"cutting down on the amount of time we sit could increase life expectancy by 0.20 years in the countries analysed.\\" The results reveal that over 60% of people worldwide spend more than three hours a day sitting down -the average in adults is 4.7 hours/day-, and this is the culprit behind 3.8% of deaths (approximately 433,000 deaths/year). Among the territories studied, there were more deaths in the regions of the Western Pacific, followed by European countries, the Eastern Mediterranean, America and Southeast Asia. The highest rates were found in Lebanon (11.6%), the Netherlands (7.6%) and Denmark (6.9%), while the lowest rates were in Mexico (0.6%), Myanmar (1.3%) and Bhutan (1.6%). Spain falls within the average range with 3.7% of deaths due to this 'chair effect'. More movement, fewer deaths The authors calculate that reducing the amount of time we sit by about two hours (i.e., 50%) would mean a 2.3% decrease in mortality (three times less), although it is not possible to confirm whether this is a causal relationship. Even a more modest reduction in sitting time, by 10% or half an hour per day, could have an immediate impact on all causes of mortality (0.6%) in the countries evaluated. In the words of the experts, measures aimed at addressing the determining factors behind this sedentary conduct would be necessary. \\"Some examples of this approach were recently highlighted by the World Health Organization,\\" adds Rezende. \\"For example, a strategic health communication campaign was developed to promote physical activity among women in Tonga (Oceania), while a bicycle-sharing system was developed in Iran in addition to a sustainable transport system in Germany,\\" he concludes. |||||Summary:","completion":"A new study from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and San Jorge University in Zaragoza, Spain, shows that sitting more than three hours a day is responsible for 4% of global deaths, or 433,000 deaths per year.

Thailand The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Hidden Temple of Amoria Genre: Adventure, Mystery, Drama Plot Overview: In the lush jungles of Thailand, archeologist Dr. Samantha Reynolds and her team embark on an exhilarating journey to locate the lost temple of Amoria. The temple, believed to be from the ancient Sukhothai period, is said to house the highly coveted Heart of Amoria - a rare gem known to hold mystical powers that would change the course of history. As Dr. Reynolds and her team navigate the treacherous landscape, they'll encounter unexpected challenges, form unlikely alliances, and unravel the mysteries that haunt the hidden temple. Act 1: Dr. Samantha Reynolds, a dedicated and world-renowned archeologist, is approached by a mysterious investor who offers to fund an expedition in search of the lost temple of Amoria. The investor discloses that according to ancient Thai legends, the temple may contain the Heart of Amoria - a mythical gem with the power to change the course of history. Intrigued by the challenge, Dr. Reynolds assembles a diverse team of experts, each with skills that are essential for the journey: a linguist, a geologist, a botanist, and an ex-military survivalist. The team arrives in Thailand and begins their trek into the dense jungle. Along the way, they discover cryptic runes that seem to guide them in the right direction. As they venture deeper into the jungle, the team faces increasing physical challenges and realizes that they are being pursued by a group of ruthless treasure hunters, led by the cunning and dangerous Viktor Ivanov. Act 2: In the heart of the jungle, Dr. Reynolds and her team encounter a young Thai villager named Niran, who harbors a deep knowledge of the stories surrounding the temple. Niran agrees to help them in their quest and shares with them the tale of Amoria, a venerated Thai warrior-queen who was said to have been gifted the Heart of Amoria by celestial beings. The gem granted her the power to shape the destiny of the kingdom, but it was lost when her enemies destroyed the temple. As the team continues their exploration, Dr. Reynolds and Niran grow closer, discovering a shared passion for preserving the past and unlocking its mysteries. Their bond is tested by the dangers they face, including treacherous terrain, venomous creatures, and the relentless pursuit of Viktor and his men. The team must also wrestle with internal divisions, as their conflicting motives and beliefs threaten to tear them apart. Act 3: The team, guided by Niran's knowledge and the runes, finally uncovers the entrance to the hidden temple of Amoria. In a climactic confrontation, Viktor and his men ambush the group, and a thrilling battle ensues. As the temple begins to crumble around them, the team makes a desperate attempt to escape with the Heart of Amoria. The journey reaches its emotional apex when Dr. Reynolds, who had been skeptical of the gem's mystical powers all along, is forced to decide between using it to save Niran, who has been mortally wounded in combat, or preserving it for the sake of historical understanding. In the end, Dr. Reynolds chooses to honor Niran's legacy and the bonds they forged by ensuring the safety of the Heart of Amoria as a symbol of their shared passion for the past. Epilogue: Now back in their respective countries, the team members continue their pursuits grounded in the life-changing experiences they shared in Thailand. Dr. Reynolds remains dedicated to the preservation of history, but now with a renewed understanding of the personal and emotional connections that drive her work. As the legend of the hidden temple and the Heart of Amoria are immortalized in the annals of archeology, the true treasure that each individual gained from the expedition was the friendships forged and the lessons learned about the power of sacrifice, loyalty, and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Editor's note: Tom Wilkerson is chief executive officer of the United States Naval Institute, a nonprofit professional association which describes itself as an independent forum for examining issues related to the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard. He spent 31 years in the military, rising to major general of Marines and, in his last assignment, serving as commander, Marine Forces Reserve. Retired Major General Tom Wilkerson says the U.S. should attack the pirates at their bases. (CNN) -- It is well past time to take a serious look at piracy off the coast of Africa. Initially, the U.S. ignored the threat, and when public outcry about our seeming indifference became louder, we formed a combined task force of international navies in the Gulf of Aden under command of a U.S. Navy rear admiral to \\"deter, disrupt and thwart\\" the pirates.

Options: - asia - india - festival - arabia - istanbul","completion":"In the United States, a bazaar is likely to be called a \\"festival.\\" The term bazaar is most commonly associated with a marketplace where various goods and services are sold in a lively and bustling atmosphere. However, in the context of the US, the word \\"festival\\" is more commonly used to describe these types of events because it is a more familiar term for the general population. A festival is an event that is typically characterized by various activities, performers, and vendors selling a wide array of goods or services. Festivals in the US may include attractions like live music, dancing, food vendors, crafts, games, and other forms of entertainment. Festivals are generally centered around a particular theme, culture or community, which is why you may find events such as art festivals, food festivals, cultural festivals, and holiday festivals throughout the country. While it's true that \\"bazaars\\" can be focused on a specific culture or region (such as \\"asia\\", \\"india\\", \\"arabia\\", and \\"istanbul\\" as mentioned in the list of options), the term festival is more prominent and better understood in America. This is due to the fact that the US is a melting pot of many different cultures and languages, and the term festival is more universally accepted as a term to describe a large gathering for celebration and enjoyment. In conclusion, if you find yourself in the United States and are describing a bazaar or a similar event, it's more appropriate to use the term \\"festival\\" as it is easier for people to understand and identify with. Though the specific naming of a festival might include references to regions and cultures, such as an \\"Asian Festival\\" or an \\"Indian Festival\\", the term festival is still going to be the most suitable option to convey the idea of a bazaar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps.

Answer the following question: Background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Paragraph: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B.

The crab cakes were delicious and of generous size, the eggs were poached to perfection, and they didn't over do it with the hollandaise. It was a little interesting that they served the hash browns underneath the benedict, but nevertheless it was great. I also had a smoothie made from mangos and peaches, and it was delectable. Highly recommended, particularly after a late night or one with no sleep. I appreciated the carafe of coffee they left at the table. I also ate lunch here, and had the Cobb salad. It was good, if a little heavy on the blue cheese. I'd hit this place for breakfast rather than lunch.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze the overall tone and key aspects mentioned: 1.

Command: and { only { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } } ; eq { hop { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } ; tournament } ; pga championship } } = true Explanation: 1. We start with the \\"filter_not_eq\\" operation: \\"filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 }\\". This means we create a subview of the table by selecting all rows where the number of wins is NOT equal to 0. 2. Next, we use the \\"only\\" operation: \\"only { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } }\\". From the subview created in step 1, we check if there is exactly one row left. 3. Now, we use the \\"hop\\" operation: \\"hop { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } ; tournament }\\". This returns the value under the \\"tournament\\" column in the row we got in step 1. 4. We then use the \\"eq\\" operation: \\"eq { hop { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } ; tournament } ; pga championship }\\". We check if the tournament value we got in step 3 is equal to \\"pga championship\\". 5. Finally, we combine everything using the \\"and\\" operation: \\"and { only { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } } ; eq { hop { filter_not_eq { all_rows ; wins ; 0 } ; tournament } ; pga championship } }\\".

Summarize this article: A 17th body is recovered from the Costa Concordia, but at least 16 more people are missing as weather hampers efforts to remove a half-million gallons of fuel. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports from Isola del Giglio. Published 11:55 a.m. ET GIGLIO, Italy -- Inclement weather on Sunday has shut down search and salvage efforts at the site of the Costa Concordia cruise ship wreck off the island of Giglio near the Tuscan coast. The ship shifted more than one inch overnight, and rescue divers were pulled from the water and are waiting for better conditions, NBC News has learned. On Saturday, divers searching the submerged sixth floor deck found a woman’s body – the 17th body found since the ship ran aground on Jan. 13. Sixteen people are still unaccounted for. Related: 17th body found on Costa Concordia Separately, a body found on the ship’s deck on Jan. 28 was identified as Erika Soria Molina, 25, of Peru. Molina was wearing a service uniform, and studied tourism in Peru and was born in the Andean city of Cuzco, southeast of Lima, the Associated Press reported. High winds and rough seas delayed plans to begin pumping 500,000 gallons of fuel off the Concordia. That effort will likely continue midweek. A barge carrying pumping equipment that was attached to the capsized ship was withdrawn after strong winds and high waves worsened conditions for the divers working on the huge wreck.

At least 15 people died in the accident, and rescuers continue to search for others missing. Launch slideshow The operation, aimed at preventing an environmental disaster in the pristine waters off a marine nature reserve, could take up to one month to complete. On Monday, Costa is expected to present a waste disposal plan, NBC News has learned. Furthermore, the company is considering offers for ship removal. The company is weighing bids and is expected to make its decision -- based on method and costs -- in two months. The removal could take up to 10 months. The Costa Concordia disaster is expected to trigger the most expensive maritime insurance claim ever, and has set off a legal battle in which U.S. and Italian lawyers are preparing class-action and individual lawsuits against the operator, Costa Cruises. In a bid to limit the fallout, Costa, a unit of Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise ship operator, has offered the more than 3,000 passengers 14,460 each in compensation on condition they drop any legal action.

A sixth-former who became introverted and withdrawn when he met his first girlfriend was found hanged after spending his final three hours searching for death metal songs on YouTube, an inquest heard. Oliver King, 16, left no suicide note and had never received any medical help for depression or mental illness. However, he texted a friend weeks before his death saying 'I imagine killing myself every day'. Police also found deleted images on his iPod which included the words: 'I’m sorry I want to give up. I’m sorry I want to die. I’m. sorry I want to kill myself.' A coroner ruled he had been going through 'some dark periods' generally and was 'trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice'. Oliver's parents, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, told the inquest he turned from an outgoing schoolboy into an introvert after beginning his first serious relationship. The teenager began spending little time. at home, lost weight and fell behind with his A-level studies. He had. coursework deadlines the day after he died in February last year and relations with his parents became strained. A year before he died, he began his first serious relationship and began wearing dark clothes, long hair and make-up and listening to a new range of bands, his parents said. The inquest heard Oliver spent three hours on the night he died viewing songs including The Body of. Death of the Man With The Body of Death by Pinkly Smooth, before taking. his own life while his mother was out of the house. After the hearing his father Adrian. King, 43, a management and IT consultant, said: 'I think the music did. contribute to his state of mind. He was hanging out with the wrong crowd. and I believe this lifestyle was more to blame than anything else. 'He had changed his clothes, his music, his address and his face. He was manipulated and felt isolated. 'Anyone who had met Oliver a year before his death would not have recognised him a year later. 'A year before he was a regular 15-year-old. He had friends, was happy with his life, had a good relationship with his parents, was gifted at art and progressing well at school.' But Oliver's girlfriend denied the music was 'dark', as the coroner asked, and instead pointed to the fact the schoolboy 'did not feel comfortable at home' and had been stressed with coursework. Another school friend said he had been teased over his new look. Oliver was found hanging by his mother Diane King, whose attempts to revive him failed and he died in Rotherham Hospital. She told the inquest Oliver, who lived. with his father after the couple divorced, preferred to be at his. girlfriend’s house and stayed out most days and. evenings as well as studying. 'He was very secretive and wouldn’t tell me where he was or where he was going,' said Mrs King. Two weeks before his death he moved back in with his mother, the inquest heard. Outgoing: Oliver pictured when he was on holiday on the Greek island of Zante in 2009. The inquest heard Oliver’s. relationship may have hit a 'rocky patch' and his girlfriend made 20. attempts to contact him in a short space of time just before he was. found. A text from Oliver to her read: 'Please, please stay strong you are not leaving.' His iPod contained deleted images with. the words 'everything will be OK in the end, if it’s not OK its the. end.' Another said: 'I have driven myself to the edge. I can't take it. any more.' His girlfriend, whom the coroner asked not to be named, arrived at the house with another boy after Oliver had been found. Happier times: The schoolboy on a 2011 outing. Mrs. King told the inquest: 'She said: \\"Is it Oliver? Is he dead?\\" She didn’t seem overly. upset. I thought had they split up and is he the new boyfriend.' Det Con Ian Hampshire, who. investigated Oliver’s death, said a fellow pupil told him: 'Oliver felt. trapped and always had to do what his girlfriend wanted to do.' And Mr King told the inquest he and his. ex-wife had clashed with the girl’s parents over the amount of time. Oliver was spending at their house. But. the girl told the inquest Oliver had become 'very stressed' with his. coursework, especially ICT, and he had project deadlines the day after. his death. She said it was. his choice to wear eyeliner but he had not changed his clothes since. meeting her. They shared the same interest in music, including the bands Avenged Sevenfold and Black Veil Brides, but he was not. associated with any particular group. Asked by the coroner if it was 'dark' music she replied: 'Not from my perspective. I don’t see it as dark music.' She added he spent a lot of time with her. because he 'did not feel comfortable' at home, and denied telling him. their relationship was over. Another schoolfriend said Oliver was 'kind and. full of joy' before he returned to school in the September term. 'He had. dramatically lost weight and wore eyeliner,' he told the inquest. 'He was aware there was some. name-calling and ill-feeling from some of the other pupils.' The sixth-former had been struggling. with his schoolwork but improved after a clear-the-air meeting at school, his head of sixth form Patrick Buttrell told the inquest. Mr Buttrell added there was no official dress code for sixth formers but he had asked Oliver to tone down his make-up. 'It was a light-hearted conversation, he gave me a bit of a smile and said he knew it was over the top,' said Mr Buttrell. Oliver in the Canary Islands in 2002. His father claimed music and lifestyle had contributed to his state of mind. The teenager’s death triggered an investigation involving childrens’ services, public health and police in Rotherham. Deputy Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis said Oliver had 'loving and caring' parents and his new relationship had come at the expense of family and friends. 'He was trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice,' said Mr Curtis. He was 'paranoid' over his relationship with his girlfriend which 'may have reached a rocky patch' in his mind and he was troubled by his schoolwork.

I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet.

It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

This statement tells us that there has been a significant increase in the number of hotels, restaurants, and shops in the area (they have proliferated). This expansion, coupled with the warm welcome and the best of Lakeland hospitality, aims to cater to a growing number of visitors (tourists, travelers, etc.). Hypothesis: There are hotels, restaurants, and shops in the area. Now let's look at the hypothesis. It states that in the area, there are indeed hotels, restaurants, and shops. The hypothesis does not require the claimed growth in numbers, nor the quality of hospitality mentioned in the premise. However, it can be reasonably deduced that if the premise is true, which means that the number of such establishments has increased, they must already exist in the area.

Dylan Fletcher and Alain Sign complete the 15-strong British team in the 49er class after a close selection battle. The 29-year-old Patience, from Aberdeen, admitted to mixed emotions over his inclusion. \\"It's still a special day but mixed feelings I suppose because I am combining two campaigns to try and still achieve the same goal,\\" he told BBC Scotland. Patience and Willis had already qualified for Rio in the 470, but the British pair were withdrawn by the British Olympic Association and Royal Yachting Association (RYA) after Willis' illness was diagnosed in December. Patience was then paired with Grube, 31, and the duo had to re-qualify. Mark England, Team GB's Chef de Mission for Rio, admits things have not been easy for Patience in his bid to make his second Olympics. \\"It's been a challenging time for Luke having been selected back in September and then having to refocus following Elliot's diagnosis,\\" he said. \\"Chris and Luke can now forge a strong partnership and we wish Elliot all the best and hope to see him on the water again soon.\\" While Patience clearly still has former partner Willis in his thoughts, he is also looking forward to another chapter in his Olympic career after winning silver at London 2012 with Stuart Bithell in the 470. \\"I hope I can draw on the London experience, and with Chris being a first time Olympian, between us it will keep things grounded,\\" he added. \\"Four years ago I was probably the most excited man with Stuart in front of the camera, but business will be business.

When we talk about naive physics reasoning, we're just thinking about what makes sense in a simple way without using any fancy science or equipment.

Then pour it into a cup and enjoy your healthy smoothie! 2. Put the fruits and veggies on a table and use your hands to squish and mix them all up, then try to drink from the messy mix. The first solution makes more sense in terms of simple thinking. We're using a blender to easily mix and blend the ingredients into a smoothie.

Movie title: 15 Minutes Context: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser.

This visit comes at a crucial time, as both Pakistan and Hong Kong face several challenges on the economic and political front. By establishing strong diplomatic relationships, the two sides hope to foster mutual growth and development. The visit, scheduled for a week, will include several high-profile meetings with Hong Kong government officials, business leaders and investors. The Prime Minister's goal is to showcase Pakistan's potential as a lucrative investment destination, as the country boasts of having a highly skilled workforce, a rapidly growing economy, and a strategic location at the crossroads of the East and West. One of the main focuses of the Prime Minister's visit will be to address the concerns of the flourishing Pakistani community in Hong Kong. Community leaders will discuss with the Prime Minister the issues Pakistani expatriates face in Hong Kong, such as integration, employment opportunities, and social welfare. The Prime Minister is expected to address these concerns and highlight the contributions of Pakistanis to Hong Kong's growth. Moreover, the Prime Minister will be engaging with Hong Kong's business community to explore potential opportunities for collaboration in various sectors, such as infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy. Increased trade between the two economies is another key area where both parties may find mutual benefits. The visit is expected to result in signing several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and business deals that will bring in new investment and create jobs in both regions. In an official statement released ahead of this landmark visit, the Prime Minister expressed optimism about the future of Pakistan-Hong Kong relations. In particular, he recognized that by pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise, Pakistan and Hong Kong could collectively face and overcome the challenges of the 21st century.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said. Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are.

The couch, an heirloom piece she had inherited from her grandmother, was vintage Victorian-era in style – deep buttoned upholstery and carved wooden legs – but reupholstered in a more contemporary pattern complete with an array of colourful and textured cushions. Not only were these cushions beloved decorative elements, but they also revived memories so sweet that Mary would often sink into them with a cup of tea and a good book, sometimes losing entire afternoons to the comfort and nostalgia they offered. Meanwhile, the hardwood floor underneath, a shade of chestnut that complemented the couch and cushions perfectly, was a stage to countless footsteps, crawling babies, and pieces of fallen food that evoked a gentle laugh during family dinners. Time had etched itself in every grain of the unyielding wood, each imperfection telling a story of its own. The living room itself was the heartbeat of Mary’s home. Pictures hung on the wall, each frame capturing a fragment of Mary's life – a graduation, a wedding, a first baby, and countless holiday gatherings. The room was more than just four walls, it was a container of the memories Mary held dear, each item in the room breathed life into those memories, and her heart would swell looking at them. The window, standing tall and dominating one corner of the room, was an important element that had seen outside world changes with time. Its crystal-clear radiance allowed sunlight to brighten the room, reinforcing the homely atmosphere that was so comforting. It orchestrated a waltz of light and shadow within the room each day, bathing the couch, the cushions, the floor, and everything else in diaphanous tones of dawn, daylight, dusk, and dim moonlight. The window was the bridge to the outside world, bringing in the seasons into her room, it was summer yellow, autumn orange, winter grey, and spring green all over the year. In essence, the room, with its couch by the window, soft cushions, and hardwood floor, was a cherished space. A piece of the world curated precisely to her preferences, tastes, and memories. It was her escape, her sanctuary, and, entire universe. It was a welcoming norm in the chaos of life and a steadfast reminder of time's passage and the beautiful impermanence of it all.

Hypothesis: Memento is from America","completion":"After analyzing the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is true. As stated in the text, Memento is a 2000 American neo-noir psychological thriller film. It is important to break down the information provided to understand the basis for this conclusion. First, the paragraph specifies the year and genre - it was released in 2000 and falls under the neo-noir psychological thriller category. This helps to contextualize the movie within a specific time period and a stylistic scope, but it does not directly address the hypothesis. Second, the paragraph mentions that Memento was directed and written by Christopher Nolan, a renowned British-American filmmaker known for his thought-provoking films such as Inception, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Although Christopher Nolan holds dual citizenship, the information given in the paragraph does not specifically contribute to the support of the hypothesis. Third, the movie Memento was produced by Suzanne and Jennifer Todd. The Todd sisters are American film producers with numerous successful productions under their belt. This information indicates that key personnel involved in the film have American nationalities, further supporting the hypothesis. Moreover, the paragraph provides information about the script’s origin, stating that it was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who later wrote the story \\"Memento Mori\\" from the concept. Jonathan Nolan, like his brother Christopher Nolan, holds dual British-American citizenship. Lastly, the paragraph lists the film's leading cast members - Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. All three of them are known actors in the American film industry. Guy Pearce, although born in England, has predominantly worked in the American film industry throughout his career. Carrie-Anne Moss is a Canadian actress, known for her roles in various American productions. Joe Pantoliano is an American actor. The presence of these recognizable actors from the American film industry further supports the hypothesis that Memento is an American film. In summary, the given information in the paragraph indicates that Memento is a 2000 neo-noir psychological thriller film, directed, and written by Christopher Nolan, and stars prominent actors from the American film industry. With key personnel such as the producers and main cast members being linked to the American film industry, the hypothesis is indeed true: Memento is from America."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

They lived in a town where people voted on important decisions. One day, they had to vote on whether to increase or decrease taxes. This meant that people would either have to give more or less money to the town government. Leslie thought it would be a good idea to increase taxes, which means giving more money to the town. She believed that this extra money could help some people who didn't have homes, by building a nice and warm homeless shelter for them to stay in. So, Leslie voted to increase the taxes. But Kevin felt differently. He didn't want to pay more money in taxes and thought that people should keep more of their own money. Kevin believed there might be other ways to help those who don't have homes, without asking everyone to pay more money. So, Kevin voted to decrease the taxes. Now, let's see the options to continue the story: (a). Leslie didn't want to pay a higher rate to benefit the homeless shelter. This option doesn't make sense because Leslie already voted to increase taxes, which means she wants to pay more money to help the homeless shelter. So we should not choose this one. (b).

What are the most important words in the following sentence: my heart beats to the rhythm of ballet","completion":"To identify the most important words in a sentence, we have to determine the words that contribute the most to its meaning. 1. \\"my heart\\" - These two words act as the subject of the sentence, carrying significant weight by telling us who or what is performing the action. 2. \\"beats\\" - This is the verb, or action, of the sentence. It tells what the subject - in this case, \\"my heart\\" - is doing. Without a verb, a sentence has no action or state of being. 3. \\"rhythm\\" - This noun adds more specific information about how the heart is beating. 4. \\"ballet\\" - This is another significant noun, it tells us what type of rhythm the heart is beating to. The rhythm of ballet implies a certain grace, elegance, or cadence. 5. \\"to\\" & \\"the\\" - These are prepositions and articles which, while necessary for the sentence's grammatical structure, don't carry significant meaning on their own. So, after breaking it down, the most important words in this sentence are \\"my heart\\", \\"beats\\", \\"rhythm\\", and \\"ballet\\".

One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Would field D have higher or lower potential energy than field C? Hint: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided and the information given, we can determine whether field D has higher or lower potential energy than field C by following these steps: 1. We know that both charge A and charge B are negative. This means they repel each other, as like charges repel one another. 2. We know that the electric charges are moving spontaneously from field C to field D. 3. According to the hint, electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. Based on these steps, we can conclude that field D has lower potential energy than field C. This is because the electric charges are moving from field C to field D, which indicates they are moving from a region of higher potential energy to a region of lower potential energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term slighted indicates a deliberate act of disrespect or insult. This could have been something seemingly insignificant at the time, like ignoring or failing to acknowledge Nelson, or something more substantial, like a direct insult, condescension, or belittlement in a professional setting. Regardless of the specifics, Michael's actions hurt Nelson to such an extent that he felt the need for revenge, to make Michael pay for the slight he had perceived. Nelson, then, set out on a mission to ruin Michael's career. This might involve scheming, backstabbing, sowing seeds of doubt among colleagues or superiors, or employing more elaborate strategies. Nelson's goal would be to ensure that Michael either loses his professional standing, gets overlooked for promotions, or potentially even loses his job. It's clear that feelings of resentment and a strong desire for retribution are driving Nelson. This motive adds depth to both characters, creating potential for a narrative where the conflict between them drives much of the action. The emotions, strategies, and consequences involved in such a plot can provide a lot of material for engaging storytelling. However, it's also worth considering the implications and potential outcomes of such actions. For instance, they could lead to further intensification of the conflict, agonizing regrets, or bitter life lessons, depending upon how the characters react to the escalating situation. In sum, the statement \\"Nelson was on a mission to ruin Michael's career because Michael had slighted him in the past\\" offers a great launchpad for a narrative full of drama, personal animosity, and bitter professional rivalry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The task statement asks how more rain will affect less or smaller caverns and requires that the answer should indicate whether it will have more, less, or no effect on the second effect mentioned (acidic reaction). To elaborate, the question is: If more rain occurs, how will it influence the occurrence of the acidic reaction in less or smaller caverns? Answer: More More rain will lead to an increased rate of acidic reactions in less or smaller caverns since excess water will amplify the effects of the erosion process. This results in limestone dissolving more quickly than in larger caves, where water may be dispersed over a larger surface area. Overall, this will speed up the formation of caves and the expansion of existing smaller caverns."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created. - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468.

Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum . - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record.

Around 1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries.

Thus, the inclusion of \\"Hey Arnold!\\" in exception to the reviewer's normally unfavored category implies a more positive sentiment towards it. It indicates that 'Hey Arnold!' has managed to be an outlier in the author's usual disdain for cartoons derived from TV shows, suggesting a liking, or at least an acceptance, that is not usual with other similar shows. So, although the sentence seems somewhat negative at first glance due to the reviewer's general stance, the exception made for 'Hey Arnold!' tilts the overall sentiment into the positive territory.

What was the real name of the pirate, Blackbeard????","completion":"Blackbeard, known as one of history's most notorious pirates, was born Edward Teach or Edward Thatch. Though there is some uncertainty surrounding the exact spelling of his surname, historians believe that it was likely one of these two variants. He was born around 1680 in Bristol, England. Edward Teach began his sailing career as a privateer during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) on the side of the British, attacking enemy ships and French and Spanish merchant vessels. When the war came to an end, many privateers transitioned into piracy to maintain their profession. Blackbeard earned his fearsome name due to his long, black beard, which he often braided and tied with ribbons. He would also insert slow-burning fuses into his beard and light them during battle to create a terrifying and menacing appearance. Furthermore, he donned various weapons, including knives, swords, and pistols, to intimidate his opponents and established a legendary reputation. Blackbeard roamed the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain's North-American colonies, posing a significant threat to the sea trade industry. He commanded multiple ships, with his most famous ship being the Queen Anne's Revenge, a former French slave ship he captured and converted into a fearsome warship armed with up to 40 cannons. In June 1718, Blackbeard blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina, temporarily paralyzing the city's trade. This event drew the attention of the provincial governments of British North America and paved the way for his demise. Following a royal pardon for all pirates who surrendered, Blackbeard accepted the pardon but quickly returned to piracy. In response to the ongoing threat, the then Governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood, ordered Lieutenant Robert Maynard to capture Blackbeard. On November 22, 1718, Maynard and his men engaged Blackbeard's crew in a bloody battle near Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. Blackbeard was killed in the confrontation, and his head was hung from the bowsprit of Maynard's ship as evidence of his defeat.

Entrepreneurs Give Automatons A Good Name Michael Scorsese’s instant classic Hugo is about a young orphaned boy, Hugo, who finds a new family. But the other diminutive character that breathes life into this magical tale is the automaton, a shiny doll-like figure, made of metal, that has the benevolent gaze of a Buddha while suggesting a reality-transforming willfulness as soon as you insert a heart-shaped key into its waiting lock. This is no R2-D2 or C-3PO, folks. Hugo’s metal creation is a really classy eye-riveting automaton. Not at all like the human automatons on the assembly line engaged in mindless tasks, or office drones or business owners who do whatever it is they do with their minds light years away from the business at hand. The automaton in Hugo – the work of Dick George whose genius goes back to the first Star War movies – seems to have a soul, even though its innards are mechanical. “He’s a character in himself so, in a way, it’s like building a little human being,” says George, in the film’s production notes. Historically, the clockwork mechanisms of these automatons allowed for information – concerning the manual tasks that these entities would perform – “to be programmed in, letter by letter, so the amount that it could actually write or draw was quite limited. In our case, because it’s a computer program, it can draw absolutely anything.” In the film, which is based on Brian Selznick’s book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) tries to complete the repair process on the automaton, which is the only thing he has that connects him to his recently deceased father. Needless to say, the boy’s persistence and love pay off, and the automaton goes well beyond the call of duty by connecting the past to present, generating new relationships providing direction, and fueling hope. These are also nice qualities for businesses to brag about. Yes, Scorsese suffuses Hugo with the notion that the art of movie-making is a magical dream-engendering vocation. However, the automaton – 15 of them were built for the film, each one executing a different move or function – is a genuine inspiration for practical-minded entrepreneurs who want their companies to fulfill both self-expressive and financial goals. Consider the metallic guy and compare how the following check list aligns with your business. Your business gleams. Your enterprise fulfills customer desires. You and your premises inspire awe. You’re emotionally steady. You respond to heart-shaped – and other-shaped – requests. You work because you’ve programmed yourself to value output. And you work because it’s your self-ordained mission. Through your making other people happy, you’ve fixed yourself. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. The automaton from the movie Hugo, created by Dick George, served as a key character and represented a connection between the past and the present, as well as the potential for new relationships and hope. 2. The automaton's capabilities and qualities can be seen as a source of inspiration for entrepreneurs striving for their businesses to fulfill both self-expressive and financial goals. 3. Some important qualities that businesses can adopt from the automaton include: gleaming appearance, fulfilling customer desires, inspiring awe, emotional steadiness, responsiveness to various requests, valuing output, and having a self-ordained mission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A plot of the story below is true ... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The nowterrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum.

Q:Question: \\"What was the religion in Rome in 200 AD\\" Context: \\"The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism, but in 380 under Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire. Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus (d. 402) were rejected. Christianity became increasingly popular. Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, but Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In 200 AD, the predominant religion in Rome was Roman polytheism, also known as the Roman religion or the cultus deorum Romanorum. This ancient religion was characterized by the worship of a diverse pantheon of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Juno, Mars, and Venus, among many others. The religious practices involved offerings, prayers, and various rituals that were deeply embedded in the lives of Roman citizens. During this time, there was also growing influence and presence of other religions in the Roman Empire due to trade and cultural exchange. This included Mithraism (a mystery cult that worshiped the god Mithras), the cult of Isis (an Egyptian goddess), and Judaism. Christianity was also gradually gaining followers during this period, but it was not yet the official religion of the Roman Empire. It faced periods of persecution under emperors such as Nero, Domitian, and Diocletian. However, in the years following 200 AD, Christianity continued to grow until it eventually came to be the dominant religion, leading to the establishment of Nicene Christianity as the official state religion by Emperor Theodosius I in 380 AD. In summary, the religion in Rome in 200 AD was primarily Roman polytheism with a growing presence of other religions such as Mithraism, the cult of Isis, Judaism, and Christianity. The eventual official adoption of Christianity in 380 AD marked a significant shift in Roman religious practices and eventually led to the decline of the traditional Roman religion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home. Customers complained last night that stations were still shut after 9pm. Article:","completion":"Title: Fresh Talks to Resolve Dispute after Strike as Another 48-hour Stoppage Looms Introduction: Fresh talks were held today in an attempt to resolve a bitter dispute that led to a strike by members of the RMT and TSSA unions. The walkout, which caused significant disruption across the city, ended at 9 pm last night. However, a further 48-hour stoppage is planned for next Tuesday evening if no agreement is reached. Step 1: Describe the background of the strike and the unions involved. The walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions disrupted the daily commute for many people in the city. The dispute arose over issues concerning workers' rights and conditions. These two unions represent a large proportion of the workforce and their strike had a significant impact on the daily lives of commuters. Step 2: Highlight the end of the strike and the potential for a new round of strikes. Last night, the strike ended at 9 pm, providing some relief for commuters. However, a new 48-hour stoppage is scheduled for next Tuesday evening if no deal is reached during the fresh talks. This potential strike would once again cause major disruptions and inconvenience for city residents and commuters. Step 3: Show the impact on alternative modes of transportation. During the strike, many people turned to alternative modes of transportation, such as the Barclays bicycle hire scheme. Journeys on this service increased by 50% yesterday, providing a temporary solution for some commuters. However, this also highlights the need for a swift resolution to the dispute to avoid further complications. Step 4: Discuss the influence of weather on people's decisions to work from home. Wet and windy weather also played a part in the strike's impact, as many people chose to work from home rather than face the weather and disruption. This highlights the reliance on public transportation and the potential consequences of continued strikes. Step 5: Address complaints by customers about stations remaining closed after the strike ended. Customers expressed frustration last night, as some stations remained shut even after the strike's 9 pm conclusion. This raises concerns about the efficiency of the transportation network and its ability to recover quickly from such disruptions. Proper communication and planning will be crucial in dealing with future strikes, should they occur. Conclusion: The fresh talks held today are an essential step towards resolving the ongoing dispute between the RMT and TSSA unions and preventing further strikes. It is vital for all parties involved to find a solution that adequately addresses workers' concerns while minimizing disruptions to the public."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is selenium and how used Suggested answer: The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments . Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"Before validating the provided answer, let us examine the question and expand upon the suggested response. The question asks two things: what selenium is, and how it is used. The suggested answer briefly covers how selenium is used in commercial applications, but it does not thoroughly explain what selenium is. A more detailed response would be: Selenium is a chemical element with the symbol Se and atomic number 34. It is a non-metal that falls under the category of chalcogens in the periodic table, which also includes elements like oxygen, sulfur, and tellurium. Selenium has several allotropic forms, each with distinct physical properties. Its most stable form is a gray, metallic-looking hexagonal crystal known as hexagonal selenium. Selenium was discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius. Selenium is used in various applications, such as: 1. Glassmaking: Selenium, as a decolorizing agent or colorant, is added to glass to neutralize any green or yellow tints caused by other impurities such as iron and to achieve a desirable color, such as red and orange shades. 2. Pigments: Selenium is used to create various pigments for ceramics, plastics, and paint. Cadmium-selenium compounds produce bright shades of red, orange, and yellow. 3. Photovoltaic cells: Selenium, in combination with other elements, is used in the production of thhin-film solar panels which are thinner, lighter, and often more cost-effective than conventional silicon-based solar cells. 4. Electronics and semiconductors: Due to its photoconductive and semiconductor properties, selenium is used in photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, and photocells to convert light into electricity. Selenium in rectifiers can convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). 5. Metallurgy: In the metallurgical industry, selenium can be used as a refining agent for certain metals, helping remove impurities and enhancing their properties. 6. Agriculture: Selenium is essential for the growth of plants and the health of animals. As a trace element, it can be added to fertilizers and animal feed. It is important to maintain an appropriate balance, as excessive selenium levels can be toxic to plants and animals alike. To summarize, a more suitable answer for validation should include information about what selenium is, its various allotropic forms, its discovery, and its diverse applications. Therefore, while the suggested answer touches upon two of selenium's primary uses—glassmaking and pigments—it lacks essential details and context about the element itself and its wider uses. A more appropriate and complete response would address these other aspects, as outlined above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it. Question: suppose the plates are stable happens, how will it affect LESS or WEAKER earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the plates are stable, it will result in LESS or WEAKER earthquakes. To fully understand the impact of stable plates on earthquakes, it's essential to delve deeper into the process involved. The Earth's crust is made up of numerous tectonic plates that are constantly moving, albeit slowly. The boundaries where these plates meet are known as fault lines. Energy builds up in the Earth's crust as these plates continuously try to push or pull against one another. Eventually, the energy becomes too great, and the fault lines give way, causing the plates to move. This movement generates seismic waves, which radiate outward from the fault lines in all directions and are experienced as earthquakes. Now, let's suppose the plates become stable. This means that the Earth's plates would remain relatively stationary, with less pushing or pulling against one another. This scenario would result in a significant reduction in the energy that usually builds up in the Earth's crust. With less energy being channeled towards the fault lines, the pressure would decrease, and they would be less likely to give way. Consequently, the Earth's plates would experience less movement. As this movement is fundamentally responsible for the generation of seismic waves, any decrease in plate movement would directly impact the frequency and strength of seismic waves produced. This would translate to less energy radiating outward from the fault lines to cause earthquakes. Therefore, in a situation where the Earth's plates stabilize, there would be a notable decrease in the occurrence and intensity of earthquakes. In summary, stable plates would lead to LESS or WEAKER earthquakes. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the energy radiating outward from the fault lines, it is important to note the role this energy release plays in generating earthquakes. If stable plates result in less energy build-up, naturally, there would be less energy available to radiate outward from the fault lines. This reduced energy release would lead to a lesser effect on the second aspect mentioned as fewer seismic waves would be generated to cause earthquakes. Consequently, the perturbation caused by stable plates would result in a LESS effect on the energy radiating outward from the fault lines in the event of an earthquake."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To protect the soles of your feet from harm while outdoors,","completion":"Protecting the soles of your feet from harm while outdoors is essential, particularly when exploring rough terrains or engaging in outdoor activities. Proper foot care helps prevent injuries and ensures that your feet stay in good shape. Here are several detailed steps and precautions you can take to protect the soles of your feet from harm while outdoors: 1. Wear appropriate footwear: The most crucial aspect of protecting your feet is to select shoes or boots suitable for the terrain and activity you will be participating in. Look for footwear with sturdy soles made of materials like rubber, which provide both grip and cushioning. Choose shoes that enclose your toes to shield them from sharp rocks, roots, and sticks. 2. Select proper sizing: Ensuring a comfortable fit is another important aspect of footwear selection. Avoid shoes that are too tight or too loose, as they may lead to friction, blisters, and discomfort. It's generally a good idea to try on shoes later in the day when your feet might be slightly swollen. 3. Use moisture-wicking socks: Choose socks made from moisture-wicking materials like synthetic fibers or wool blends. These materials help remove moisture from your feet, reducing the risk of blisters and infections. Avoid cotton socks, as they tend to retain moisture. 4. Cushion your feet with insoles: If the soles of your shoes lack proper cushioning, consider adding removable insoles for additional support and comfort. The use of shock-absorbing insoles can reduce the impact of walking on hard surfaces, thereby minimizing the stress on the soles of your feet and preventing injuries. 5. Allow your feet to breathe: Give your feet frequent breaks, especially during long hikes or walks. Remove your shoes and socks to let your feet breathe and dry out any moisture. 6. Increase activity levels gradually: Avoid sudden increases in outdoor activities, as it could strain the muscles and tendons of your feet. Begin with shorter, less strenuous activities and gradually build up the intensity to prevent overloading your feet. 7. Keep your feet clean and dry: Wash your feet daily with soap and water, making sure to dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes. Keeping your feet clean and dry will help prevent blisters, infections, and other foot issues in the outdoors. 8. Use foot protection devices: Depending on the outdoor activity or terrain you are engaged in, you may need additional foot protection equipment such as shoe covers, waterproof socks, or toe guards. These devices can help protect your feet in extreme conditions or specific activities requiring added foot security. 9. Train your feet: Strengthening the muscles in your feet can help improve balance and stability, reducing the risk of injuries. Exercises that target the foot muscles, such as heel raises, toe curls, and ankle circles, can be incorporated into your fitness routine. 10. Practice proper foot hygiene: Trim your toenails regularly, cutting them straight across and filing down sharp edges. Moisturize your feet to prevent dryness, but avoid applying lotion between the toes to prevent fungal growth. By following these tips and precautions, you can effectively protect the soles of your feet from harm while outdoors and ensure that your feet stay healthy and comfortable during any outdoor activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which P.D. took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in your scenario, the Greenville Police Department took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime. This assessment is made based on their decision not to invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. Though these measures are deemed to have high costs as stated in the background article, they nevertheless add significant comprehensive and detailed dimensions to law enforcement. For instance, DNA testing and improved forensics can provide solid, tangible evidence that increases the likelihood of catching and prosecuting criminals while minimizing the chances of wrongful convictions. On the other hand, information technology can help in areas like data analysis, surveillance, communication, and crime prediction, making the police work more effective and efficient. Investments in these areas represent a comprehensive approach since they tackle crime-fighting from multiple angles. It's important to note, however, that taking a less comprehensive approach does not imply ineffectiveness. Greenville P.D. might be focusing on other effective conventional crime-fighting methods that might be more suitable for their specific situational needs and constraints. But to answer your question, in terms of comprehensive approaches that encompass modern technologies, it was Grayville P.D. that chose a path of broader crime-fighting strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Piracetam (sold under many brand names) is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name \\"2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide\\". It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

Patrice Emery Lumumba (alternatively styled Patrice Hemery Lumumba; 2 July 1925 - 17 January 1961) was a Congolese politician and independence leader who served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo) from June until September 1960. He played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and Pan-Africanist, he led the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party from 1958 until his death. Shortly after Congolese independence in 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo Crisis. Patrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 to a farmer, Francois Tolenga Otetshima, and his wife Julienne Wamato Lomendja, in Onalua in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo. He was a member of the Tetela ethnic group and was born with the name Elias Okit'Asombo. His original surname means \\"heir of the cursed\\" and is derived from the Tetela words okita/okito ('heir, successor') and asombo ('cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly'). He had three brothers (Ian Clark, Emile Kalema, and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother (Tolenga Jean). Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, where he passed the one-year course with distinction. Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba. Outside of his regular studies, Lumumba took an interest in the Enlightenment ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. He was also fond of Moliere and Victor Hugo. He wrote poetry, and many of his works had an anti-imperialist theme. He worked in Leopoldville and Stanleyville as a postal clerk and as a travelling beer salesman. In 1951, he married Pauline Opangu. In 1955, Lumumba became regional head of the Cercles of Stanleyville and joined the Liberal Party of Belgium, where he edited and distributed party literature. After a study tour in Belgium in 1956, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later to twelve months' imprisonment and a fine. So how did he get into a higher position?","completion":"Following his release from prison in 1957, Patrice Lumumba's political career took a crucial turn, and several factors contributed to his rise to a higher position: 1. Creation of MNC: In 1958, Lumumba co-founded the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), a nationalist political party that sought independence from Belgium and a united Congo under a central government. As the leader of the MNC, Lumumba became a prominent figure in Congo's struggle for independence. 2. The 1958 All-African Peoples' Conference: Lumumba attended this conference in Accra, Ghana, which was organized by Ghana's Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah. Here, Lumumba's fervent speeches and commitment to Pan-Africanism gained him recognition and support from other African leaders, solidifying his position as an influential political leader. 3. Strong oratory skills: Lumumba was well-known for his passionate speeches, charisma, and ability to connect with people of diverse backgrounds. This talent helped garner widespread support for both him and the MNC. 4. Belgian municipal elections: In December 1959, the MNC won a decisive victory in the Belgian Congo's municipal elections, confirming Lumumba's leadership and the party's popularity. This significantly strengthened Lumumba's political standing. 5. Round Table Conference: In January 1960, Lumumba and other Congolese leaders attended the Round Table Conference in Brussels, where they negotiated the terms of Congo's independence from Belgium. Lumumba's strong performance at the conference further boosted his reputation and political influence. Following these developments, on June 30, 1960, Congo gained independence from Belgium, and Lumumba was appointed as the newly-independent Democratic Republic of the Congo's first Prime Minister. His rise to power can be attributed to his political activism, powerful speeches, strong leadership, and ability to build alliances and gain recognition from his countrymen and other African leaders."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which... contains an answer for the question: What two compositions did Holst write in 1906?, what is it ?

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which experiment was more successful and appreciated? Hint: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

Information: - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The London Borough of Bromley is one of the 32 London Boroughs (plus the City) which make up Greater London. The London Borough of Bromley is south of the River Thames which flows through London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Bromley is the principal town in the London Borough of Bromley. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication. The algorithms are openly documented and may be used free of software patent restrictions.

It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead. - A holy well or sacred spring is a spring or other small body of water revered either in a Pagan or Christian context, often both. Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - Shortlands is a suburban village in the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London, England. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. - St Blaise 's Well is a holy well located in the grounds of the old Bishop 's Palace ( residence of Bishops of the see of Rochester until 1845 ) , now part of Bromley Civic Centre . in Bromley , Kent . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with Oleander's decision to use a publicity gimmick by releasing the single \\"Champion\\" and donating the proceeds to charity.

The reviewer also criticizes the song itself, describing it as weak, hasty, pro bono, sappy, cheesy, and contrived. They believe that it does not measure up to the rest of Oleander's work and suggests that the band could have done more to support the charity in a more genuine manner.

It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt.\\" Each person sits on a different colored patch. \\"Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,\\" Christakis said. \\"It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on.\\" And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered. \\"If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, \\" Fowler said. \\"A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,\\" he added.

Luis Suarez's lawyer has condemned FIFA's punishment of the Uruguay striker for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini as 'draconian, totalitarian and fascist', and said an appeal will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Speaking just before Barcelona and Liverpool confirmed reaching an agreement for the transfer of Suarez to the Catalan club, Alejandro Balbi reacted angrily to FIFA's announcement on Thursday that an initial appeal from both Suarez and the Uruguayan Football Federation (AUF) had been rejected. Suarez had appealed against FIFA's sanctions, which include a ban on 'all football-related activities' for four months, a nine-match ban from international football, as well as a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs (£66,000). The ban prohibits OPTIONS: - AUF from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Alejandro Balbi from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Barcelona from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - CAS from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Catalan from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Court of Arbitration for Sport from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Court of Arbitration of Sport from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - FIFA from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Giorgio Chiellini from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Italy from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Liverpool from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Luis Suarez from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Suarez from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Swiss from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Uruguay from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move. - Uruguayan Football Federation from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move.","completion":"Luis Suarez from attending football matches, training with Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by Barcelona following Suarez's move.

Along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller he is considered among the three foremost playwrights in 20th-century American drama. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Wind from Nowhere, first published in 1961 is the debut novel by English author J.G. Ballard. Prior to this, his published work had consisted solely of short stories. - James Graham \\"J. G.\\" Ballard (15 November 193019 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist. He came to be associated with the New Wave of science fiction early in his career with apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) novels such as \\"The Wind from Nowhere\\" (1961) and \\"The Drowned World\\" (1962). In the late 1960s, Ballard produced a variety of experimental short stories (or \\"condensed novels\\"), such as those collected in the controversial \\"The Atrocity Exhibition\\" (1970), which drew comparisons with the work of postmodernist writers such as William S. Burroughs. In the mid 1970s, he published several novels, among them the highly controversial \\"Crash\\" (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and \\"High-Rise\\" (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the mid-1950s in Britain and the late 1950s in the United States. Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular culture such as advertising and news. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, and/or combined with unrelated material. - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 August 2, 1997) was an American novelist, short story writer, satirist, essayist, painter, and spoken word performer. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author who wrote in the paranoid fiction genre, and his influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians, and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee. - Fleur Adcock, CNZM, OBE (born 10 February 1934) is a New Zealand poet and editor, of English and Northern Irish ancestry, who has lived much of her life in England. - Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century American theatre. Among his most popular plays are \\"All My Sons\\" (1947), \\"Death of a Salesman\\" (1949), \\"The Crucible\\" (1953) and \\"A View from the Bridge\\" (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on \\"The Misfits\\" (1961). The drama \\"Death of a Salesman\\" has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside \\"Long Day's Journey into Night\\" and \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\". - Eugene Gladstone O'Neill (October 16, 1888 November 27, 1953) was an American playwright and Nobel laureate in Literature. His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into American drama techniques of realism earlier associated with Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and Swedish playwright August Strindberg. The drama \\"Long Day's Journey into Night\\" is often numbered on the short list of the finest American plays in the 20th century, alongside Tennessee Williams's \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and Arthur Miller's \\"Death of a Salesman\\". - The Drowned World is a 1962 science fiction novel by J. G. Ballard. In contrast to much post-apocalyptic fiction, the novel features a central character who, rather than being disturbed by the end of the old world, is enraptured by the chaotic reality that has come to replace it. The novel is an expansion of an out of print novella of the same title published in \\"Science Fiction Adventures\\" magazine in January 1962, Vol. 4, No. 24. - Sir Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi (7 March 1924 22 April 2005) was a Scottish sculptor and artist.

Possible A: hockey game, cold weather, refrigerator, zoo, antarctica Why is \\"refrigerator\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"To determine why \\"refrigerator\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's analyze each of the possible answers in relation to the likelihood of finding ice. 1. Hockey game - Ice is present at a hockey game because the sport is played on an ice rink. Hence, you would be likely to find ice here. 2. Cold weather - In cold weather, it is common to see ice forming, especially in regions with below-freezing temperatures. Thus, you would likely find ice in cold weather. 3. Refrigerator - Although a refrigerator is designed to keep items cold, commonly it is not as cold as a freezer. Therefore, you would be less likely to find ice in a refrigerator compared to other options. This is why it aligns with human common sense as a less likely place to find ice. 4. Zoo - In a zoo, ice could be found in some enclosures for animals that require colder environments, like penguins. However, overall you'd be more likely to find ice in other options mentioned earlier. 5. Antarctica - As one of the coldest places on Earth, Antarctica is covered with ice and snow. You would definitely find ice there. Through this analysis, it's clear that \\"refrigerator\\" stands out as a less likely place to find ice compared to the other options. While there might be some ice in a refrigerator, it's not as omnipresent as it would be in a hockey game, cold weather regions, or Antarctica.

Answer the following question: If I want to maximize my number of potential customers, where should I build a new department store? - idaho - shopping mall - big city - in town - new york The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer to maximize your number of potential customers when building a new department store would be in a big city, preferably New York. There are several reasons for this: 1. Higher population density: Big cities like New York have a significantly higher population density compared to smaller cities, towns, or rural areas like Idaho. This means that there will be more potential customers living in a given area, which can lead to increased foot traffic and patronage in a department store. 2. Greater economic activity: Big cities typically have more robust economies, a higher concentration of wealth, and more disposable income. This translates to people having more money to spend on goods, which can be advantageous for a department store. 3. Tourist attraction: New York is a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors every year. Tourists often shop at department stores as a part of their visit, so building a store in a popular tourist destination can significantly increase the number of potential customers. 4. Greater demand for retail: In big cities, there is usually a higher demand for retail space and a more diverse customer base. This means that department stores, which offer a wide range of products, can cater to a larger audience and benefit from higher sales. 5. Higher visibility: Building a department store in a big city, like New York, offers greater visibility to consumers due to the sheer volume of people in such cities. This can lead to increased brand recognition and better consumer engagement. While building a department store within a shopping mall or in-town location can also generate considerable foot traffic, the sheer population size, economic activity, and tourist draw of a big city make it the best choice for maximizing your department store's potential customer base."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Cologne is about 45 km southwest of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of Dusseldorf and 25 km northwest of Bonn. Cologne is located on both sides of the Rhine, near Germany's borders with Belgium and the Netherlands. The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (\\"Kölner Dom\\") is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. The University of Cologne (\\"Universität zu Köln\\") is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities. Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman \\"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\\", from which it gets its name. \\"Cologne\\", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of \\"Germania Inferior\\" and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. 1. What does RAF stand for? 2.

Title: Still Off and Running Product review: Difficult to believe but that cerebral, fascinating series THE MENTALIST is already in its fourth season. Some of the subplots left as cliff hangers in season three have been settled and the series continues to make use of Simon Baker's terrific screen presence as Patrick Jane who is able to touch the untouchable aspects of people's minds in solving some very clever crimes. Baker's ability to carry off this enigmatic role is what makes the show tick, but it is his faithful crew of detecting minds that make the series always watchable and enjoyable - Robin Tunney as Lisbon the boss, and her associates Tim Kang, Owain Yeoman, and Amanda Rigetti. Some of the irony of Jane's abilities are growing a bit thin, but the scripts snap and the camaraderie that emanates from this group of detectives remains magical. So far, no disappointments. But the season just started so we have to wait and see how the entire season develops. Grady Harp, October 11 Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?

While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash.When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail.

CHAPTER XIX. THE NEW SMITHY. Sir Harry was sitting alone in the library when the tidings were brought to him that George Hotspur had reached Humblethwaite with a pair of post-horses from Penrith. The old butler, Cloudesdale, brought him the news, and Cloudesdale whispered it into his ears with solemn sorrow. Cloudesdale was well aware that Cousin George was no credit to the house of Humblethwaite. And much about the same time the information was brought to Lady Elizabeth by her housekeeper, and to Emily by her own maid. It was by Cloudesdale's orders that George was shown into the small room near the hall; and he told Sir Harry what he had done in a funereal whisper. Lady Altringham had been quite right in her method of ensuring the general delivery of the information about the house. Emily flew at once to her mother. \\"George is here,\\" she said. Mrs. Quick, the housekeeper, was at that moment leaving the room. \\"So Quick tells me. What can have brought him, my dear?\\" \\"Why should he not come, Mamma?\\" \\"Because your papa will not make him welcome to the house. Oh, dear,--he knows that. What are we to do?\\" In a few minutes Mrs. Quick came back again. Sir Harry would be much obliged if her ladyship would go to him. Then it was that the sandwiches and sherry were ordered. It was a compromise on the part of Lady Elizabeth between Emily's prayer that some welcome might be shown, and Sir Harry's presumed determination that the banished man should continue to be regarded as banished. \\"Take him some kind of refreshment, Quick;--a glass of wine or something, you know.\\" Then Mrs. Quick had cut the sandwiches with her own hand, and Cloudesdale had given the sherry. \\"He ain't eaten much, but he's made it up with the wine,\\" said Cloudesdale, when the tray was brought back again.

Question: What are the first names of the people that discover that Dren has a dangerously high fever? Answer the above question based on the context below: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

What is the best way to: how to use a hacksaw","completion":"The best way to use a hacksaw includes several steps to ensure safe, accurate, and efficient cutting. Here's a step-by-step process on how to use a hacksaw properly: 1. Gather necessary materials: Acquire a hacksaw, protective gloves, safety goggles, a clamp or vise, measuring tape, a pencil or marker, and a file. 2. Prepare the workspace: Clear any debris or objects from the work area and ensure there is sufficient lighting. Make sure you have a sturdy working surface, such as a workbench or a table. 3. Wear safety gear: Put on your protective gloves and safety goggles to reduce the risk of injury while using the hacksaw. 4. Secure the material: Firmly clamp or secure the material to be cut in a vise or with a clamp. This will prevent the object from moving or slipping while cutting. 5. Measure and mark: Using a measuring tape, measure the desired length of the cut and mark it with a pencil or marker. A straight edge or a square tool can help ensure the line marked is straight and accurate. 6. Select the correct blade: Hacksaw blades come with different teeth per inch (TPI). Choose a blade with a higher TPI for cutting thin, hard materials, and a lower TPI for cutting thicker materials. 7. Install the blade: Ensure the hacksaw blade is installed with the teeth facing forward (away from the handle). Tighten the tension of the blade using the wingnut on the frame to ensure the blade stays straight during cutting. 8. Position the hacksaw: Hold the hacksaw with both hands – one on the handle and the other supporting the frame near the blade. Ensure your body is in a comfortable and stable position to maintain control during the cutting process. 9. Begin cutting: Starting at the marked line, slowly and gently draw the hacksaw blade back towards you to create a groove. This initial groove will help guide the hacksaw for a straight and accurate cut. 10. Continue cutting: With the groove established, apply steady pressure and use long, even strokes to progress along the marked line. Try to use the full length of the blade with each stroke as this helps maintain a straight cut and prevents premature blade wear. 11. Finish the cut: As you near the end of the cut, slow down and carefully complete the cut to avoid damaging the material or causing the hacksaw to slip. 12. Smooth the edges: After the cut is complete, use a file to smooth any sharp edges or burrs left on the material. 13. Clean up: Safely dispose of any metal shavings or debris and return the hacksaw and other tools to their storage locations. By following these steps, you can efficiently and safely use a hacksaw to cut a variety of materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Two neighboring habitable planets from the same solar system, planet U and planet N, had Earth-like atmospheres. The inhabitants of planet U destroyed the ozone layer by their actions, while their neighboring planet N didn't. Which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays? A:","completion":"To determine which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays, we need to consider the effects of aerosol sprays on the ozone layer. Aerosol sprays containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances are known to contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. Given the information provided: 1. Planet U: Inhabitants destroyed the ozone layer by their actions. 2. Planet N: Inhabitants did not destroy the ozone layer. From these premises, we can infer the following: A. Inhabitants on planet U likely used more aerosol sprays containing ozone-depleting substances, which resulted in the destruction of the ozone layer. B. Inhabitants on planet N likely used fewer aerosol sprays containing ozone-depleting substances or used alternatives, which allowed their ozone layer to remain intact. Therefore, based on the information provided and the role of aerosol sprays in ozone depletion, we can conclude that planet N had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \\"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \\"Love Me Do\\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \\"Twist and Shout\\". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \\"We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\\". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \\"He was like our own little Elvis ... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\\" contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person that was like Elvis?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The last name of the person that was like Elvis in the mentioned article is Lennon. The reference is to John Lennon, one of the members of the Beatles.
